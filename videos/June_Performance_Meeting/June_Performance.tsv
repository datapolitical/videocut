140.597	141.919		Mr. Kroll, do you see any?	
144.127	147.313		 Chairman Guzman, this is Jack Crow, Executive Manager of the Board Office.	
147.333	151.78		There are no hands raised and there were no comments submitted in advance via writing.	
153.163	153.563		Thank you.	
156.569	160.836		With no participants in the queue, we will close the public comment period at this time.	
161.812	163.334		 We will move on to our discussion item.	
163.394	168.401		There is one discussion item on the agenda this morning, and that is for the 2025 Employee Survey.	
169.342	179.256		I would like to ask John McKay, Executive Business Partner, as well as Ben Seelius, Senior Performance Analyst, and Jake Studentmeyer, Manager of Market Research to present this item.	
181.98	183.101		Good morning, Chair Guzman.	
183.121	183.782		Thank you very much.	
184.964	188.629		This is our annual Employee Survey review.	
189.031	198.165		 I would like to, before we get started here, recognize that we do have a short amount of time to go through this, given the executive manager's check-in here in executive session in a little bit.	
198.285	202.131		I do want to note that these results will be soon available online.	
202.151	207.039		They are available in the packet right now, but they'll be posted to the performance dashboard in short order.	
207.72	215.472		And I also want to thank Ben Salius, Jake Studemeyer, all those who volunteered to participate and to lead this survey effort across the district.	
215.492	217.215		There were 16 in-person events.	
217.499	225.569		 As you know, this is held in relation to the work selection shift for the employees with respect to the run board.	
225.589	236.023		So as they are, as employees are selecting their workshops for the next service change, they are also able to lodge their results for the employee survey just so that we have a broader response.	
236.664	240.148		I'm going to move on to the next slide just to talk through the outline very briefly.	
240.128	241.751		 First, we'll do an introduction.	
241.791	244.175		I'll hand this over to Ben here in a moment.	
244.836	247.682		And Ben will go through all the nuts and bolts of the survey.	
247.702	254.273		We'll discuss the Employee Net Promoter Score for this year, which is our success outcome for the employee ownership strategic priority.	
255.335	262.508		Next, we'll go through the Composite Index Score, which I personally feel is a better indicator of employee ownership and engagement.	
262.488	268.235		 and we'll speak to the employee favorability in response to the prompts that were given in the survey.	
268.575	271.439		We'll go through some of the items that were that we saw a largest improvement.	
271.759	278.908		We'll talk about these strategic initiatives and then again we'll talk through the key takeaways which I'm going to right now not to bury the lead.	
278.948	283.433		There were a few major takeaways from from the survey activity for this year.	
283.413	288.987		 Again, we saw continued favorable response increase over the course of the year.	
289.729	298.452		Most, if not all of the elements in the survey were tracked higher than they did last year.	
298.432	301.998		 Next, we'll speak to the efficacy of efforts related to the improvement areas.	
302.058	304.321		So we'll talk about why things improved year over year.	
305.263	313.616		We saw that in 2024, if those of you who are on this committee last year, we saw this interesting little swoop in our survey results.	
313.636	321.368		We saw the first year we saw people had a generally higher favorability of RTD and employment here.	
321.82	327.271		 And then sort of tapered off over time and then eventually toward the longer the folks were here.	
327.332	332.342		We saw again increased higher favorability in response to some of these questions this year.	
332.362	334.527		We see a kind of a flatter curve.	
334.547	340.96		So again, that honeymoon period and then basically people are content once once they are here for more than a year.	
340.94	354.918		 Again, speaking to the difference between the employee net promoter score and the employee ownership composite index, we'll talk about which one of those two measures may be better for a point of reference if we're looking to see how we're doing you over year.	
355.538	363.088		And then we'll go through the key driver analysis, which helps us to determine areas of opportunity for improvement in the next year.	
363.288	368.635		So with that, I'm going to hand this over to Ben to go through some of the survey nuts and bolts.	
369.661	370.823		 Okay, good morning, everyone.	
370.883	372.807		Ben Selya, senior performance analyst.	
373.167	374.79		I'll give you a brief introduction here.	
374.91	384.127		I'll cover the survey purpose, the administration, the survey structure, as well as a brief snapshot of the response rate in the participation this year.	
385.128	386.05		Next slide, please.	
387.785	396.498		 The primary purpose of the employee survey as it relates to the board is it helps us populate the metrics for the agency performance scorecard.	
396.538	400.665		So that's probably where you're most familiar with the data that comes out of this survey.	
400.745	406.593		As you can see, all the metrics in this example here come straight out of the employee survey.	
406.614	407.895		So that's where we get that data.	
408.917	412.943		The survey also helps us collect direct employee feedback.	
413.244	416.188		We do that through not only the text field, but also	
416.489	419.575		 through the multiple choice questions.	
420.257	423.463		And it also gives us an understanding of employee satisfaction and engagement.	
423.523	427.912		So as you'll see in the next couple of slides, we have some questions directly aimed at that.	
427.952	432.0		It also provides us an opportunity for	
432.183	435.348		 insight into areas that may need some extra attention.	
435.828	442.879		That happens a lot through the free text field where employees are invited to basically free text responses to us.	
443.199	446.324		And we actually glean a lot of information out of that text box.	
447.225	447.986		Next slide, please.	
449.108	452.313		The administration happens over a four week survey period.	
452.333	455.457		This year it went from April 15th through May 16th.	
456.319	460.705		We expanded it one year, one week from last year to four weeks.	
461.309	466.116		 Like John said earlier, we did 16 in-person events at nine different facilities.	
467.217	475.089		We aim the in-person events primarily at the operational facilities where we have employees who do not spend a lot of time in front of a computer.	
475.149	479.655		So that helps us get the survey in front of them and get their voice into the survey.	
481.12	484.507		 We have a number of different methods that, yeah, let's roll back.	
484.908	487.153		We have a number of different methods that we're currently using.	
487.754	490.9		At the in-person events, we use a tablet as well as the printed survey.	
490.94	494.648		We have employees who refer one over the other, so we allow both.	
495.51	496.833		It's also done online.	
497.494	498.957		We promote that through the hub.	
499.298	501.863		We also include it in the hot sheet each week.	
502.282	511.656		 And we also push an icon to the desktops in the break rooms for operational personnel so they can simply click on an icon and take the survey online.	
512.818	514.981		And finally, we also do printed copies.	
516.123	523.134		We have a stack of copies that are just left in the break room and they can put those into a collection box at their leisure.	
524.135	524.796		Next slide.	
526.953	529.877		 The survey structure remains the same as it was last year.	
529.897	539.43		We have five job related questions that helps us parse out the information so we can tell how things are going at various locations, departments and divisions.	
540.271	544.316		We also ask the likeliness of recommendation as an employer.	
544.617	547.02		That's where we get the net promoter score data from.	
547.827	550.991		 We also ask about 11 internal services.	
551.092	555.978		So essentially we ask employees how satisfied they are with, say, IT department.	
555.998	557.14		And then we collect that.	
559.684	561.807		So ask a number of favorability questions.	
561.827	566.173		And that's primarily where the information from the agency scorecard comes from.	
566.593	571.921		Questions such as, does your supervisor treat you with respect?	
572.121	573.203		It's those kind of questions.	
574.004	577.108		And then we also have a retention-related question where we have	
577.578	585.045		 10 items and we ask the employees to rank them from one to 10 on how important they are for keeping them here as an employee at RTD.	
585.805	591.03		And then finally, we have the open-ended question where they're allowed to free text, whatever they want to tell us.	
592.251	592.671		Next slide.	
592.711	598.476		Here is a brief overview of the survey of the last three years.	
598.837	603.781		So we're at about 32% participation this year down a little bit from last year.	
603.841	606.083		We still have	
606.248	608.571		 Pretty good use of the paper survey options.	
608.591	612.755		So about 18% this year chose to use the paper survey over digital.	
614.818	619.443		And again, we stuck with 37 multiple choice questions in one question.	
621.065	621.506		Next slide.	
623.848	627.152		Here's a quick breakout of participation by work unit.	
627.292	630.636		As you can see, bus operations and rail operations makes up	
630.92	636.509		 a majority of our respondents, which makes sense as they are the larger groups within our organization.	
638.493	638.954		Next slide.	
640.837	650.413		And finally, here is a breakout of the surveys submitted by various tenure representation status and supervisory status.	
650.917	656.042		 10 year, we had very good participation from individuals who have been here for 10 plus years.	
656.102	660.386		That's great to see people still involved and engaged at 10 plus years.	
661.627	673.157		Representation status, this was at 50 split until the last week of the survey and then nonrepresented kind of pulled ahead probably because they were sitting at their computers that last week and took the survey.	
674.618	676.44		And then finally supervisory status.	
676.46	680.704		So while a large percentage is non supervisory,	
680.971	686.158		 The upshot of that is we are still getting very good voice from our frontline staff.	
688.201	691.927		Okay.	
691.947	694.69		Good morning, Jake Sudemeyer, Manager of Market Research.	
695.171	697.895		I'll go through the employee net promoter score.	
698.195	709.932		Again, a quick reminder, if you're not familiar with NPS and how it's calculated, when asking employees how likely they are to recommend working RTV friends or family, anyone answering as a nine or 10,	
710.317	712.54		 is classified as a promoter.	
712.9	718.608		Any one seven or eight is a passive and then zero through six are considered detractors.	
718.648	726.659		So the score is calculated by just subtracting the percentage of detractors from the promoters gives us our NPS score.	
726.679	732.507		So as you can see in 2024 our NPS was at negative two and this year we are at four.	
732.787	734.009		So we've got an improvement there.	
735.051	736.172		Next slide please.	
738.498	742.727		 And again, this shows you the actual percentages of those classifications.	
742.747	750.283		So you can see you take the 35% for promoters, subtract the 31% from the trackers, and gives our overall NPS of four.	
751.265	751.866		Next slide.	
752.825	758.391		 All right, for our composite index score, going through the employee ownership composite index score.	
758.672	774.63		Again, this is a average of employee survey scores related to how engaged, supported, safe feeling and understanding of how employees contribute to agency success, look at engagement, supervisor support, resource support, physical safety, safe from crime.	
775.015	776.357		 psychological safety.	
776.838	785.149		So I can see the big story here is a 16% increase from the score, from the percentage in 2023 to 2025.	
786.712	793.662		So this is anyone who answered either agree or strongly agree for those categories.	
794.883	796.546		Next slide.	
796.566	798.829		Sorry, we have a new kitten and she is attacking me.	
800.75	805.258		 looking at the individual questions from the index itself.	
805.795	814.807		 Again, the big story here is the marked improvement year over year from 2023 into 2024 and continued on into 2025.	
815.668	822.316		Probably the biggest story here on this page is at the very bottom looking at feeling safe from crime in the work environment.	
822.877	832.95		From just 45% in 2023 of employees saying they agree or strongly agree that statement to now 70% in 2025.	
833.47	838.176		 So even a decent improvement over 2024s as well.	
839.237	839.737		Next slide.	
842.641	846.506		These are the overall composite index scores broken out by tenure.	
847.387	858.6		So if we look at those less than one year, this really is the only instance I believe in this, at least my set in the slide deck, where we actually see 2024 outscoring 2025.	
858.58	867.776		 There, you know, we had 88% answering the degree or strongly disagree for their overall composite index to 78 for 2025.	
867.836	870.06		But again, marked improvement year over year.	
870.12	876.371		And then again, looking compared to 2023, pretty substantial improvement.	
877.653	878.394		Next slide.	
879.256	881.179		All right, for employee favorability.	
881.851	896.785		 More of the same, again marked improvement year after year every year, and kind of reiterating the employee safety, feeling safe in my work environment, just 64% in 2023, up to 83% now in 2025.	
898.847	899.408		Next slide.	
902.451	904.092		Again, more of the same here.	
909.137	910.018		All right, next.	
915.652	920.039		 Again, pretty, I am a jungle gym this morning.	
923.464	924.205		All right, next slide.	
929.994	938.267		Again, the safety perceptions, probably the largest marked improvement out of all the metrics.	
942.736	948.215		 And again, looking again now at favorability as opposed to the Kamazza Index score by tenure.	
948.235	954.838		A little bit closer this time, especially amongst those very new to RTB less than a year.	
957.333	958.355		 jumping in here just briefly.	
958.375	964.748		This is the curve that I had mentioned in my opening remarks here that we see that there's again this honeymoon period within the first year.	
964.788	973.725		Again, 15% improvement over 2023, but same as last year in the 89% up here and then sort of an evening and out over here.	
973.766	979.577		So starting at 79% for one to three years, going down to 77% for 10 or more years, but you can see this is	
979.557	999.366		 roughly within the margin of error all four categories after the first year and in 2023 you could see that that swoop that's starting off and then over time people are generally maybe a little bit less favorable and then a slight increase at the end but this is nice to see the employees across the their tenure are satisfied and more so this year than before.	
999.427	1004.434		All right next slide.	
1006.051	1015.423		 So here just to highlight some of the year over year improvements, looking at the statement, I have trust in my departmental managers to make decisions that align with the values of the organization.	
1015.783	1018.667		You see an 8% increase from last year to this year.	
1019.147	1024.634		And again, broken out on the right hand side in terms of supervisory status as well as representation.	
1028.139	1031.463		And again, for I have the resources to successfully perform my duties.	
1031.483	1035.788		7% increase from last year to this year.	
1040.341	1046.808		 And here highlighting those aspects that had a improvement over 5% from last year.	
1054.037	1058.602		And now significant meaning 15% or more improvement over the last two years.	
1059.062	1067.732		A quick note, this does not mean statistical significance, just significance in terms of the percentage of increase from year over year.	
1072.184	1074.57		 All right, next and continuing on.	
1074.61	1082.329		All right.	
1084.823	1087.045		 and it comes back to me at this point.	
1087.426	1095.855		So, noting that that market improvement year-over-year, especially over the two-year window, would not be possible without some of the efforts that were put in by staff.	
1095.875	1098.818		So, those are the strategic initiatives that are developed year-over-year.	
1099.619	1108.688		Specifically, with respect to the employee survey, those are back-to-basics people, power and welcoming transit environment, the fourth being customer and community connections, which isn't really gauged by the survey.	
1108.668	1123.812		 So moving forward, back to basics in 2023-24, one of the tactics developed was surrounding internal communication and you can see over that two year period there's been a 20% increase in employee responses to the prompt.	
1123.912	1126.717		I am adequately informed about agency news projects and initiatives.	
1126.757	1129.461		This is due to some internal communications enhancements.	
1129.66	1136.147		 including changes to the way that we distribute our internal newsletter, crew meetings, things like that.	
1136.187	1144.355		People are feeling more generally informed all the way from 50% from represented staff up to 67% currently.	
1145.877	1148.68		Moving into, excuse me, employer retention is next.	
1149.421	1157.389		We see this wedge here, this pie chart here strongly agree 57% and 27% agree.	
1157.757	1159.859		 that they will be working in RTD one year from now.	
1160.04	1167.127		Our senior manager of Total Rewards said that this is incredibly, he's coming from the private sector.	
1167.147	1170.471		He said, I've never seen anything like this in an agency public or otherwise.	
1170.671	1173.675		So this isn't very good to see.	
1174.556	1184.467		Moving forward to the top three most important employment and workplace characteristics, we ask folks to rank their top 10, or the 10 that we offer them there.	
1185.147	1186.549		We're asked to rank	
1186.529	1194.663		 Ranked their top three and you can see the fair compensation 2024 was by far and away the most important work characteristic.	
1194.803	1196.446		We move forward to 2025.	
1196.886	1197.407		It's about the same.	
1197.447	1199.831		It's actually considerably less than the top end.	
1200.032	1203.137		And then there are some other things that are that have risen in importance, including.	
1203.117	1208.686		 Tools and equipment which is new to this is risen a lot more than that I would have anticipated.	
1209.187	1214.756		We need to delve into what this means to individual people that could mean a lot of things to 3000 different people.	
1214.797	1217.581		This could be, you know, wrenches and things to mechanics.	
1217.601	1222.489		This could mean it equipment for certain people tablets and things.	
1222.509	1224.653		We'll have to delve into see what that means for folks.	
1224.633	1227.618		 moving into our key driver analysis for 2025.	
1227.698	1233.527		We've seen that there were two other areas of opportunity in 2024.	
1233.567	1238.835		Those were, I believe, manageable workloads and professional development opportunities.	
1238.855	1246.988		Those sort of increased, and so they've fallen out of the areas of opportunity box down at the bottom right-hand corner, just briefly walking through this.	
1247.409	1250.674		Most of the folks on this meeting have seen this before.	
1251.194	1256.496		 But on this chart here, the higher, the farther along the y-axis.	
1256.729	1262.718		 It goes to the top that indicates higher satisfaction with RTD and RTD services.	
1262.939	1269.569		And then the higher importance it is to individual employees based on this ranking activity that we asked them to do.	
1270.089	1275.999		And so we can see that fair compensation is really close to the mean, can still possibly use some improvement.	
1276.059	1284.171		And maybe this is surrounding employee communication around their compensation or opportunities for them	
1284.505	1287.668		 use their professional development funds and things like that.	
1287.768	1290.851		So they can use that for their own personal benefit.	
1291.291	1296.115		And also opportunities for advancement is another area that we'll be taking a look at in 2025-26.	
1297.697	1300.88		Moving again to the employee security.	
1300.92	1305.584		As we said before, this has increased 25% over a two-year period.	
1305.604	1306.645		This is incredible.	
1306.925	1312.47		This is still the lowest score, the lowest favorable response of all of the survey responses.	
1312.45	1320.804		 We can see a lot of the efforts that have been put into, you know, increasing welcoming transit environment within Union Station and then across the district.	
1321.126	1322.933		All of these efforts are taking hold.	
1323.638	1325.38		 Again, key takeaways.	
1325.78	1330.406		We can see that there was a continued favorable response increase.	
1331.046	1337.053		We can see that the efforts that we've been engaging in to improve some of those scores have really had taken effect.	
1337.454	1338.815		They've improved those scores.	
1339.916	1346.464		We see that higher favorability is less influenced by tenure in 2025, noting that flattened curve from year one and beyond.	
1348.066	1353.612		Talking again about the employee net promoter score versus the employee ownership composite index.	
1354.115	1377.388		 We can see that if I were to go back to the one pager that showed the agency performance scorecard toward the beginning of this presentation, all of those five metrics that we consider to be performance metrics, key performance metrics for this particular strategic priority, we can see that those numbers are moving considerably, but the employee net promoter score is not	
1377.773	1378.694		 raising as much.	
1378.915	1381.278		So there's less linkage there than we would like.	
1381.378	1389.911		So I think that that employee composite index may serve as a better success, overall success metric in future years.	
1389.931	1392.034		And that's something that we had raised in last year.	
1392.074	1393.196		We're seeing that again this year.	
1393.717	1398.504		And again, the key driver analysis that I just showed highlights the opportunities for 2025 and 26.	
1398.544	1403.832		And with that, we have finished the presentation and are open to questions from the board.	
1405.6	1406.341		 Thank you very much.	
1406.521	1408.644		Are there any questions or comments from the committee?	
1409.546	1411.428		Director Nicholson, I saw your hand shoot up first.	
1413.07	1414.693		I try to be quick on the draw.	
1415.334	1416.655		Thank you for the presentation.	
1416.736	1417.657		It was wonderful.	
1417.717	1419.82		I enjoyed reading that over this morning.	
1420.321	1429.674		I found the distinctions between the different employee types and the represented versus non-represented really interesting.	
1429.734	1432.738		And I just wanted to ask, can we get	
1432.955	1447.437		 those numbers broken down by the different employee types that you mentioned at the beginning of the spreadsheet because you had a couple of different departments in their bus operations, rail operations, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.	
1448.199	1460.177		I would just be fascinated to look at, not just represented versus non-represented, but among our different types of employees, is there a meaningful difference in	
1460.157	1470.655		 the key drivers of what they're looking for is their difference in, for example, fair compensation being an issue in some departments over others.	
1470.695	1479.05		So just, is that something that you could provide to board members a bit more granular breakdown of those numbers?	
1480.232	1480.933		Mr. McKay.	
1481.504	1482.485		 Thank you, Mr. Chair.	
1482.525	1485.768		I would say that the employees are saying that that is an important factor.	
1485.808	1487.589		They're not saying that that's an issue right now.	
1487.609	1491.613		I just want to make that distinction that we ask them to rank there at the most important characteristics.	
1491.633	1495.076		That's not to say that somebody is disappointed with their current salary.	
1495.096	1500.982		They're just saying that is an important employment characteristic just to make that draw that specific line.	
1501.002	1510.93		And as far as more granular data, if you have specific asks about, if you can tell me which one you're interested in the most are a few of them, we can delve into that data.	
1511.051	1511.511		Thank you.	
1511.98	1512.32		 Awesome.	
1512.341	1513.122		I'll send you an email.	
1515.285	1517.748		Madam CEO, I saw your hand go up and then it went down.	
1517.869	1518.67		Did that get covered?	
1520.072	1520.592		Yes, it did.	
1520.613	1534.793		And I was just going to put in a different element as well, recognizing as we talk about this, considering that we do bargain for wages with two thirds of our workforce and considering the time at which this was done, that could be a factor as well.	
1534.833	1539.64		But Mr. McKay answered the question is best suited, which I believe addressed my concerns as well.	
1539.981	1541.683		Not my concerns, my response.	
1542.507	1542.807		 Great.	
1543.729	1544.37		Director Catlin.	
1546.893	1550.038		Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I am a GMCEO Johnson.	
1550.098	1553.262		I appreciate your context for that.	
1553.723	1559.291		I just wanted to say I reviewed this over the weekend and I was really encouraged.	
1559.591	1562.976		I thought the trend was very, very positive.	
1562.996	1570.927		So I just wanted to say I appreciate the further explanation today, but I just wanted to say that this looked really good.	
1571.027	1571.468		Thank you.	
1573.169	1573.69		 Mr. McKay.	
1574.771	1580.097		If you like these results, just wait till you hear the customer and community results on the meeting on the 23rd, just a plug for the next meeting.	
1583.441	1584.862		Vice Chair Guzman is your turn.	
1586.324	1588.527		Thank you, Chair Guzman.	
1588.607	1590.509		Thank you very much for the presentation.	
1590.929	1597.557		My question, is there any sort of target for the survey participation?	
1600.068	1602.592		 Not a target per se, Mr. Chair, if I may.	
1602.612	1602.872		Please.	
1603.473	1604.174		Not a target per se.	
1604.194	1611.724		We like to see, you know, a couple of years ago, we had a 47 percent rate, and that's incredible.	
1612.646	1619.976		Jake Studemeyer, who's also on this call, he has said that both private and public sector, 20 to 30 percent is considered good.	
1620.056	1621.779		So we're over 30 percent.	
1621.879	1622.86		That's fantastic.	
1622.88	1627.847		We have heard from people in the open-ended comments at the end that they're feeling a little bit of survey fatigue.	
1628.047	1636.977		 So there is an opportunity perhaps in 2026 to maybe do a smaller scale or just to make sure that we're still hitting the same the same.	
1638.618	1648.409		Stuff that you know the strategic plan elements as long as we're capturing those things somehow we'll talk about that internally to figure out how best we can we can roll out a different survey next year.	
1650.571	1651.132		OK, thank you.	
1651.172	1657.699		Yeah, I mean, I just I feel like 32% a little low and I would love to.	
1658.59	1672.871		 see us somehow, you know, creatively think about how can we improve that number, whether it's like a departmental competition and the department with the highest participation percentage gets a pizza party.	
1673.031	1681.364		You know, it's something I just, I feel like there's opportunity to improve that even though 30 to, you know, 20, 30% is considered good.	
1682.926	1683.467		Madam CEO.	
1684.072	1684.853		 Yes, thank you.	
1684.893	1694.722		I was going to have Mr. Studermeyer expound, but before I do that, recognizing the vice chair's comments, we do have full fledged engagement and recognizing you are talking about incentivizing individuals.	
1695.082	1705.572		We do give giveaways, we give food, we do a lot of different things and recognizing that the intent behind garnering as much feedback as we can, considering the two thirds of our workforce are out on the front lines.	
1705.632	1711.598		We intentionally, as Mr. McKay said, do that during the bid selection process with their work shifts.	
1711.578	1716.383		 and recognizing that we want to see a greater representation.	
1716.403	1733.28		This is statistically valid, and I was just going to offer, and being on a public agency space, this response rate is heading shoulders above the crowd, recognizing that other agencies, and this is from my own experience, working at six other transit agencies beside this one, really is something to applaud.	
1733.84	1738.345		Mr. Studemeyer, you want to expand referencing the participation rate	
1738.865	1739.586		 Absolutely.	
1739.646	1740.007		Thank you.	
1740.688	1746.698		So, again, having nearly a third of our workforce taking the survey is great.	
1747.48	1748.562		Good is one word to use it.	
1748.822	1750.305		Getting up close to a third is great.	
1751.527	1752.789		It's a fine balance.	
1752.809	1756.315		I understand the want and the desire to have more participation.	
1756.355	1758.679		Again, more participation is always good.	
1758.659	1760.301		 It is a fine balance, though.	
1761.322	1766.989		When you start to push for more and more completion, it can drive something similar to the Hawthorne effect.	
1767.25	1777.362		If anyone's familiar with psychology and research, folks alter their responses when they know they're being watched or being pushed towards something.	
1777.402	1786.253		So if you're really, really, really heavy on participation, it can actually drive up feelings of paranoia or concern like, why are they wanting so much participation?	
1786.233	1799.411		 So again, not that there isn't more that we can do to encourage participation, but again, it is a very fine balance between encouraging participation and, you know, mandating participation for lack of a better word.	
1803.617	1804.538		All right, Director Bezek.	
1805.9	1806.44		Thanks very much.	
1806.48	1807.522		Thanks for the presentation.	
1807.802	1815.733		With regard to the participation, my guess without any scientific background is much like Google reviews, right?	
1815.899	1816.44		 I'm happy.	
1816.46	1817.561		I'm not going to participate.	
1817.821	1818.502		I'm unhappy.	
1818.562	1821.065		I'm going on Google and I'm giving you one stock.	
1821.085	1824.029		So maybe the lack of participation says something.	
1824.149	1833.06		But overall, I think the improvement that we're seeing over these several years is really all down to GM CEO Johnson and her team.	
1833.801	1840.629		And I'm not surprised that it takes time because as we all know, when change is implemented, people get there, you know, that people don't like it.	
1841.45	1843.813		But then as time goes on and they see that the changes are good,	
1844.553	1847.644		 then they realize that it was the right thing to do and they're much happier.	
1847.684	1850.936		So I think that's what we're seeing here when we look at this over a period of time.	
1850.956	1854.951		So hats off to you, GM CEO Johnson, thanks for the presentation.	
1858.542	1859.884		 Okay, thank you.	
1860.245	1874.106		I want to tell you I was happy to see this because safe and happy employees make safe and happy customers in the same way that safe and happy baristas make safe and happy customers at my other job.	
1874.126	1880.196		So I am excited to see the correlation and what's coming up with customer experience surveys.	
1880.446	1882.068		 in a couple of weeks.	
1882.389	1888.138		So, gentlemen, thank you, and thank you for keeping the presentation tight so we can move on to other matters.	
1888.498	1889.179		Thank you so much.	
1890.401	1894.487		Are there any other matters to discuss before we move into the executive session?	
1896.47	1897.071		Chair Buque.	
1898.148	1898.989		 Yeah, thank you very much.	
1899.029	1899.73		Share Guzman.	
1900.491	1902.614		I just wanted to take this moment real quick.	
1903.655	1907.82		Yesterday, there appeared to be an anti-Semitic attack that occurred in Boulder.	
1908.882	1919.515		I just want to say that the heart of this agency, the heart of this board go out to you, Director Geisinger, your constituents, Boulder community,	
1919.495	1924.501		 the Jewish community not only here in Colorado, but the Jewish community is all across the world.	
1925.322	1939.118		So I just wanted to acknowledge that as an agency that, again, as we mentioned during our executive committee a couple of weeks ago, you can't fight hate with hate.	
1939.639	1943.583		Love always wins in the long run and that this agency's heart is with all of you.	
1943.904	1944.304		Thank you.	
1949.667	1950.047		 Thank you.	
1954.773	1956.435		Sorry, I have to hold space for a minute.	
1957.436	1958.938		Are there any other matters to discuss?	
1962.121	1962.402		All right.	
1963.102	1968.489		As a reminder, our next meeting will be Monday, June 23rd at 830 a.m.	
1968.849	1973.194		At that meeting, we are set to discuss the results of our customer and community surveys.	
1976.347	1990.182		 In a moment, the committee will meet in executive session to further our dialogue with the general manager CEO regarding her performance in meeting the agency values for and based off duties and the progress towards her 2025 short term goals.	
1991.264	1998.692		I would like to append the motion to move into executive session to state that the performance committee will be deemed adjourned.	
1999.195	2001.179		 after it adjourns into the executive session.	
2001.7	2007.954		For public transparency, this means that once the committee moves into executive session, the main meeting will be adjourned.	
2008.755	2012.884		I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following.	
2013.792	2027.553		 pursuant to Section 24-6-402, Open Paran-4, Close Paran, Open Paran-F, Close Paran, Open Paran-I, Close Paran of the Colorado Revised Statutes.	
2028.014	2032.24		For consideration of personnel matters regarding the Board's dialogue	
2032.22	2044.452		 with the general manager and CEO on her performance in meeting the agency values core based job duties and progress towards her 2025 short term goals and input from the board of directors on the same.	
2044.492	2046.954		Do I have a motion?	
2047.555	2048.296		Music.	
2049.477	2049.777		Second.	
2051.298	2054.141		I have music as the movement and Caitlin as the second.	
2055.262	2058.025		Are there any no votes on this action?	
2062.038	2066.264		 Seeing none, then our regular session is adjourned at 904am.	
2066.665	2070.611		Directors, please move over to the executive session.	
2070.871	2071.953		Oh, sorry, Melanie.	
2073.075	2078.603		Okay, please move over to the executive session and allow a few minutes for everybody to move over.	
2078.943	2079.304		Thank you.

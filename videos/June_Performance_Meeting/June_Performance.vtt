00:00.031 --> 00:02.015
Second performance committee will now come to order.

00:02.416 --> 00:04.440
We are convened as of 8.30 a.m.

00:04.460 --> 00:09.991
I would respectfully ask everyone attending this meeting to meet yourself unless you are recognized to speak.

00:10.893 --> 00:19.491
Please note that the committee meetings of the RTD Board of Directors will be held remotely via Zoom and will be audio and video recorded.

00:20.770 --> 00:27.820
The meeting recordings along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings will be posted as soon as practicable on the board's website.

00:27.840 --> 00:35.971
During today's committee meeting, we are providing communication access, real time translation, also known as CART.

00:37.093 --> 00:49.090
Anyone who would like to access this service should send an email to the board of office at rtd.boardoffice at rtd-denver.com and a link will be provided.

00:50.369 --> 00:58.379
Additionally, the CART transcript can be automatically translated into Spanish for anyone who would like access to a live transcript of this meeting.

00:59.861 --> 01:03.666
A live stream of this meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.990
I would now like to call the role of the committee members.

01:07.571 --> 01:08.352
Director Vince Buzik.

01:09.173 --> 01:09.513
Present.

01:10.374 --> 01:11.295
Director Lynn Geisinger.

01:12.036 --> 01:12.277
Here.

01:13.638 --> 01:14.980
Vice Chair Chris Gutschenritter.

01:16.102 --> 01:16.302
Here.

01:16.362 --> 01:18.064
Director Matt Larson.

01:18.635 --> 01:18.936
Here.

01:19.817 --> 01:20.939
Director Chris Nicholson.

01:21.761 --> 01:22.122
Present.

01:22.923 --> 01:23.985
Director Peggy Catlin.

01:26.069 --> 01:26.330
Here.

01:26.350 --> 01:29.075
I am Chair Michael Guzman.

01:29.636 --> 01:32.141
I also see Board Chair Julian Bouquet has joined us.

01:33.203 --> 01:36.008
And I do not see anybody else on my screen.

01:36.048 --> 01:37.451
All right.

01:38.012 --> 01:41.098
If they join, help me keep track, guys.

01:42.479 --> 01:43.923
Alright, we'll move into public comment.

01:44.144 --> 01:53.169
I would like to open the public comment to anyone who would like to address the committee regarding any topic listed in the published meeting agenda for the current and immediately preceding month.

01:54.092 --> 01:57.602
If you wish to speak and have not already done so.

01:57.987 --> 02:01.932
Please either raise your virtual hand or press star 9 on your phone.

02:03.034 --> 02:06.518
During this time, the committee will not offer any direct comments or responses.

02:07.119 --> 02:18.755
However, if you would like to be contacted regarding your public comment, please email the RTD board at rtd.directors at rtd-denver.com.

02:18.775 --> 02:20.397
I don't see any hands raised on the screen.

02:20.597 --> 02:21.919
Mr. Kroll, do you see any?

02:24.127 --> 02:27.313
Chairman Guzman, this is Jack Crow, Executive Manager of the Board Office.

02:27.333 --> 02:31.780
There are no hands raised and there were no comments submitted in advance via writing.

02:33.163 --> 02:33.563
Thank you.

02:36.569 --> 02:40.836
With no participants in the queue, we will close the public comment period at this time.

02:41.812 --> 02:43.334
We will move on to our discussion item.

02:43.394 --> 02:48.401
There is one discussion item on the agenda this morning, and that is for the 2025 Employee Survey.

02:49.342 --> 02:59.256
I would like to ask John McKay, Executive Business Partner, as well as Ben Seelius, Senior Performance Analyst, and Jake Studentmeyer, Manager of Market Research to present this item.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.101
Good morning, Chair Guzman.

03:03.121 --> 03:03.782
Thank you very much.

03:04.964 --> 03:08.629
This is our annual Employee Survey review.

03:09.031 --> 03:18.165
I would like to, before we get started here, recognize that we do have a short amount of time to go through this, given the executive manager's check-in here in executive session in a little bit.

03:18.285 --> 03:22.131
I do want to note that these results will be soon available online.

03:22.151 --> 03:27.039
They are available in the packet right now, but they'll be posted to the performance dashboard in short order.

03:27.720 --> 03:35.472
And I also want to thank Ben Salius, Jake Studemeyer, all those who volunteered to participate and to lead this survey effort across the district.

03:35.492 --> 03:37.215
There were 16 in-person events.

03:37.499 --> 03:45.569
As you know, this is held in relation to the work selection shift for the employees with respect to the run board.

03:45.589 --> 03:56.023
So as they are, as employees are selecting their workshops for the next service change, they are also able to lodge their results for the employee survey just so that we have a broader response.

03:56.664 --> 04:00.148
I'm going to move on to the next slide just to talk through the outline very briefly.

04:00.128 --> 04:01.751
First, we'll do an introduction.

04:01.791 --> 04:04.175
I'll hand this over to Ben here in a moment.

04:04.836 --> 04:07.682
And Ben will go through all the nuts and bolts of the survey.

04:07.702 --> 04:14.273
We'll discuss the Employee Net Promoter Score for this year, which is our success outcome for the employee ownership strategic priority.

04:15.335 --> 04:22.508
Next, we'll go through the Composite Index Score, which I personally feel is a better indicator of employee ownership and engagement.

04:22.488 --> 04:28.235
and we'll speak to the employee favorability in response to the prompts that were given in the survey.

04:28.575 --> 04:31.439
We'll go through some of the items that were that we saw a largest improvement.

04:31.759 --> 04:38.908
We'll talk about these strategic initiatives and then again we'll talk through the key takeaways which I'm going to right now not to bury the lead.

04:38.948 --> 04:43.433
There were a few major takeaways from from the survey activity for this year.

04:43.413 --> 04:48.987
Again, we saw continued favorable response increase over the course of the year.

04:49.729 --> 04:58.452
Most, if not all of the elements in the survey were tracked higher than they did last year.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.998
Next, we'll speak to the efficacy of efforts related to the improvement areas.

05:02.058 --> 05:04.321
So we'll talk about why things improved year over year.

05:05.263 --> 05:13.616
We saw that in 2024, if those of you who are on this committee last year, we saw this interesting little swoop in our survey results.

05:13.636 --> 05:21.368
We saw the first year we saw people had a generally higher favorability of RTD and employment here.

05:21.820 --> 05:27.271
And then sort of tapered off over time and then eventually toward the longer the folks were here.

05:27.332 --> 05:32.342
We saw again increased higher favorability in response to some of these questions this year.

05:32.362 --> 05:34.527
We see a kind of a flatter curve.

05:34.547 --> 05:40.960
So again, that honeymoon period and then basically people are content once once they are here for more than a year.

05:40.940 --> 05:54.918
Again, speaking to the difference between the employee net promoter score and the employee ownership composite index, we'll talk about which one of those two measures may be better for a point of reference if we're looking to see how we're doing you over year.

05:55.538 --> 06:03.088
And then we'll go through the key driver analysis, which helps us to determine areas of opportunity for improvement in the next year.

06:03.288 --> 06:08.635
So with that, I'm going to hand this over to Ben to go through some of the survey nuts and bolts.

06:09.661 --> 06:10.823
Okay, good morning, everyone.

06:10.883 --> 06:12.807
Ben Selya, senior performance analyst.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.790
I'll give you a brief introduction here.

06:14.910 --> 06:24.127
I'll cover the survey purpose, the administration, the survey structure, as well as a brief snapshot of the response rate in the participation this year.

06:25.128 --> 06:26.050
Next slide, please.

06:27.785 --> 06:36.498
The primary purpose of the employee survey as it relates to the board is it helps us populate the metrics for the agency performance scorecard.

06:36.538 --> 06:40.665
So that's probably where you're most familiar with the data that comes out of this survey.

06:40.745 --> 06:46.593
As you can see, all the metrics in this example here come straight out of the employee survey.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.895
So that's where we get that data.

06:48.917 --> 06:52.943
The survey also helps us collect direct employee feedback.

06:53.244 --> 06:56.188
We do that through not only the text field, but also

06:56.489 --> 06:59.575
through the multiple choice questions.

07:00.257 --> 07:03.463
And it also gives us an understanding of employee satisfaction and engagement.

07:03.523 --> 07:07.912
So as you'll see in the next couple of slides, we have some questions directly aimed at that.

07:07.952 --> 07:12.000
It also provides us an opportunity for

07:12.183 --> 07:15.348
insight into areas that may need some extra attention.

07:15.828 --> 07:22.879
That happens a lot through the free text field where employees are invited to basically free text responses to us.

07:23.199 --> 07:26.324
And we actually glean a lot of information out of that text box.

07:27.225 --> 07:27.986
Next slide, please.

07:29.108 --> 07:32.313
The administration happens over a four week survey period.

07:32.333 --> 07:35.457
This year it went from April 15th through May 16th.

07:36.319 --> 07:40.705
We expanded it one year, one week from last year to four weeks.

07:41.309 --> 07:46.116
Like John said earlier, we did 16 in-person events at nine different facilities.

07:47.217 --> 07:55.089
We aim the in-person events primarily at the operational facilities where we have employees who do not spend a lot of time in front of a computer.

07:55.149 --> 07:59.655
So that helps us get the survey in front of them and get their voice into the survey.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.507
We have a number of different methods that, yeah, let's roll back.

08:04.908 --> 08:07.153
We have a number of different methods that we're currently using.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.900
At the in-person events, we use a tablet as well as the printed survey.

08:10.940 --> 08:14.648
We have employees who refer one over the other, so we allow both.

08:15.510 --> 08:16.833
It's also done online.

08:17.494 --> 08:18.957
We promote that through the hub.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.863
We also include it in the hot sheet each week.

08:22.282 --> 08:31.656
And we also push an icon to the desktops in the break rooms for operational personnel so they can simply click on an icon and take the survey online.

08:32.818 --> 08:34.981
And finally, we also do printed copies.

08:36.123 --> 08:43.134
We have a stack of copies that are just left in the break room and they can put those into a collection box at their leisure.

08:44.135 --> 08:44.796
Next slide.

08:46.953 --> 08:49.877
The survey structure remains the same as it was last year.

08:49.897 --> 08:59.430
We have five job related questions that helps us parse out the information so we can tell how things are going at various locations, departments and divisions.

09:00.271 --> 09:04.316
We also ask the likeliness of recommendation as an employer.

09:04.617 --> 09:07.020
That's where we get the net promoter score data from.

09:07.827 --> 09:10.991
We also ask about 11 internal services.

09:11.092 --> 09:15.978
So essentially we ask employees how satisfied they are with, say, IT department.

09:15.998 --> 09:17.140
And then we collect that.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.807
So ask a number of favorability questions.

09:21.827 --> 09:26.173
And that's primarily where the information from the agency scorecard comes from.

09:26.593 --> 09:31.921
Questions such as, does your supervisor treat you with respect?

09:32.121 --> 09:33.203
It's those kind of questions.

09:34.004 --> 09:37.108
And then we also have a retention-related question where we have

09:37.578 --> 09:45.045
10 items and we ask the employees to rank them from one to 10 on how important they are for keeping them here as an employee at RTD.

09:45.805 --> 09:51.030
And then finally, we have the open-ended question where they're allowed to free text, whatever they want to tell us.

09:52.251 --> 09:52.671
Next slide.

09:52.711 --> 09:58.476
Here is a brief overview of the survey of the last three years.

09:58.837 --> 10:03.781
So we're at about 32% participation this year down a little bit from last year.

10:03.841 --> 10:06.083
We still have

10:06.248 --> 10:08.571
Pretty good use of the paper survey options.

10:08.591 --> 10:12.755
So about 18% this year chose to use the paper survey over digital.

10:14.818 --> 10:19.443
And again, we stuck with 37 multiple choice questions in one question.

10:21.065 --> 10:21.506
Next slide.

10:23.848 --> 10:27.152
Here's a quick breakout of participation by work unit.

10:27.292 --> 10:30.636
As you can see, bus operations and rail operations makes up

10:30.920 --> 10:36.509
a majority of our respondents, which makes sense as they are the larger groups within our organization.

10:38.493 --> 10:38.954
Next slide.

10:40.837 --> 10:50.413
And finally, here is a breakout of the surveys submitted by various tenure representation status and supervisory status.

10:50.917 --> 10:56.042
10 year, we had very good participation from individuals who have been here for 10 plus years.

10:56.102 --> 11:00.386
That's great to see people still involved and engaged at 10 plus years.

11:01.627 --> 11:13.157
Representation status, this was at 50 split until the last week of the survey and then nonrepresented kind of pulled ahead probably because they were sitting at their computers that last week and took the survey.

11:14.618 --> 11:16.440
And then finally supervisory status.

11:16.460 --> 11:20.704
So while a large percentage is non supervisory,

11:20.971 --> 11:26.158
The upshot of that is we are still getting very good voice from our frontline staff.

11:28.201 --> 11:31.927
Okay.

11:31.947 --> 11:34.690
Good morning, Jake Sudemeyer, Manager of Market Research.

11:35.171 --> 11:37.895
I'll go through the employee net promoter score.

11:38.195 --> 11:49.932
Again, a quick reminder, if you're not familiar with NPS and how it's calculated, when asking employees how likely they are to recommend working RTV friends or family, anyone answering as a nine or 10,

11:50.317 --> 11:52.540
is classified as a promoter.

11:52.900 --> 11:58.608
Any one seven or eight is a passive and then zero through six are considered detractors.

11:58.648 --> 12:06.659
So the score is calculated by just subtracting the percentage of detractors from the promoters gives us our NPS score.

12:06.679 --> 12:12.507
So as you can see in 2024 our NPS was at negative two and this year we are at four.

12:12.787 --> 12:14.009
So we've got an improvement there.

12:15.051 --> 12:16.172
Next slide please.

12:18.498 --> 12:22.727
And again, this shows you the actual percentages of those classifications.

12:22.747 --> 12:30.283
So you can see you take the 35% for promoters, subtract the 31% from the trackers, and gives our overall NPS of four.

12:31.265 --> 12:31.866
Next slide.

12:32.825 --> 12:38.391
All right, for our composite index score, going through the employee ownership composite index score.

12:38.672 --> 12:54.630
Again, this is a average of employee survey scores related to how engaged, supported, safe feeling and understanding of how employees contribute to agency success, look at engagement, supervisor support, resource support, physical safety, safe from crime.

12:55.015 --> 12:56.357
psychological safety.

12:56.838 --> 13:05.149
So I can see the big story here is a 16% increase from the score, from the percentage in 2023 to 2025.

13:06.712 --> 13:13.662
So this is anyone who answered either agree or strongly agree for those categories.

13:14.883 --> 13:16.546
Next slide.

13:16.566 --> 13:18.829
Sorry, we have a new kitten and she is attacking me.

13:20.750 --> 13:25.258
looking at the individual questions from the index itself.

13:25.795 --> 13:34.807
Again, the big story here is the marked improvement year over year from 2023 into 2024 and continued on into 2025.

13:35.668 --> 13:42.316
Probably the biggest story here on this page is at the very bottom looking at feeling safe from crime in the work environment.

13:42.877 --> 13:52.950
From just 45% in 2023 of employees saying they agree or strongly agree that statement to now 70% in 2025.

13:53.470 --> 13:58.176
So even a decent improvement over 2024s as well.

13:59.237 --> 13:59.737
Next slide.

14:02.641 --> 14:06.506
These are the overall composite index scores broken out by tenure.

14:07.387 --> 14:18.600
So if we look at those less than one year, this really is the only instance I believe in this, at least my set in the slide deck, where we actually see 2024 outscoring 2025.

14:18.580 --> 14:27.776
There, you know, we had 88% answering the degree or strongly disagree for their overall composite index to 78 for 2025.

14:27.836 --> 14:30.060
But again, marked improvement year over year.

14:30.120 --> 14:36.371
And then again, looking compared to 2023, pretty substantial improvement.

14:37.653 --> 14:38.394
Next slide.

14:39.256 --> 14:41.179
All right, for employee favorability.

14:41.851 --> 14:56.785
More of the same, again marked improvement year after year every year, and kind of reiterating the employee safety, feeling safe in my work environment, just 64% in 2023, up to 83% now in 2025.

14:58.847 --> 14:59.408
Next slide.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.092
Again, more of the same here.

15:09.137 --> 15:10.018
All right, next.

15:15.652 --> 15:20.039
Again, pretty, I am a jungle gym this morning.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.205
All right, next slide.

15:29.994 --> 15:38.267
Again, the safety perceptions, probably the largest marked improvement out of all the metrics.

15:42.736 --> 15:48.215
And again, looking again now at favorability as opposed to the Kamazza Index score by tenure.

15:48.235 --> 15:54.838
A little bit closer this time, especially amongst those very new to RTB less than a year.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.355
jumping in here just briefly.

15:58.375 --> 16:04.748
This is the curve that I had mentioned in my opening remarks here that we see that there's again this honeymoon period within the first year.

16:04.788 --> 16:13.725
Again, 15% improvement over 2023, but same as last year in the 89% up here and then sort of an evening and out over here.

16:13.766 --> 16:19.577
So starting at 79% for one to three years, going down to 77% for 10 or more years, but you can see this is

16:19.557 --> 16:39.366
roughly within the margin of error all four categories after the first year and in 2023 you could see that that swoop that's starting off and then over time people are generally maybe a little bit less favorable and then a slight increase at the end but this is nice to see the employees across the their tenure are satisfied and more so this year than before.

16:39.427 --> 16:44.434
All right next slide.

16:46.051 --> 16:55.423
So here just to highlight some of the year over year improvements, looking at the statement, I have trust in my departmental managers to make decisions that align with the values of the organization.

16:55.783 --> 16:58.667
You see an 8% increase from last year to this year.

16:59.147 --> 17:04.634
And again, broken out on the right hand side in terms of supervisory status as well as representation.

17:08.139 --> 17:11.463
And again, for I have the resources to successfully perform my duties.

17:11.483 --> 17:15.788
7% increase from last year to this year.

17:20.341 --> 17:26.808
And here highlighting those aspects that had a improvement over 5% from last year.

17:34.037 --> 17:38.602
And now significant meaning 15% or more improvement over the last two years.

17:39.062 --> 17:47.732
A quick note, this does not mean statistical significance, just significance in terms of the percentage of increase from year over year.

17:52.184 --> 17:54.570
All right, next and continuing on.

17:54.610 --> 18:02.329
All right.

18:04.823 --> 18:07.045
and it comes back to me at this point.

18:07.426 --> 18:15.855
So, noting that that market improvement year-over-year, especially over the two-year window, would not be possible without some of the efforts that were put in by staff.

18:15.875 --> 18:18.818
So, those are the strategic initiatives that are developed year-over-year.

18:19.619 --> 18:28.688
Specifically, with respect to the employee survey, those are back-to-basics people, power and welcoming transit environment, the fourth being customer and community connections, which isn't really gauged by the survey.

18:28.668 --> 18:43.812
So moving forward, back to basics in 2023-24, one of the tactics developed was surrounding internal communication and you can see over that two year period there's been a 20% increase in employee responses to the prompt.

18:43.912 --> 18:46.717
I am adequately informed about agency news projects and initiatives.

18:46.757 --> 18:49.461
This is due to some internal communications enhancements.

18:49.660 --> 18:56.147
including changes to the way that we distribute our internal newsletter, crew meetings, things like that.

18:56.187 --> 19:04.355
People are feeling more generally informed all the way from 50% from represented staff up to 67% currently.

19:05.877 --> 19:08.680
Moving into, excuse me, employer retention is next.

19:09.421 --> 19:17.389
We see this wedge here, this pie chart here strongly agree 57% and 27% agree.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.859
that they will be working in RTD one year from now.

19:20.040 --> 19:27.127
Our senior manager of Total Rewards said that this is incredibly, he's coming from the private sector.

19:27.147 --> 19:30.471
He said, I've never seen anything like this in an agency public or otherwise.

19:30.671 --> 19:33.675
So this isn't very good to see.

19:34.556 --> 19:44.467
Moving forward to the top three most important employment and workplace characteristics, we ask folks to rank their top 10, or the 10 that we offer them there.

19:45.147 --> 19:46.549
We're asked to rank

19:46.529 --> 19:54.663
Ranked their top three and you can see the fair compensation 2024 was by far and away the most important work characteristic.

19:54.803 --> 19:56.446
We move forward to 2025.

19:56.886 --> 19:57.407
It's about the same.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.831
It's actually considerably less than the top end.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.137
And then there are some other things that are that have risen in importance, including.

20:03.117 --> 20:08.686
Tools and equipment which is new to this is risen a lot more than that I would have anticipated.

20:09.187 --> 20:14.756
We need to delve into what this means to individual people that could mean a lot of things to 3000 different people.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.581
This could be, you know, wrenches and things to mechanics.

20:17.601 --> 20:22.489
This could mean it equipment for certain people tablets and things.

20:22.509 --> 20:24.653
We'll have to delve into see what that means for folks.

20:24.633 --> 20:27.618
moving into our key driver analysis for 2025.

20:27.698 --> 20:33.527
We've seen that there were two other areas of opportunity in 2024.

20:33.567 --> 20:38.835
Those were, I believe, manageable workloads and professional development opportunities.

20:38.855 --> 20:46.988
Those sort of increased, and so they've fallen out of the areas of opportunity box down at the bottom right-hand corner, just briefly walking through this.

20:47.409 --> 20:50.674
Most of the folks on this meeting have seen this before.

20:51.194 --> 20:56.496
But on this chart here, the higher, the farther along the y-axis.

20:56.729 --> 21:02.718
It goes to the top that indicates higher satisfaction with RTD and RTD services.

21:02.939 --> 21:09.569
And then the higher importance it is to individual employees based on this ranking activity that we asked them to do.

21:10.089 --> 21:15.999
And so we can see that fair compensation is really close to the mean, can still possibly use some improvement.

21:16.059 --> 21:24.171
And maybe this is surrounding employee communication around their compensation or opportunities for them

21:24.505 --> 21:27.668
use their professional development funds and things like that.

21:27.768 --> 21:30.851
So they can use that for their own personal benefit.

21:31.291 --> 21:36.115
And also opportunities for advancement is another area that we'll be taking a look at in 2025-26.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.880
Moving again to the employee security.

21:40.920 --> 21:45.584
As we said before, this has increased 25% over a two-year period.

21:45.604 --> 21:46.645
This is incredible.

21:46.925 --> 21:52.470
This is still the lowest score, the lowest favorable response of all of the survey responses.

21:52.450 --> 22:00.804
We can see a lot of the efforts that have been put into, you know, increasing welcoming transit environment within Union Station and then across the district.

22:01.126 --> 22:02.933
All of these efforts are taking hold.

22:03.638 --> 22:05.380
Again, key takeaways.

22:05.780 --> 22:10.406
We can see that there was a continued favorable response increase.

22:11.046 --> 22:17.053
We can see that the efforts that we've been engaging in to improve some of those scores have really had taken effect.

22:17.454 --> 22:18.815
They've improved those scores.

22:19.916 --> 22:26.464
We see that higher favorability is less influenced by tenure in 2025, noting that flattened curve from year one and beyond.

22:28.066 --> 22:33.612
Talking again about the employee net promoter score versus the employee ownership composite index.

22:34.115 --> 22:57.388
We can see that if I were to go back to the one pager that showed the agency performance scorecard toward the beginning of this presentation, all of those five metrics that we consider to be performance metrics, key performance metrics for this particular strategic priority, we can see that those numbers are moving considerably, but the employee net promoter score is not

22:57.773 --> 22:58.694
raising as much.

22:58.915 --> 23:01.278
So there's less linkage there than we would like.

23:01.378 --> 23:09.911
So I think that that employee composite index may serve as a better success, overall success metric in future years.

23:09.931 --> 23:12.034
And that's something that we had raised in last year.

23:12.074 --> 23:13.196
We're seeing that again this year.

23:13.717 --> 23:18.504
And again, the key driver analysis that I just showed highlights the opportunities for 2025 and 26.

23:18.544 --> 23:23.832
And with that, we have finished the presentation and are open to questions from the board.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.341
Thank you very much.

23:26.521 --> 23:28.644
Are there any questions or comments from the committee?

23:29.546 --> 23:31.428
Director Nicholson, I saw your hand shoot up first.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.693
I try to be quick on the draw.

23:35.334 --> 23:36.655
Thank you for the presentation.

23:36.736 --> 23:37.657
It was wonderful.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.820
I enjoyed reading that over this morning.

23:40.321 --> 23:49.674
I found the distinctions between the different employee types and the represented versus non-represented really interesting.

23:49.734 --> 23:52.738
And I just wanted to ask, can we get

23:52.955 --> 24:07.437
those numbers broken down by the different employee types that you mentioned at the beginning of the spreadsheet because you had a couple of different departments in their bus operations, rail operations, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

24:08.199 --> 24:20.177
I would just be fascinated to look at, not just represented versus non-represented, but among our different types of employees, is there a meaningful difference in

24:20.157 --> 24:30.655
the key drivers of what they're looking for is their difference in, for example, fair compensation being an issue in some departments over others.

24:30.695 --> 24:39.050
So just, is that something that you could provide to board members a bit more granular breakdown of those numbers?

24:40.232 --> 24:40.933
Mr. McKay.

24:41.504 --> 24:42.485
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

24:42.525 --> 24:45.768
I would say that the employees are saying that that is an important factor.

24:45.808 --> 24:47.589
They're not saying that that's an issue right now.

24:47.609 --> 24:51.613
I just want to make that distinction that we ask them to rank there at the most important characteristics.

24:51.633 --> 24:55.076
That's not to say that somebody is disappointed with their current salary.

24:55.096 --> 25:00.982
They're just saying that is an important employment characteristic just to make that draw that specific line.

25:01.002 --> 25:10.930
And as far as more granular data, if you have specific asks about, if you can tell me which one you're interested in the most are a few of them, we can delve into that data.

25:11.051 --> 25:11.511
Thank you.

25:11.980 --> 25:12.320
Awesome.

25:12.341 --> 25:13.122
I'll send you an email.

25:15.285 --> 25:17.748
Madam CEO, I saw your hand go up and then it went down.

25:17.869 --> 25:18.670
Did that get covered?

25:20.072 --> 25:20.592
Yes, it did.

25:20.613 --> 25:34.793
And I was just going to put in a different element as well, recognizing as we talk about this, considering that we do bargain for wages with two thirds of our workforce and considering the time at which this was done, that could be a factor as well.

25:34.833 --> 25:39.640
But Mr. McKay answered the question is best suited, which I believe addressed my concerns as well.

25:39.981 --> 25:41.683
Not my concerns, my response.

25:42.507 --> 25:42.807
Great.

25:43.729 --> 25:44.370
Director Catlin.

25:46.893 --> 25:50.038
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I am a GMCEO Johnson.

25:50.098 --> 25:53.262
I appreciate your context for that.

25:53.723 --> 25:59.291
I just wanted to say I reviewed this over the weekend and I was really encouraged.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.976
I thought the trend was very, very positive.

26:02.996 --> 26:10.927
So I just wanted to say I appreciate the further explanation today, but I just wanted to say that this looked really good.

26:11.027 --> 26:11.468
Thank you.

26:13.169 --> 26:13.690
Mr. McKay.

26:14.771 --> 26:20.097
If you like these results, just wait till you hear the customer and community results on the meeting on the 23rd, just a plug for the next meeting.

26:23.441 --> 26:24.862
Vice Chair Guzman is your turn.

26:26.324 --> 26:28.527
Thank you, Chair Guzman.

26:28.607 --> 26:30.509
Thank you very much for the presentation.

26:30.929 --> 26:37.557
My question, is there any sort of target for the survey participation?

26:40.068 --> 26:42.592
Not a target per se, Mr. Chair, if I may.

26:42.612 --> 26:42.872
Please.

26:43.473 --> 26:44.174
Not a target per se.

26:44.194 --> 26:51.724
We like to see, you know, a couple of years ago, we had a 47 percent rate, and that's incredible.

26:52.646 --> 26:59.976
Jake Studemeyer, who's also on this call, he has said that both private and public sector, 20 to 30 percent is considered good.

27:00.056 --> 27:01.779
So we're over 30 percent.

27:01.879 --> 27:02.860
That's fantastic.

27:02.880 --> 27:07.847
We have heard from people in the open-ended comments at the end that they're feeling a little bit of survey fatigue.

27:08.047 --> 27:16.977
So there is an opportunity perhaps in 2026 to maybe do a smaller scale or just to make sure that we're still hitting the same the same.

27:18.618 --> 27:28.409
Stuff that you know the strategic plan elements as long as we're capturing those things somehow we'll talk about that internally to figure out how best we can we can roll out a different survey next year.

27:30.571 --> 27:31.132
OK, thank you.

27:31.172 --> 27:37.699
Yeah, I mean, I just I feel like 32% a little low and I would love to.

27:38.590 --> 27:52.871
see us somehow, you know, creatively think about how can we improve that number, whether it's like a departmental competition and the department with the highest participation percentage gets a pizza party.

27:53.031 --> 28:01.364
You know, it's something I just, I feel like there's opportunity to improve that even though 30 to, you know, 20, 30% is considered good.

28:02.926 --> 28:03.467
Madam CEO.

28:04.072 --> 28:04.853
Yes, thank you.

28:04.893 --> 28:14.722
I was going to have Mr. Studermeyer expound, but before I do that, recognizing the vice chair's comments, we do have full fledged engagement and recognizing you are talking about incentivizing individuals.

28:15.082 --> 28:25.572
We do give giveaways, we give food, we do a lot of different things and recognizing that the intent behind garnering as much feedback as we can, considering the two thirds of our workforce are out on the front lines.

28:25.632 --> 28:31.598
We intentionally, as Mr. McKay said, do that during the bid selection process with their work shifts.

28:31.578 --> 28:36.383
and recognizing that we want to see a greater representation.

28:36.403 --> 28:53.280
This is statistically valid, and I was just going to offer, and being on a public agency space, this response rate is heading shoulders above the crowd, recognizing that other agencies, and this is from my own experience, working at six other transit agencies beside this one, really is something to applaud.

28:53.840 --> 28:58.345
Mr. Studemeyer, you want to expand referencing the participation rate

28:58.865 --> 28:59.586
Absolutely.

28:59.646 --> 29:00.007
Thank you.

29:00.688 --> 29:06.698
So, again, having nearly a third of our workforce taking the survey is great.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.562
Good is one word to use it.

29:08.822 --> 29:10.305
Getting up close to a third is great.

29:11.527 --> 29:12.789
It's a fine balance.

29:12.809 --> 29:16.315
I understand the want and the desire to have more participation.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.679
Again, more participation is always good.

29:18.659 --> 29:20.301
It is a fine balance, though.

29:21.322 --> 29:26.989
When you start to push for more and more completion, it can drive something similar to the Hawthorne effect.

29:27.250 --> 29:37.362
If anyone's familiar with psychology and research, folks alter their responses when they know they're being watched or being pushed towards something.

29:37.402 --> 29:46.253
So if you're really, really, really heavy on participation, it can actually drive up feelings of paranoia or concern like, why are they wanting so much participation?

29:46.233 --> 29:59.411
So again, not that there isn't more that we can do to encourage participation, but again, it is a very fine balance between encouraging participation and, you know, mandating participation for lack of a better word.

30:03.617 --> 30:04.538
All right, Director Bezek.

30:05.900 --> 30:06.440
Thanks very much.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.522
Thanks for the presentation.

30:07.802 --> 30:15.733
With regard to the participation, my guess without any scientific background is much like Google reviews, right?

30:15.899 --> 30:16.440
I'm happy.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.561
I'm not going to participate.

30:17.821 --> 30:18.502
I'm unhappy.

30:18.562 --> 30:21.065
I'm going on Google and I'm giving you one stock.

30:21.085 --> 30:24.029
So maybe the lack of participation says something.

30:24.149 --> 30:33.060
But overall, I think the improvement that we're seeing over these several years is really all down to GM CEO Johnson and her team.

30:33.801 --> 30:40.629
And I'm not surprised that it takes time because as we all know, when change is implemented, people get there, you know, that people don't like it.

30:41.450 --> 30:43.813
But then as time goes on and they see that the changes are good,

30:44.553 --> 30:47.644
then they realize that it was the right thing to do and they're much happier.

30:47.684 --> 30:50.936
So I think that's what we're seeing here when we look at this over a period of time.

30:50.956 --> 30:54.951
So hats off to you, GM CEO Johnson, thanks for the presentation.

30:58.542 --> 30:59.884
Okay, thank you.

31:00.245 --> 31:14.106
I want to tell you I was happy to see this because safe and happy employees make safe and happy customers in the same way that safe and happy baristas make safe and happy customers at my other job.

31:14.126 --> 31:20.196
So I am excited to see the correlation and what's coming up with customer experience surveys.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.068
in a couple of weeks.

31:22.389 --> 31:28.138
So, gentlemen, thank you, and thank you for keeping the presentation tight so we can move on to other matters.

31:28.498 --> 31:29.179
Thank you so much.

31:30.401 --> 31:34.487
Are there any other matters to discuss before we move into the executive session?

31:36.470 --> 31:37.071
Chair Buque.

31:38.148 --> 31:38.989
Yeah, thank you very much.

31:39.029 --> 31:39.730
Share Guzman.

31:40.491 --> 31:42.614
I just wanted to take this moment real quick.

31:43.655 --> 31:47.820
Yesterday, there appeared to be an anti-Semitic attack that occurred in Boulder.

31:48.882 --> 31:59.515
I just want to say that the heart of this agency, the heart of this board go out to you, Director Geisinger, your constituents, Boulder community,

31:59.495 --> 32:04.501
the Jewish community not only here in Colorado, but the Jewish community is all across the world.

32:05.322 --> 32:19.118
So I just wanted to acknowledge that as an agency that, again, as we mentioned during our executive committee a couple of weeks ago, you can't fight hate with hate.

32:19.639 --> 32:23.583
Love always wins in the long run and that this agency's heart is with all of you.

32:23.904 --> 32:24.304
Thank you.

32:29.667 --> 32:30.047
Thank you.

32:34.773 --> 32:36.435
Sorry, I have to hold space for a minute.

32:37.436 --> 32:38.938
Are there any other matters to discuss?

32:42.121 --> 32:42.402
All right.

32:43.102 --> 32:48.489
As a reminder, our next meeting will be Monday, June 23rd at 830 a.m.

32:48.849 --> 32:53.194
At that meeting, we are set to discuss the results of our customer and community surveys.

32:56.347 --> 33:10.182
In a moment, the committee will meet in executive session to further our dialogue with the general manager CEO regarding her performance in meeting the agency values for and based off duties and the progress towards her 2025 short term goals.

33:11.264 --> 33:18.692
I would like to append the motion to move into executive session to state that the performance committee will be deemed adjourned.

33:19.195 --> 33:21.179
after it adjourns into the executive session.

33:21.700 --> 33:27.954
For public transparency, this means that once the committee moves into executive session, the main meeting will be adjourned.

33:28.755 --> 33:32.884
I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following.

33:33.792 --> 33:47.553
pursuant to Section 24-6-402, Open Paran-4, Close Paran, Open Paran-F, Close Paran, Open Paran-I, Close Paran of the Colorado Revised Statutes.

33:48.014 --> 33:52.240
For consideration of personnel matters regarding the Board's dialogue

33:52.220 --> 34:04.452
with the general manager and CEO on her performance in meeting the agency values core based job duties and progress towards her 2025 short term goals and input from the board of directors on the same.

34:04.492 --> 34:06.954
Do I have a motion?

34:07.555 --> 34:08.296
Music.

34:09.477 --> 34:09.777
Second.

34:11.298 --> 34:14.141
I have music as the movement and Caitlin as the second.

34:15.262 --> 34:18.025
Are there any no votes on this action?

34:22.038 --> 34:26.264
Seeing none, then our regular session is adjourned at 904am.

34:26.665 --> 34:30.611
Directors, please move over to the executive session.

34:30.871 --> 34:31.953
Oh, sorry, Melanie.

34:33.075 --> 34:38.603
Okay, please move over to the executive session and allow a few minutes for everybody to move over.

34:38.943 --> 34:39.304
Thank you.

      "[971.73\u2013978.08] SPEAKER_02: I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.",
      "[980.16\u2013985.61] SPEAKER_02: We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.",
      "[986.67\u2013989.72] SPEAKER_02: There are commuter routes and I",
      "[989.7\u2013998.22] SPEAKER_02: would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.",
      "[998.27\u20131004.69] SPEAKER_02: So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.",
      "[1004.73\u20131006.29] SPEAKER_02: Otherwise, Peggy has like",
      "[1006.96\u20131010.69] SPEAKER_02: two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.",
      "[1010.71\u20131013.84] SPEAKER_02: There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.",
      "[1014.82\u20131022.05] SPEAKER_02: I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of",
      "[1022.67\u20131031.73] SPEAKER_02: you know, not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.",
      "[1032.53\u20131042.49] SPEAKER_02: The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, you know, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.",
      "[1042.47\u20131051.49] SPEAKER_02: You know, I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in Peggy's district or yours exactly.",
      "[1051.51\u20131053.02] SPEAKER_02: And so.",
      "[1053.64\u20131058.55] SPEAKER_02: But creating a system where the trip cap is 40 bucks doesn't work for me.",
      "[1058.66\u20131064.07] SPEAKER_02: Creating a trip cap where it's 15 bucks doesn't work for the people in her district.",
      "[1064.15\u20131075.81] SPEAKER_02: It strikes me that the right approach would be to have different levels of financial cap and different levels of trip cap to go along with them and let people pick.",

      "[1079.67\u20131079.91] SPEAKER_02: Great.",

      "[1086.57\u20131087.67] SPEAKER_02: Depends on where you live.",
      "[1087.69\u20131089.63] SPEAKER_02: Depends on the types of trips you're going to be taking.",
      "[1089.69\u20131099.69] SPEAKER_02: But making people all fit into one size is either going to leave her people paying $20 for every single trip that they take.",
      "[1099.67\u20131108.77] SPEAKER_02: or it's going to put people in my district in a reduced number of rides because very few trips are going to cost $20 or $25.",
      "[1109.03\u20131111.08] SPEAKER_02: So those are my two pieces of feedback.",
      "[1111.1\u20131111.4] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.",

      "[1139.14\u20131145.53] SPEAKER_17: And because of our OSS meeting went so long,",
      "[1145.51\u20131152.03] SPEAKER_17: we weren't able to get to through the discussion and that also I think impacted our ability to have some interim discussions.",
      "[1152.07\u20131175.34] SPEAKER_17: So I just want folks to you know keep keep an open mind to what staff is saying and definitely share that feedback because we're on a timeline but also just recognize that well and please if I'm saying the strong introduction but what is being presented is a concept framework and so we want so we'll get more feedback and then of course staff is going to be working very closely",
      "[1175.66\u20131183.09] SPEAKER_17: with our existing customers and advocacy organizations to make further refinements and give us some more stuff to look at.",

      "[1191.03\u20131203.53] SPEAKER_17: And I'm also listening and taking notes and I know staff is, so I would just urge if anyone has thoughts one way or another, please share them tonight since we are also on",
      "[1203.81\u20131207.76] SPEAKER_17: timeline with our existing partners and those contracts as well.",

      "[1219.74\u20131223.25] SPEAKER_06: So I saw I seen one of those slot these slides that it says there's",
      "[1223.54\u20131232.07] SPEAKER_06: In December of 2024, there were about 2,900 total active customers of access on demand.",
      "[1233.13\u20131238.29] SPEAKER_06: So there were 2,900 people, roughly, who used it in all of December.",
      "[1239.07\u20131239.57] SPEAKER_06: Is that right?",
      "[1240.91\u20131243.52] SPEAKER_20: I know that would be for the year, I believe.",
      "[1244.6\u20131245.28] SPEAKER_06: Let me just.",
      "[1245.42\u20131245.94] SPEAKER_06: OK.",
      "[1245.96\u20131250.95] SPEAKER_06: So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year.",
      "[1251.23\u20131251.69] SPEAKER_06: That's it.",
      "[1252.58\u20131265.27] SPEAKER_06: And so I guess what I'm trying to just understand is, if we were going to spend, say, $10 million or $15 million on 2,900 people,",
      "[1265.74\u20131270.81] SPEAKER_06: What do we think the equivalent is for just our regular riders?",
      "[1271.11\u20131272.05] SPEAKER_06: Do we have any guess?",
      "[1272.67\u20131275.03] SPEAKER_06: I mean, I know people have different ridership.",
      "[1275.07\u20131289.43] SPEAKER_06: If we have a million customers a year and it's the majority of our budget, I'm just trying to get a sense of how the per-person spend for a regular rider compares to the per-person spend for access on demand.",
      "[1291.71\u20131293.76] SPEAKER_20: Go ahead, Deborah.",
      "[1295.54\u20131299.05] SPEAKER_16: So if I can, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question.",
      "[1299.31\u20131301.75] SPEAKER_16: I would not want us to conjecture and speculate.",
      "[1301.81\u20131303.62] SPEAKER_16: We could double back and give you those numbers.",
      "[1304.52\u20131310.25] SPEAKER_16: As we talk about, you use the term regular writer, you're talking about those that are using fixed route service.",
      "[1310.27\u20131313.41] SPEAKER_16: I just want to be clear and intentional with the language we're using going forward.",
      "[1313.39\u20131322.19] SPEAKER_16: So we need to assess that because it's a different level of service because with fixed route bus, we're not providing curb to curb service.",
      "[1322.53\u20131326.45] SPEAKER_16: And so we can double back and share that information with the board.",
      "[1327.39\u20131331.52] SPEAKER_16: But I think it wouldn't be fruitful for us to guesstimate because this is critically important.",
      "[1331.88\u20131337.39] SPEAKER_16: But as we come back and we have some guidance, we could provide that detailed information, if you will.",
      "[1337.79\u20131338.13] SPEAKER_16: Thank you.",
      "[1340.11\u20131341.17] SPEAKER_16: Thank you.",
      "[1342.51\u20131344.59] SPEAKER_10: Any other directors comments?",
      "[1344.61\u20131345.41] SPEAKER_09: Yeah, director Guzman.",
      "[1346.35\u20131353.88] SPEAKER_05: So I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area.",
      "[1356.37\u20131360.31] SPEAKER_05: District C is fairly blessed with",
      "[1360.71\u20131369.69] SPEAKER_05: multiple forms of transit and fixed route, where this is not a particular problem, but it is an issue in the suburban areas of the region.",
      "[1370.13\u20131383.77] SPEAKER_05: And it is highly concerning that we would restrict it so much where people would be left off of the system that live within a quarter mile of a commuter bus and still not be able to access this.",
      "[1386.26\u20131398.6] SPEAKER_05: I also think that as we proceed into the future after the demographers presentation to the finance and planning committee, a big concern will be our aging population in the region.",
      "[1399.48\u20131404.62] SPEAKER_05: And it's a, you know, somebody said that this is a drop in the bucket for our budget.",
      "[1405.85\u20131416.12] SPEAKER_05: Maybe right now, but eventually this is going to catch up with us, which is why we're having this conversation and access on demand and folks that are able to",
      "[1416.45\u20131430.93] SPEAKER_05: or out of need, utilize this system, need to be considered as humans first and how we serve them, which is our mission, right?",
      "[1430.95\u20131432.64] SPEAKER_05: They need connection as well.",
      "[1433.11\u20131446.55] SPEAKER_05: and not every one of them will be able to jump from a, jump, roll, walk, shuffle to a fixed route form of transportation to get them to their destinations.",
      "[1447.51\u20131454.08] SPEAKER_05: I have a question about the time on this, right?",
      "[1454.54\u20131459.35] SPEAKER_05: If it's mirroring regular service provision for the whole region,",
      "[1460.58\u20131468.37] SPEAKER_05: It kind of makes sense, but I would still be concerned for the reasons that emergencies don't happen on RTD schedule.",
      "[1469.37\u20131478.38] SPEAKER_05: And so somebody who already has a specific need for this type of transportation usage might need to go to the doctor.",
      "[1478.92\u20131481.61] SPEAKER_05: And what do they do if they're unable to drive?",
      "[1482.13\u20131492.69] SPEAKER_05: And regular bus service is not something that they can use because the buses aren't running a two o'clock in the morning emergency room visit is not unheard of and not uncommon in anybody's life.",
      "[1493.25\u20131496.01] SPEAKER_05: And yet what do we do to take care of those that are most vulnerable.",
      "[1497.4\u20131500.64] SPEAKER_05: So for me, I would really want to see some clarity around",
      "[1501.03\u20131502.05] SPEAKER_05: those two areas.",
      "[1503.19\u20131508.7] SPEAKER_05: I am frankly less concerned about minimal difference of cost savings.",
      "[1509.62\u20131512.14] SPEAKER_05: I mean, we're talking $5 million.",
      "[1512.18\u20131518.3] SPEAKER_05: That's not really the top priority for me on that part.",
      "[1518.68\u20131543.56] SPEAKER_05: right now it will eventually get there because this will likely continue to grow but I do want to make sure that we are basing ourselves in reality to serve the taxpayers needs and this is a need right this is not a desire as some of the other services we want to grow and create are this one is an actual need and so I want to be clear in my language on that and why I'm",
      "[1544.57\u20131546.91] SPEAKER_05: depositing these comments within that framework.",
      "[1547.26\u20131548.48] SPEAKER_05: So that would be my feedback.",
      "[1548.5\u20131552.99] SPEAKER_05: I'd like to see something a little bit different on those two things, the service area and the time for service.",
      "[1553.17\u20131553.48] SPEAKER_05: Thank you.",
      "[1554.06\u20131554.76] SPEAKER_05: Thank you, Director.",

      "[1559.44\u20131561.75] SPEAKER_04: I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you just said.",
      "[1561.77\u20131571.16] SPEAKER_04: I represent Arvada, and Arvada is actually the fastest growing aging population.",
      "[1571.36\u20131572.56] SPEAKER_04: However, I said that.",
      "[1572.64\u20131573.51] SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure I said it right.",
      "[1574.17\u20131579.64] SPEAKER_04: And a lot of our service is not in the areas where we have those aging people.",
      "[1580.2\u20131582.84] SPEAKER_04: So I'd really like to see",
      "[1583.39\u20131585.44] SPEAKER_04: just the boundary kept the same.",
      "[1585.56\u20131590.48] SPEAKER_04: I'm also really again with director Guzman keeping it as a full 24 seven.",
      "[1590.5\u20131606.9] SPEAKER_04: I just like I have a friend in a wheelchair and I just think about her trying like if she didn't live where she lived if she lived where I live she would have such a difficult time getting you know around her community and I won't just",
      "[1607.41\u20131612.9] SPEAKER_04: especially like if the service is outside of that time period, it's just precluding her life.",
      "[1612.96\u20131624.1] SPEAKER_04: And I know we don't all have these, the same abilities when we're riding the bus, but for a person with disability that's blind or in a wheelchair, I think that we can sort of extend them the grace that they deserve.",
      "[1625.01\u20131627.45] SPEAKER_04: I also would like to see the cap stay at 60.",
      "[1627.61\u20131640.82] SPEAKER_04: I think that, again, I know that it's a, you know, less than 10% of the population go above the 50 rides, but I think it's still like that's, we're giving them access to a free and full life.",
      "[1641.88\u20131650.07] SPEAKER_04: And I think if we are gonna go with the 650, I think that that to me is fine, but I also think that it would be imperative that we really,",
      "[1650.05\u20131677.56] SPEAKER_04: put out the live program and let let those writers know That there is another option like there's always with someone the other day she Lives about three miles away from where she works and you know She can afford it, but just barely and she didn't know about the live program So I think that there's we're missing an opportunity there specifically with these With these writers so and then my last one is just a request is it possible to get a map of",
      "[1677.54\u20131692.32] SPEAKER_04: like sort of like a density map of where AOD is like highly being used to sort of go with that, like thinking about, you know, West Jefferson County versus central Denver, just kind of see what that looks like.",
      "[1692.42\u20131699.61] SPEAKER_04: Obviously we want to anonymize the data, but I think it's sort of just would be interesting for us to know where the sort of hotspots of usage are.",

      "[1799.68\u20131810.56] SPEAKER_17: So one of the things that I urge is that if we put an offer on the table, so to speak, we don't take it back.",
      "[1810.96\u20131812.6] SPEAKER_17: That's kind of our baseline now.",
      "[1813.36\u20131818.55] SPEAKER_17: And another piece of feedback I had is that where something is not",
      "[1820.34\u20131832.9] SPEAKER_17: For every change we make, which essentially results in a reduction of a service of some kind or an increase in price, we really have to justify that line by line.",
      "[1833.28\u20131841.73] SPEAKER_17: So for example, if we decide that we are going to strictly align with service hours, then we have to justify it.",
      "[1841.89\u20131843.23] SPEAKER_17: It doesn't cost us any more money.",
      "[1843.39\u20131844.41] SPEAKER_17: It's not going to save us a penny.",
      "[1844.86\u20131848.2] SPEAKER_17: If somebody, you know, uses on demand,",
      "[1849.01\u20131853.46] SPEAKER_17: 15 or 20 minutes or an hour before fixed drought starts.",
      "[1855.1\u20131860.01] SPEAKER_17: Likewise, it's not costing us that I could see a lot of money, if any.",
      "[1860.41\u20131864.88] SPEAKER_17: for us to offer service outside of our general service area.",
      "[1865.96\u20131868.86] SPEAKER_17: I know that was flagged in the peer review.",
      "[1869.18\u20131888.16] SPEAKER_17: So I, because this idea has been on the table for so many months, I also want to caution us about the service area idea because if we restrict the service, that means there are people who currently are using AOD and they're going to lose it.",
      "[1888.88\u20131889.33] SPEAKER_17: So",
      "[1890.27\u20131900.96] SPEAKER_17: I, um, so that was just, I mean, that was just the, the kind of like high level, like, um, theme that I had in, in the feedback.",
      "[1901.6\u20131914.84] SPEAKER_17: Um, and also, you know, I'm going back to the, uh, initial like a fair, um, we also want to be really careful about what we think.",
      "[1915.19\u20131918.38] SPEAKER_17: is inexpensive because it's really relative.",
      "[1918.42\u20131937.89] SPEAKER_17: So for some folks using the service and they have like a fixed income or very limited income, if we even do you know 450 which would be parity with excess ride and I think I could accept that but like say we go up to 650 or we do this tiered system",
      "[1938.44\u20131946.85] SPEAKER_17: then for some folks, they are not going to be able to write or they're going to be choosing, do I get to the doctor or do I buy food for tonight?",
      "[1947.01\u20131950.72] SPEAKER_17: So I just wanted to put that out there.",
      "[1951.12\u20131960.91] SPEAKER_17: And finally, well, actually, I'll stop there.",
      "[1960.93\u20131968.33] SPEAKER_17: I concurred with what a lot of other directors said in terms of keeping the program as is as much as we can.",
      "[1969.02\u20131981.23] SPEAKER_17: I think that, but I also just want to commend staff, you know, because we are at a much different place than where we were several months ago.",
      "[1981.87\u20131983.67] SPEAKER_17: This is a totally different conversation.",
      "[1984.4\u20131985.96] SPEAKER_17: really slashing this program.",
      "[1986.74\u20131992.2] SPEAKER_17: And staff did a lot of work and we spent several months, we almost voted on this a few months ago.",
      "[1992.24\u20132001.11] SPEAKER_17: And they listened to us as directors and they listened to community because as you know, we've had hundreds of public comments over several months on this.",
      "[2001.75\u20132009.62] SPEAKER_17: And they said, okay, we can take a timeout, we can reassess, we can get some different data, we can, you know, kind of present a new paradigm.",
      "[2009.64\u20132013.44] SPEAKER_17: So again, what's before us today is a sketch of ideas, the feedback is good.",
      "[2013.69\u20132018.73] SPEAKER_17: But I really do want to commend staff for listening and working with us in partnership.",

      "[3120.54\u20133126.31] SPEAKER_16: to bolster the frequency and availability of transit services in the metro area.",
      "[3128.34\u20133141.38] SPEAKER_16: From RTD's perspective, questions were posed relative to how that $420 million figure was derived and they explained how that came about with the work they had done with the third party entity.",

      "[3147.11\u20133162.98] SPEAKER_16: And then we talked about the agency's focus, which all of you are very well aware that we are laser focused on asset renewal, state of good repair, and rightsizing transit service and alignment with RTD's branded comprehensive operational analysis being the system optimization plan.",

      "[3205.48\u20133214.31] SPEAKER_16: It's police department, the downtown Denver partnerships, Sage hospitality, the lower Denver neighborhood association, as well as several local businesses and downtown Denver residents.",
      "[3214.85\u20133221.12] SPEAKER_16: Fair enforcement has also increased in recent months, which is the result of RTDs growing ranks of sworn police officers",
      "[3221.43\u20133236.09] SPEAKER_16: haven't been trained to perform this function alongside the contracted team that we have in security with Allied Universal personnel who had primarily been responsible for this responsibility.",

      "[3251.44\u20133272.23] SPEAKER_16: On a related note, the agency has proactively increased its transit police officer presence at Denver Union Station and across the agency's downtown Denver sector to support the personal safety and security of customers and visitors attending major events and activity, notably as we know, while we're no longer in the hockey playoffs and NBA, but",
      "[3272.7\u20133276.89] SPEAKER_16: people had a welcoming experience in and around our facilities.",
      "[3277.33\u20133288.9] SPEAKER_16: And RTD PD had increased patrols at Denver Union Station and bus stops and rail stations, the high of, before the high profile events, which included the playoff games I just referenced.",

      "[3338.56\u20133348.25] SPEAKER_16: The final speed restriction, which was approximately 400 feet in southbound segment north of south more station and was removed after crews completed those repairs.",
      "[3350.98\u20133360.05] SPEAKER_16: Keeping in mind those rigorous restrictions were put into place due to the fact that we enhanced our inspections of track",
      "[3360.45\u20133365.92] SPEAKER_16: back in May 2024 as an enhanced focus on maintaining the agency's assets and a state of good repair.",
      "[3366.42\u20133370.18] SPEAKER_16: At the time, you know, crews found several minor issues and track imperfections.",

      "[3388.68\u20133403.23] SPEAKER_16: I would be remiss if I didn't state that while this is a cost to celebrate, I shared previously as we look at our infrastructure and it continues to age, this will be par for the course, but since we're ahead of where we were before, we will see less of an impact, I'm certain.",
      "[3404.05\u20133411.82] SPEAKER_16: And last, but certainly not least, I'm pleased to welcome RTD's new Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who's in the audience, she's given a wave.",

      "[4663.8\u20134665.04] SPEAKER_19: We'll see how things go.",
      "[4665.08\u20134666.16] SPEAKER_19: They're short.",
      "[4667.17\u20134669.67] SPEAKER_19: The first one, well, let me give you a little bit of background.",
      "[4669.77\u20134670.64] SPEAKER_19: Okay.",
      "[4670.66\u20134675.71] SPEAKER_19: So the background is I met with my four cities back in February and March.",
      "[4675.69\u20134680.19] SPEAKER_19: And of course, you meet with them and you say hi and you say, okay, what are your needs?",
      "[4680.27\u20134681.09] SPEAKER_19: What are your wants?",
      "[4682.15\u20134691.94] SPEAKER_19: I met with all of them and they all gave me a list of basically trying to restore service that was removed during the pandemic.",
      "[4691.96\u20134702.53] SPEAKER_19: And so, of course, as my job as director, I'm trying to work with our staff to try to get that service restored.",
      "[4703.37\u20134703.97] SPEAKER_19: And so,",
      "[4705.73\u20134729.37] SPEAKER_19: One of my questions or issues is I am guessing that when the RTD Board had to make the hard decisions of how to cut service almost in half because of this highly unusual pandemic, perhaps some of these cuts were not done equally across all 15 districts.",
      "[4729.59\u20134734.77] SPEAKER_10: Director Banker, I'm sorry to interrupt, just so that we keep in order, could we get a second on?",
      "[4735.15\u20134736.84] SPEAKER_10: Could you read the motion and then we get a second?",
      "[4736.86\u20134750.38] SPEAKER_19: Yes, the motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact from 10% to 20% as it relates to major service changes and consistent with the FTA circular 4702.1B.",
      "[4752.02\u20134758.43] SPEAKER_19: And I believe the version that will be voted on is actually the version that",
      "[4759.0\u20134760.84] SPEAKER_19: Mr. Kroll put up for us.",
      "[4761.92\u20134764.15] SPEAKER_10: So that's, that's the language right there.",
      "[4764.19\u20134771.52] SPEAKER_10: The first motion is to move the move to amend the 2025, 2028 title six program update, such that the threshold for triggering either.",
      "[4771.98\u20134780.09] SPEAKER_10: Disappointed Burton or disparate in that fine late night, finding a rising from a major service change from 10% to 20%.",
      "[4781.77\u20134782.59] SPEAKER_10: Do I have a second?",
      "[4783.07\u20134783.43] SPEAKER_10: Second.",
      "[4783.45\u20134785.57] SPEAKER_10: Pagliari is the second.",
      "[4786.46\u20134786.8] SPEAKER_19: Thank you.",
      "[4787.64\u20134794.12] SPEAKER_19: So just to continue a little bit more background and then we can start, I guess, the debate here.",
      "[4795.07\u20134802.11] SPEAKER_19: I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during the pandemic.",
      "[4802.94\u20134817.48] SPEAKER_19: And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations come out.",
      "[4817.45\u20134832.29] SPEAKER_19: I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic and perhaps do it a little bit quicker and",
      "[4833.6\u20134837.79] SPEAKER_19: and also try to make it not quite so difficult.",
      "[4838.22\u20134849.54] SPEAKER_19: So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the city and county of Broomfield, and their transportation staff went through",
      "[4849.52\u20134857.47] SPEAKER_19: our items quite closely and they sent us all a letter with recommended changes.",
      "[4858.21\u20134868.02] SPEAKER_19: So I've gone through with their changes and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the board, see what your thoughts are.",
      "[4868.64\u20134871.23] SPEAKER_19: You know, hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see what happens.",
      "[4871.67\u20134877.53] SPEAKER_19: But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that",
      "[4877.51\u20134886.84] SPEAKER_19: the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large transit agencies.",
      "[4887.52\u20134892.99] SPEAKER_19: And so I did send you also a copy of the city and county of Broomfields letter just to refresh your memory.",
      "[4893.99\u20134901.16] SPEAKER_19: And so I would like to put forth that the first amendment would be changing the threshold from 10% to 20%.",
      "[4901.18\u20134902.66] SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Treasurer Baker.",
      "[4902.8\u20134905.65] SPEAKER_10: So again, the discussion right now is on the motion",
      "[4906.32\u20134908.64] SPEAKER_10: This first motion, the first amendment.",
      "[4908.98\u20134909.81] SPEAKER_10: Director Catlin.",
      "[4913.41\u20134914.31] SPEAKER_11: Thank you, Mr. Chair.",
      "[4914.93\u20134917.76] SPEAKER_11: I'd like to ask GM CEO Johnson.",
      "[4918.54\u20134931.42] SPEAKER_11: I heard from someone I don't remember now because it's getting late, but someone said that some of those assumptions made by City and County Broomfield were incorrect.",
      "[4931.48\u20134931.62] SPEAKER_10: Ms.",
      "[4931.66\u20134932.02] SPEAKER_10: Johnson.",
      "[4932.31\u20134933.43] SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you very much.",
      "[4934.13\u20134952.61] SPEAKER_16: Relative to the comments that were made, and thank you very much, Director Catlin, as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned being part of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in Greater Seattle and then Chicago Transit Authority.",
      "[4954.39\u20134959.19] SPEAKER_16: That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there,",
      "[4959.66\u20134963.02] SPEAKER_16: This is not correct relative to where we sit.",
      "[4963.48\u20134970.93] SPEAKER_16: And more specifically, I do know our director of civil rights when we were going through this quite naturally in the role that he is in.",
      "[4970.99\u20134976.02] SPEAKER_16: He and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies.",
      "[4976.04\u20134981.36] SPEAKER_16: So that's the communique that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving this information.",
      "[4981.6\u20134986.21] SPEAKER_16: So Mr. Green, if you want to just expound succinctly and briefly.",
      "[4986.66\u20134992.25] SPEAKER_01: Yes, thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson, to expand upon the response.",
      "[4992.29\u20135001.74] SPEAKER_01: I just also want to ground us in first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes.",
      "[5002.38\u20135009.53] SPEAKER_01: And in doing that audit, we looked at 22, rather 23 different organizations, which includes the four.",
      "[5009.51\u20135013.69] SPEAKER_01: Marta, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority.",
      "[5014.23\u20135025.43] SPEAKER_01: And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right?",
      "[5025.63\u20135027.57] SPEAKER_01: And ours is stacked in the middle.",
      "[5027.61\u20135029.53] SPEAKER_01: So I want to give you some numbers here.",
      "[5030.29\u20135032.82] SPEAKER_01: So for the four that I just mentioned,",
      "[5033.91\u20135042.6] SPEAKER_01: Marta has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%.",
      "[5043.62\u20135054.64] SPEAKER_01: And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, six out of that 23 have 5% or less, two have 8%,",
      "[5054.97\u20135063.93] SPEAKER_01: six, which includes us, or seven, including us, is at 10%, three at 15%, and then three at 20%.",
      "[5064.15\u20135070.8] SPEAKER_01: And in my over eight years of doing this work, and I'll just say that",
      "[5070.78\u20135082.88] SPEAKER_01: When you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve, specifically with Title VI.",
      "[5083.46\u20135089.11] SPEAKER_01: Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service.",
      "[5089.82\u20135097.15] SPEAKER_01: There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth.",
      "[5097.67\u20135109.14] SPEAKER_01: This is just a mechanism for the agency, such as RTD and the board of directors, so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant.",
      "[5109.16\u20135117.33] SPEAKER_01: So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.",
      "[5119.35\u20135121.71] SPEAKER_08: I've director Ruchin next.",
      "[5126.58\u20135131.23] SPEAKER_17: Um, I did have a question, but I also, um, treasure banker had her hand up and it was her motion.",
      "[5131.33\u20135133.61] SPEAKER_17: So I'm happy to, to wait if that was in response.",
      "[5134.39\u20135134.97] SPEAKER_08: Treasure banker.",
      "[5136.34\u20135142.26] SPEAKER_19: Um, I, I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic.",
      "[5143.23\u20135146.47] SPEAKER_19: So how can we restore",
      "[5147.75\u20135152.4] SPEAKER_19: let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several years ago.",
      "[5152.84\u20135160.65] SPEAKER_19: How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had that service?",
      "[5161.54\u20135164.66] SPEAKER_19: And so now we're being told",
      "[5164.64\u20135173.77] SPEAKER_19: that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to have it.",
      "[5174.93\u20135182.06] SPEAKER_19: And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to pre-pandemic levels?",
      "[5183.4\u20135183.56] SPEAKER_08: Ms.",
      "[5183.58\u20135183.96] SPEAKER_08: Johnson.",
      "[5184.26\u20135185.89] SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you very much, Director Banker.",
      "[5185.93\u20135187.51] SPEAKER_16: That question is better suited for me.",
      "[5187.55\u20135191.81] SPEAKER_16: Relative to the service delivery framework that we have,",
      "[5192.1\u20135210.8] SPEAKER_16: While Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy service is based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours, but more specifically at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP.",
      "[5211.44\u20135217.67] SPEAKER_16: When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were.",
      "[5218.32\u20135220.78] SPEAKER_16: 85% of what service levels were in 2019.",
      "[5221.55\u20135230.72] SPEAKER_16: We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward.",
      "[5231.78\u20135236.97] SPEAKER_16: What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious",
      "[5237.39\u20135241.8] SPEAKER_16: and how we're applying service because we do want to ensure there's equity.",
      "[5241.84\u20135248.37] SPEAKER_16: I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well.",
      "[5248.81\u20135259.33] SPEAKER_16: As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change.",
      "[5259.66\u20135282.41] SPEAKER_16: That is up to the board quite naturally, but I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service keeping in mind that all transit agencies across, you know, the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power.",
      "[5283.14\u20135288.48] SPEAKER_16: Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio.",
      "[5288.59\u20135298.58] SPEAKER_16: What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio.",
      "[5298.92\u20135306.25] SPEAKER_16: We've deviated from that and have a waiver and we're right sizing the fleet as we move forward.",
      "[5306.29\u20135312.32] SPEAKER_16: So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory or were.",
      "[5312.5\u20135313.94] SPEAKER_16: And we're coming back from that.",
      "[5314.92\u20135327.19] SPEAKER_16: We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area from an origin and destination vantage point just by virtue of how our service area is going forward.",
      "[5327.69\u20135331.03] SPEAKER_16: So I'm not providing this to say I don't.",
      "[5331.01\u20135333.25] SPEAKER_16: understand what you're trying to do.",
      "[5333.27\u20135338.96] SPEAKER_16: And as I share it with you, I do clearly and we want to work within the frameworks that we have.",
      "[5339.6\u20135345.43] SPEAKER_16: But a whole cell of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible.",
      "[5345.51\u20135353.58] SPEAKER_16: And I say it from the vantage point of, we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour.",
      "[5354.03\u20135355.55] SPEAKER_16: but that was out on the street.",
      "[5355.85\u20135359.32] SPEAKER_16: Does that really yield the return on investment going forward?",
      "[5359.42\u20135366.97] SPEAKER_16: Hence, that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services going forward.",
      "[5367.39\u20135368.85] SPEAKER_19: Okay, but if I can.",
      "[5368.99\u20135370.93] SPEAKER_19: Treasure, yeah.",
      "[5371.01\u20135375.02] SPEAKER_19: Some of the issues that you just raised are important.",
      "[5375.19\u20135375.82] SPEAKER_19: There's no doubt.",
      "[5376.16\u20135380.42] SPEAKER_19: However, I don't believe it goes to the equity calculation.",
      "[5382.88\u20135383.02] SPEAKER_19: I",
      "[5385.08\u20135400.76] SPEAKER_19: What I think is important to to hear from staff and I know we're going to be talking about this in our retreat, which is I'm looking forward to that is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in three years.",
      "[5401.43\u20135420.99] SPEAKER_19: what barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110, and start quickly, or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher service levels.",
      "[5422.96\u20135423.12] SPEAKER_16: Ms.",
      "[5423.16\u20135423.5] SPEAKER_16: Johnson.",
      "[5423.78\u20135424.18] SPEAKER_16: Thank you.",
      "[5424.2\u20135427.64] SPEAKER_16: There's a couple of external factors that play into that.",
      "[5427.99\u20135434.93] SPEAKER_16: quite naturally when we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate and the lack of people commuting in.",
      "[5435.43\u20135447.31] SPEAKER_16: It's important to keep in mind that there was, I'm forgetting the name, but the city and county of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the occupancy levels.",
      "[5447.57\u20135451.54] SPEAKER_16: But more specifically, what's important to note is that",
      "[5451.52\u20135456.73] SPEAKER_16: there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to this central business district.",
      "[5457.95\u20135468.39] SPEAKER_16: I believe the last time I looked at stats, city and county at Denver was in the bottom three out of out of 50 major cities.",
      "[5468.83\u20135472.49] SPEAKER_16: And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number",
      "[5474.08\u20135478.92] SPEAKER_16: is the third state relative to remote work and then City of Boulder is number one.",
      "[5479.34\u20135487.09] SPEAKER_16: While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic.",
      "[5487.45\u20135496.88] SPEAKER_16: How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before?",
      "[5497.56\u20135501.49] SPEAKER_16: I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward",
      "[5501.84\u20135525.37] SPEAKER_16: relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery.",
      "[5525.89\u20135528.96] SPEAKER_16: And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power,",
      "[5529.26\u20135553.59] SPEAKER_16: we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available where people whereby were working extra shifts and then we didn't have enough people for daily pullout on those other routes.",
      "[5554.01\u20135557.61] SPEAKER_16: And so I'm providing that context to say",
      "[5557.93\u20135577.93] SPEAKER_16: to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do, but to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of this agency's.",
      "[5580.02\u20135580.44] SPEAKER_17: Thanks, sir.",
      "[5580.48\u20135583.86] SPEAKER_17: So I have a question for legal.",
      "[5585.28\u20135595.48] SPEAKER_17: So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I want to be careful of my words.",
      "[5597.3\u20135608.19] SPEAKER_17: Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public comment process or",
      "[5608.74\u20135613.91] SPEAKER_17: Is that something that we, I guess, I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area.",
      "[5613.99\u20135616.13] SPEAKER_17: And I wanted to get a bit of feedback on that.",
      "[5616.59\u20135621.22] SPEAKER_17: Now, to disparage the motion, I just also want to understand the potential legal implications.",
      "[5626.32\u20135628.69] SPEAKER_16: I will address that question.",
      "[5629.23\u20135631.89] SPEAKER_16: And then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound.",
      "[5631.99\u20135635.03] SPEAKER_16: I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement,",
      "[5635.61\u20135659.39] SPEAKER_16: and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference of public perception.",

      "[6738.98\u20136750.13] SPEAKER_01: with doing this work, or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyses, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything.",

      "[8409.04\u20138426.78] SPEAKER_05: I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of the agency.",

      "[8493.14\u20138504.92] SPEAKER_05: Because when we deeply discount things beyond where we should, we are saying no to the potential income that we could use for operations and maintenance and service provision",

      "[8507.3\u20138514.91] SPEAKER_05: So on balance, real estate and real property are a finite resource, and dollars can be stretched thin.",
      "[8515.67\u20138526.32] SPEAKER_05: But how we use the opportunity to either receive money to prolong and serve the public further is a huge consideration in this.",
      "[8526.56\u20138531.19] SPEAKER_05: So although I am with you in spirit, I would be voting no on the amendment as it is right now.",

      "[8542.22\u20138543.8] SPEAKER_03: I am a little bit concerned about two things.",
      "[8543.84\u20138546.54] SPEAKER_03: The first is the language deeply affordable.",
      "[8546.56\u20138551.31] SPEAKER_03: It's a little bit ambiguous, if I'm saying that right.",
      "[8552.29\u20138562.98] SPEAKER_03: And I think using language like that can, like, what's to say, they discounted $100 to some, that's a deep discount to others, that's nothing.",
      "[8562.96\u20138570.91] SPEAKER_03: So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can divine it elsewhere.",
      "[8571.43\u20138573.64] SPEAKER_03: But I do want to leave this language.",
      "[8573.66\u20138581.95] SPEAKER_03: And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that I want.",
      "[8581.93\u20138598.73] SPEAKER_03: And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75%, but this is our property and I really would like to see it sold for the highest value to benefit all.",

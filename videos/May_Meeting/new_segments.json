      "[971.73\u2013978.08] SPEAKER_02: I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.",
      "[980.16\u2013985.61] SPEAKER_02: We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.",
      "[986.67\u2013989.72] SPEAKER_02: There are commuter routes and I",
      "[989.7\u2013998.22] SPEAKER_02: would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.",
      "[998.27\u20131004.69] SPEAKER_02: So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.",
      "[1004.73\u20131006.29] SPEAKER_02: Otherwise, Peggy has like",
      "[1006.96\u20131010.69] SPEAKER_02: two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.",
      "[1010.71\u20131013.84] SPEAKER_02: There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.",
      "[1014.82\u20131022.05] SPEAKER_02: I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of",
      "[1022.67\u20131031.73] SPEAKER_02: you know, not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.",
      "[1032.53\u20131042.49] SPEAKER_02: The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, you know, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.",
      "[1042.47\u20131051.49] SPEAKER_02: You know, I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in Peggy's district or yours exactly.",
      "[1051.51\u20131053.02] SPEAKER_02: And so.",
      "[1053.64\u20131058.55] SPEAKER_02: But creating a system where the trip cap is 40 bucks doesn't work for me.",
      "[1058.66\u20131064.07] SPEAKER_02: Creating a trip cap where it's 15 bucks doesn't work for the people in her district.",
      "[1064.15\u20131075.81] SPEAKER_02: It strikes me that the right approach would be to have different levels of financial cap and different levels of trip cap to go along with them and let people pick.",

      "[1079.67\u20131079.91] SPEAKER_02: Great.",

      "[1086.57\u20131087.67] SPEAKER_02: Depends on where you live.",
      "[1087.69\u20131089.63] SPEAKER_02: Depends on the types of trips you're going to be taking.",
      "[1089.69\u20131099.69] SPEAKER_02: But making people all fit into one size is either going to leave her people paying $20 for every single trip that they take.",
      "[1099.67\u20131108.77] SPEAKER_02: or it's going to put people in my district in a reduced number of rides because very few trips are going to cost $20 or $25.",
      "[1109.03\u20131111.08] SPEAKER_02: So those are my two pieces of feedback.",
      "[1111.1\u20131111.4] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.",

      "[1145.51\u20131152.03] SPEAKER_17: we weren't able to get to through the discussion and that also I think impacted our ability to have some interim discussions.",
      "[1152.07\u20131175.34] SPEAKER_17: So I just want folks to you know keep keep an open mind to what staff is saying and definitely share that feedback because we're on a timeline but also just recognize that well and please if I'm saying the strong introduction but what is being presented is a concept framework and so we want so we'll get more feedback and then of course staff is going to be working very closely",
      "[1175.66\u20131183.09] SPEAKER_17: with our existing customers and advocacy organizations to make further refinements and give us some more stuff to look at.",

      "[1191.03\u20131203.53] SPEAKER_17: And I'm also listening and taking notes and I know staff is, so I would just urge if anyone has thoughts one way or another, please share them tonight since we are also on",
      "[1203.81\u20131207.76] SPEAKER_17: timeline with our existing partners and those contracts as well.",

      "[1219.74\u20131223.25] SPEAKER_06: So I saw I seen one of those slot these slides that it says there's",
      "[1223.54\u20131232.07] SPEAKER_06: In December of 2024, there were about 2,900 total active customers of access on demand.",
      "[1233.13\u20131238.29] SPEAKER_06: So there were 2,900 people, roughly, who used it in all of December.",
      "[1239.07\u20131239.57] SPEAKER_06: Is that right?",
      "[1240.91\u20131243.52] SPEAKER_20: I know that would be for the year, I believe.",
      "[1244.6\u20131245.28] SPEAKER_06: Let me just.",
      "[1245.42\u20131245.94] SPEAKER_06: OK.",
      "[1245.96\u20131250.95] SPEAKER_06: So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year.",
      "[1251.23\u20131251.69] SPEAKER_06: That's it.",
      "[1252.58\u20131265.27] SPEAKER_06: And so I guess what I'm trying to just understand is, if we were going to spend, say, $10 million or $15 million on 2,900 people,",
      "[1265.74\u20131270.81] SPEAKER_06: What do we think the equivalent is for just our regular riders?",
      "[1271.11\u20131272.05] SPEAKER_06: Do we have any guess?",
      "[1272.67\u20131275.03] SPEAKER_06: I mean, I know people have different ridership.",
      "[1275.07\u20131289.43] SPEAKER_06: If we have a million customers a year and it's the majority of our budget, I'm just trying to get a sense of how the per-person spend for a regular rider compares to the per-person spend for access on demand.",
      "[1291.71\u20131293.76] SPEAKER_20: Go ahead, Deborah.",
      "[1295.54\u20131299.05] SPEAKER_16: So if I can, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question.",
      "[1299.31\u20131301.75] SPEAKER_16: I would not want us to conjecture and speculate.",
      "[1301.81\u20131303.62] SPEAKER_16: We could double back and give you those numbers.",
      "[1304.52\u20131310.25] SPEAKER_16: As we talk about, you use the term regular writer, you're talking about those that are using fixed route service.",
      "[1310.27\u20131313.41] SPEAKER_16: I just want to be clear and intentional with the language we're using going forward.",
      "[1313.39\u20131322.19] SPEAKER_16: So we need to assess that because it's a different level of service because with fixed route bus, we're not providing curb to curb service.",
      "[1322.53\u20131326.45] SPEAKER_16: And so we can double back and share that information with the board.",
      "[1327.39\u20131331.52] SPEAKER_16: But I think it wouldn't be fruitful for us to guesstimate because this is critically important.",
      "[1331.88\u20131337.39] SPEAKER_16: But as we come back and we have some guidance, we could provide that detailed information, if you will.",
      "[1337.79\u20131338.13] SPEAKER_16: Thank you.",
      "[1340.11\u20131341.17] SPEAKER_16: Thank you.",
      "[1342.51\u20131344.59] SPEAKER_10: Any other directors comments?",
      "[1344.61\u20131345.41] SPEAKER_09: Yeah, director Guzman.",
      "[1346.35\u20131353.88] SPEAKER_05: So I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area.",
      "[1356.37\u20131360.31] SPEAKER_05: District C is fairly blessed with",
      "[1360.71\u20131369.69] SPEAKER_05: multiple forms of transit and fixed route, where this is not a particular problem, but it is an issue in the suburban areas of the region.",
      "[1370.13\u20131383.77] SPEAKER_05: And it is highly concerning that we would restrict it so much where people would be left off of the system that live within a quarter mile of a commuter bus and still not be able to access this.",
      "[1386.26\u20131398.6] SPEAKER_05: I also think that as we proceed into the future after the demographers presentation to the finance and planning committee, a big concern will be our aging population in the region.",
      "[1399.48\u20131404.62] SPEAKER_05: And it's a, you know, somebody said that this is a drop in the bucket for our budget.",
      "[1405.85\u20131416.12] SPEAKER_05: Maybe right now, but eventually this is going to catch up with us, which is why we're having this conversation and access on demand and folks that are able to",
      "[1416.45\u20131430.93] SPEAKER_05: or out of need, utilize this system, need to be considered as humans first and how we serve them, which is our mission, right?",
      "[1430.95\u20131432.64] SPEAKER_05: They need connection as well.",
      "[1433.11\u20131446.55] SPEAKER_05: and not every one of them will be able to jump from a, jump, roll, walk, shuffle to a fixed route form of transportation to get them to their destinations.",
      "[1447.51\u20131454.08] SPEAKER_05: I have a question about the time on this, right?",
      "[1454.54\u20131459.35] SPEAKER_05: If it's mirroring regular service provision for the whole region,",
      "[1460.58\u20131468.37] SPEAKER_05: It kind of makes sense, but I would still be concerned for the reasons that emergencies don't happen on RTD schedule.",
      "[1469.37\u20131478.38] SPEAKER_05: And so somebody who already has a specific need for this type of transportation usage might need to go to the doctor.",
      "[1478.92\u20131481.61] SPEAKER_05: And what do they do if they're unable to drive?",
      "[1482.13\u20131492.69] SPEAKER_05: And regular bus service is not something that they can use because the buses aren't running a two o'clock in the morning emergency room visit is not unheard of and not uncommon in anybody's life.",
      "[1493.25\u20131496.01] SPEAKER_05: And yet what do we do to take care of those that are most vulnerable.",
      "[1497.4\u20131500.64] SPEAKER_05: So for me, I would really want to see some clarity around",
      "[1501.03\u20131502.05] SPEAKER_05: those two areas.",
      "[1503.19\u20131508.7] SPEAKER_05: I am frankly less concerned about minimal difference of cost savings.",
      "[1509.62\u20131512.14] SPEAKER_05: I mean, we're talking $5 million.",
      "[1512.18\u20131518.3] SPEAKER_05: That's not really the top priority for me on that part.",
      "[1518.68\u20131543.56] SPEAKER_05: right now it will eventually get there because this will likely continue to grow but I do want to make sure that we are basing ourselves in reality to serve the taxpayers needs and this is a need right this is not a desire as some of the other services we want to grow and create are this one is an actual need and so I want to be clear in my language on that and why I'm",
      "[1544.57\u20131546.91] SPEAKER_05: depositing these comments within that framework.",
      "[1547.26\u20131548.48] SPEAKER_05: So that would be my feedback.",
      "[1548.5\u20131552.99] SPEAKER_05: I'd like to see something a little bit different on those two things, the service area and the time for service.",
      "[1553.17\u20131553.48] SPEAKER_05: Thank you.",
      "[1554.06\u20131554.76] SPEAKER_05: Thank you, Director.",

      "[1559.44\u20131561.75] SPEAKER_04: I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you just said.",
      "[1561.77\u20131571.16] SPEAKER_04: I represent Arvada, and Arvada is actually the fastest growing aging population.",
      "[1571.36\u20131572.56] SPEAKER_04: However, I said that.",
      "[1572.64\u20131573.51] SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure I said it right.",
      "[1574.17\u20131579.64] SPEAKER_04: And a lot of our service is not in the areas where we have those aging people.",
      "[1580.2\u20131582.84] SPEAKER_04: So I'd really like to see",
      "[1583.39\u20131585.44] SPEAKER_04: just the boundary kept the same.",
      "[1585.56\u20131590.48] SPEAKER_04: I'm also really again with director Guzman keeping it as a full 24 seven.",
      "[1590.5\u20131606.9] SPEAKER_04: I just like I have a friend in a wheelchair and I just think about her trying like if she didn't live where she lived if she lived where I live she would have such a difficult time getting you know around her community and I won't just",
      "[1607.41\u20131612.9] SPEAKER_04: especially like if the service is outside of that time period, it's just precluding her life.",
      "[1612.96\u20131624.1] SPEAKER_04: And I know we don't all have these, the same abilities when we're riding the bus, but for a person with disability that's blind or in a wheelchair, I think that we can sort of extend them the grace that they deserve.",
      "[1625.01\u20131627.45] SPEAKER_04: I also would like to see the cap stay at 60.",
      "[1627.61\u20131640.82] SPEAKER_04: I think that, again, I know that it's a, you know, less than 10% of the population go above the 50 rides, but I think it's still like that's, we're giving them access to a free and full life.",
      "[1641.88\u20131650.07] SPEAKER_04: And I think if we are gonna go with the 650, I think that that to me is fine, but I also think that it would be imperative that we really,",
      "[1650.05\u20131677.56] SPEAKER_04: put out the live program and let let those writers know That there is another option like there's always with someone the other day she Lives about three miles away from where she works and you know She can afford it, but just barely and she didn't know about the live program So I think that there's we're missing an opportunity there specifically with these With these writers so and then my last one is just a request is it possible to get a map of",
      "[1677.54\u20131692.32] SPEAKER_04: like sort of like a density map of where AOD is like highly being used to sort of go with that, like thinking about, you know, West Jefferson County versus central Denver, just kind of see what that looks like.",
      "[1692.42\u20131699.61] SPEAKER_04: Obviously we want to anonymize the data, but I think it's sort of just would be interesting for us to know where the sort of hotspots of usage are.",
      "[1699.64\u20131700.91] SPEAKER_04: Thank you.",

      "[2025.43\u20132026.76] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.",
      "[2028.12\u20132042.98] SPEAKER_02: Is there any step during enrollment of AAR and AOD where we ask people if they are enrolled in the live program and ask them, hey, we're taking 14 other pieces of documentation from you.",
      "[2043.0\u20132046.98] SPEAKER_02: I mean, AAR is remarkably complicated to sign up for.",
      "[2047.72\u20132053.91] SPEAKER_02: Is there any part of that process where we try to enroll them in the live program as well?",
      "[2053.95\u20132055.07] SPEAKER_02: And then I have a quick follow up.",
      "[2059.84\u20132062.43] SPEAKER_20: I will have to find out about that as part of the process.",
      "[2062.83\u20132067.73] SPEAKER_20: Um, and we will confirm if that is, you know, how that is handled as, as part of the process.",
      "[2068.86\u20132069.07] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.",
      "[2069.16\u20132079.45] SPEAKER_02: So, yeah, as a, as a first thing I would say that since we're going to be updating this to offer the, the live discount and, and not make it free, uh, it should be required as part of the process.",
      "[2079.51\u20132087.98] SPEAKER_02: If you're going through to sign up for AOD or AAR, some point in that process to set, to ask someone to affirm that they are either already signed up or,",
      "[2088.23\u20132092.59] SPEAKER_02: haven't signed up or whatever, and then give them the opportunity to make it super easy.",
      "[2092.65\u20132099.22] SPEAKER_02: Because we only have 15,000 people signed up for live right now, and we have 180 something thousand boardings every day.",
      "[2099.34\u20132105.89] SPEAKER_02: And I think only about half the people in AOD are currently signed up for, or AAR currently signed up for live.",
      "[2105.91\u20132108.29] SPEAKER_02: So definitely something I'd like to see there.",
      "[2108.33\u20132117.66] SPEAKER_02: The second thing, I want to echo what Director Ruscha said about the effect on people who",
      "[2118.22\u20132134.3] SPEAKER_02: are low income to having these fares, but I want to take it from the other side, which is if you don't have a lot of money and you need to get around to a lot of places, then 40 trips maybe, or whatever the number ends up being, not nearly enough in a way that someone who makes more money",
      "[2134.28\u20132137.64] SPEAKER_02: can probably have some discretionary to be like, oh, I've run out of trips.",
      "[2137.72\u20132140.97] SPEAKER_02: I can afford to take an extra three or five or whatever.",
      "[2140.99\u20132145.11] SPEAKER_02: So I'm not sure that that needs to be fit into the policy here.",
      "[2145.17\u20132147.71] SPEAKER_02: I'm wary about trying to do too much too quickly.",
      "[2148.03\u20132158.52] SPEAKER_02: But I do think we need to get a report from you after, I don't know, six months a year that looks at how many trips are people on live using?",
      "[2158.76\u20132159.74] SPEAKER_02: Are they maxing out?",
      "[2160.18\u20132162.35] SPEAKER_02: Or are we seeing sort of the same curve?",
      "[2162.33\u20132175.02] SPEAKER_02: from live users as we do from regular users right now, and that might inform us to take action a year from now to try to offer the right service for people who need it.",
      "[2175.06\u20132177.1] SPEAKER_02: Some live people make decent incomes.",
      "[2177.28\u20132184.65] SPEAKER_02: Some of them are literally broke, and we need to recognize that those two groups of people have very different lived experiences.",
      "[2185.37\u20132186.22] SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Secretary.",
      "[2186.32\u20132186.47] SPEAKER_10: Ms.",
      "[2186.51\u20132186.86] SPEAKER_10: Johnson?",
      "[2187.24\u20132190.24] SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you very much, Director Nicholson.",
      "[2190.37\u20132193.09] SPEAKER_16: Mr. Chair, thank you, Director Nicholson, for the comments.",
      "[2193.55\u20132210.17] SPEAKER_16: And what I will say in reference to your request, it appeared to be a directive, but I would just offer this up to you that once we collectively agree upon the path forward in this Board acts, we can then assess what might be most prudent, because at this point in time, we don't know what we don't know.",
      "[2210.19\u20132215.98] SPEAKER_16: And relative to what you just asked, I can't commit to that without knowing what we intend to do.",
      "[2216.14\u20132217.88] SPEAKER_16: So I just had to say that for the record.",
      "[2218.08\u20132219.1] SPEAKER_16: because it seemed as if Ms.",
      "[2219.16\u20132222.77] SPEAKER_16: Baleos was giving direction, and I don't think that's appropriate at this juncture.",
      "[2223.07\u20132223.53] SPEAKER_10: Thank you.",
      "[2225.01\u20132225.33] SPEAKER_10: Thank you.",

      "[2227.75\u20132228.19] SPEAKER_10: Thank you.",
      "[2228.21\u20132234.76] SPEAKER_06: I was just kind of doing some stuff on my calculator.",
      "[2234.88\u20132245.25] SPEAKER_06: And so if we only have 3,000 people who use excess on demand, I mean, it seems like the disabled population",
      "[2245.57\u20132251.46] SPEAKER_06: You know, it might be 300,000 people in Denver or something, you know, much, much larger.",
      "[2252.94\u20132259.5] SPEAKER_06: Do we, how do, how confident are we of our projection that it'll stay at around, I mean, or, or however much we think it'll increase?",
      "[2259.52\u20132271.05] SPEAKER_06: I mean, what do we think the total number of active users might become and why won't it become, you know, several, many multiples more than 3,000 or so?",
      "[2276.67\u20132285.48] SPEAKER_16: First, if I may, just for everyone's identification, you probably have heard this over the course of several months in the public comment discussions.",
      "[2286.18\u20132301.38] SPEAKER_16: When we talk about access on demand, currently as it's configured, recognizing that we're using private entities, transportation network companies in particular, not all of the vehicles are outfitted to be wheelchair accessible.",
      "[2301.65\u20132309.43] SPEAKER_16: So that's a critical element when we're talking about the population because there's different disabilities that individuals have.",
      "[2309.51\u20132316.4] SPEAKER_16: Some may have cognitive, somebody may be using a mobility device, which can't be accommodated going forward.",
      "[2316.42\u20132319.35] SPEAKER_16: So I just wanted to provide that context prior to Ms.",
      "[2319.37\u20132324.23] SPEAKER_16: Vallejo's answering the question because that has not been factored into this conversation this evening.",
      "[2324.25\u20132325.66] SPEAKER_16: And I believe it's a germane point.",
      "[2327.68\u20132328.28] SPEAKER_16: Thank you, Director.",
      "[2328.78\u20132333.16] SPEAKER_20: And I don't think I need to add anything that was really exactly what I was going to say.",
      "[2333.22\u20132338.85] SPEAKER_20: Not everyone is able to use the access on demand service that is eligible for excessive ride.",
      "[2339.25\u20132340.63] SPEAKER_20: Other is a difference there.",
      "[2341.29\u20132342.21] SPEAKER_06: Can I just follow up?",
      "[2342.23\u20132349.16] SPEAKER_06: But I mean, surely many more people than 3000 in the metro area would be eligible though.",
      "[2350.68\u20132355.45] SPEAKER_20: Well, and again, we have continued continue to see substantial growth.",
      "[2355.86\u20132360.29] SPEAKER_20: in the number of customers that are beginning to use the service.",
      "[2360.75\u20132367.62] SPEAKER_20: Again, the trips that we are seeing continue to grow even into this year, so we are seeing quite significant growth still.",
      "[2370.76\u20132371.08] SPEAKER_10: Thank you.",
      "[2371.26\u20132371.58] SPEAKER_10: Thank you.",
      "[2372.39\u20132372.69] SPEAKER_10: Thank you.",
      "[2373.93\u20132375.39] SPEAKER_10: Any further questions, comments?",

      "[2383.42\u20132384.1] SPEAKER_10: So thank you.",
      "[2384.72\u20132385.82] SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.",
      "[2385.86\u20132388.71] SPEAKER_16: This was in the sense that we do have some guidance now.",
      "[2388.75\u20132391.73] SPEAKER_16: We know what we need to do as we do further outreach.",
      "[2391.77\u20132394.16] SPEAKER_16: So thank you all very much for the opportunity.",
      "[2394.68\u20132404.35] SPEAKER_16: And when we come back in July with a recommended action, hopefully we can all rally around that, recognizing the public comments that we heard in the direction in which you provide it.",
      "[2404.37\u20132404.73] SPEAKER_16: Thank you.",
      "[2405.01\u20132405.31] SPEAKER_05: Thank you.",

      "[2406.8\u20132410.18] SPEAKER_05: Will that recommended action be going through operation safety and security?",

      "[2422.63\u20132425.28] SPEAKER_16: The only reason why this didn't happen because it's time sensitive.",
      "[2425.7\u20132426.3] SPEAKER_16: So thank you.",
      "[2426.98\u20132427.68] SPEAKER_10: Thank you very much.",

      "[3350.98\u20133360.05] SPEAKER_16: Keeping in mind those rigorous restrictions were put into place due to the fact that we enhanced our inspections of track",

      "[4934.13\u20134952.61] SPEAKER_16: Relative to the comments that were made, and thank you very much, Director Catlin, as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned being part of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in Greater Seattle and then Chicago Transit Authority.",
      "[4954.39\u20134959.19] SPEAKER_16: That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there,",
      "[4959.66\u20134963.02] SPEAKER_16: This is not correct relative to where we sit.",
      "[4963.48\u20134970.93] SPEAKER_16: And more specifically, I do know our director of civil rights when we were going through this quite naturally in the role that he is in.",
      "[4970.99\u20134976.02] SPEAKER_16: He and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies.",
      "[4976.04\u20134981.36] SPEAKER_16: So that's the communique that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving this information.",
      "[4981.6\u20134986.21] SPEAKER_16: So Mr. Green, if you want to just expound succinctly and briefly.",
      "[4986.66\u20134992.25] SPEAKER_01: Yes, thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson, to expand upon the response.",
      "[4992.29\u20135001.74] SPEAKER_01: I just also want to ground us in first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes.",
      "[5002.38\u20135009.53] SPEAKER_01: And in doing that audit, we looked at 22, rather 23 different organizations, which includes the four.",
      "[5009.51\u20135013.69] SPEAKER_01: Marta, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority.",
      "[5014.23\u20135025.43] SPEAKER_01: And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right?",
      "[5025.63\u20135027.57] SPEAKER_01: And ours is stacked in the middle.",
      "[5027.61\u20135029.53] SPEAKER_01: So I want to give you some numbers here.",
      "[5030.29\u20135032.82] SPEAKER_01: So for the four that I just mentioned,",
      "[5033.91\u20135042.6] SPEAKER_01: Marta has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%.",
      "[5043.62\u20135054.64] SPEAKER_01: And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, six out of that 23 have 5% or less, two have 8%,",
      "[5054.97\u20135063.93] SPEAKER_01: six, which includes us, or seven, including us, is at 10%, three at 15%, and then three at 20%.",
      "[5064.15\u20135070.8] SPEAKER_01: And in my over eight years of doing this work, and I'll just say that",
      "[5070.78\u20135082.88] SPEAKER_01: When you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve, specifically with Title VI.",
      "[5083.46\u20135089.11] SPEAKER_01: Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service.",
      "[5089.82\u20135097.15] SPEAKER_01: There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth.",
      "[5097.67\u20135109.14] SPEAKER_01: This is just a mechanism for the agency, such as RTD and the board of directors, so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant.",
      "[5109.16\u20135117.33] SPEAKER_01: So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.",
      "[5119.35\u20135121.71] SPEAKER_08: I've director Ruchin next.",
      "[5126.58\u20135131.23] SPEAKER_17: Um, I did have a question, but I also, um, treasure banker had her hand up and it was her motion.",
      "[5131.33\u20135133.61] SPEAKER_17: So I'm happy to, to wait if that was in response.",

      "[5136.34\u20135142.26] SPEAKER_19: Um, I, I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic.",
      "[5143.23\u20135146.47] SPEAKER_19: So how can we restore",
      "[5147.75\u20135152.4] SPEAKER_19: let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several years ago.",
      "[5152.84\u20135160.65] SPEAKER_19: How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had that service?",
      "[5161.54\u20135164.66] SPEAKER_19: And so now we're being told",
      "[5164.64\u20135173.77] SPEAKER_19: that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to have it.",
      "[5174.93\u20135182.06] SPEAKER_19: And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to pre-pandemic levels?",
      "[5183.4\u20135183.56] SPEAKER_08: Ms.",

      "[5185.93\u20135187.51] SPEAKER_16: That question is better suited for me.",
      "[5187.55\u20135191.81] SPEAKER_16: Relative to the service delivery framework that we have,",
      "[5192.1\u20135210.8] SPEAKER_16: While Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy service is based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours, but more specifically at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP.",
      "[5211.44\u20135217.67] SPEAKER_16: When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were.",
      "[5218.32\u20135220.78] SPEAKER_16: 85% of what service levels were in 2019.",
      "[5221.55\u20135230.72] SPEAKER_16: We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward.",
      "[5231.78\u20135236.97] SPEAKER_16: What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious",
      "[5237.39\u20135241.8] SPEAKER_16: and how we're applying service because we do want to ensure there's equity.",
      "[5241.84\u20135248.37] SPEAKER_16: I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well.",
      "[5248.81\u20135259.33] SPEAKER_16: As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change.",
      "[5259.66\u20135282.41] SPEAKER_16: That is up to the board quite naturally, but I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service keeping in mind that all transit agencies across, you know, the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power.",
      "[5283.14\u20135288.48] SPEAKER_16: Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio.",
      "[5288.59\u20135298.58] SPEAKER_16: What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio.",
      "[5298.92\u20135306.25] SPEAKER_16: We've deviated from that and have a waiver and we're right sizing the fleet as we move forward.",
      "[5306.29\u20135312.32] SPEAKER_16: So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory or were.",
      "[5312.5\u20135313.94] SPEAKER_16: And we're coming back from that.",
      "[5314.92\u20135327.19] SPEAKER_16: We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area from an origin and destination vantage point just by virtue of how our service area is going forward.",
      "[5327.69\u20135331.03] SPEAKER_16: So I'm not providing this to say I don't.",
      "[5331.01\u20135333.25] SPEAKER_16: understand what you're trying to do.",
      "[5333.27\u20135338.96] SPEAKER_16: And as I share it with you, I do clearly and we want to work within the frameworks that we have.",
      "[5339.6\u20135345.43] SPEAKER_16: But a whole cell of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible.",
      "[5345.51\u20135353.58] SPEAKER_16: And I say it from the vantage point of, we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour.",
      "[5354.03\u20135355.55] SPEAKER_16: but that was out on the street.",
      "[5355.85\u20135359.32] SPEAKER_16: Does that really yield the return on investment going forward?",
      "[5359.42\u20135366.97] SPEAKER_16: Hence, that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services going forward.",
      "[5367.39\u20135368.85] SPEAKER_19: Okay, but if I can.",
      "[5368.99\u20135370.93] SPEAKER_19: Treasure, yeah.",
      "[5371.01\u20135375.02] SPEAKER_19: Some of the issues that you just raised are important.",
      "[5375.19\u20135375.82] SPEAKER_19: There's no doubt.",
      "[5376.16\u20135380.42] SPEAKER_19: However, I don't believe it goes to the equity calculation.",
      "[5382.88\u20135383.02] SPEAKER_19: I",
      "[5385.08\u20135400.76] SPEAKER_19: What I think is important to to hear from staff and I know we're going to be talking about this in our retreat, which is I'm looking forward to that is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in three years.",
      "[5401.43\u20135420.99] SPEAKER_19: what barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110, and start quickly, or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher service levels.",
      "[5422.96\u20135423.12] SPEAKER_16: Ms.",
      "[5423.16\u20135423.5] SPEAKER_16: Johnson.",

      "[5424.2\u20135427.64] SPEAKER_16: There's a couple of external factors that play into that.",
      "[5427.99\u20135434.93] SPEAKER_16: quite naturally when we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate and the lack of people commuting in.",
      "[5435.43\u20135447.31] SPEAKER_16: It's important to keep in mind that there was, I'm forgetting the name, but the city and county of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the occupancy levels.",
      "[5447.57\u20135451.54] SPEAKER_16: But more specifically, what's important to note is that",
      "[5451.52\u20135456.73] SPEAKER_16: there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to this central business district.",
      "[5457.95\u20135468.39] SPEAKER_16: I believe the last time I looked at stats, city and county at Denver was in the bottom three out of out of 50 major cities.",
      "[5468.83\u20135472.49] SPEAKER_16: And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number",
      "[5474.08\u20135478.92] SPEAKER_16: is the third state relative to remote work and then City of Boulder is number one.",
      "[5479.34\u20135487.09] SPEAKER_16: While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic.",
      "[5487.45\u20135496.88] SPEAKER_16: How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before?",
      "[5497.56\u20135501.49] SPEAKER_16: I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward",
      "[5501.84\u20135525.37] SPEAKER_16: relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery.",
      "[5525.89\u20135528.96] SPEAKER_16: And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power,",
      "[5529.26\u20135553.59] SPEAKER_16: we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available where people whereby were working extra shifts and then we didn't have enough people for daily pullout on those other routes.",
      "[5554.01\u20135557.61] SPEAKER_16: And so I'm providing that context to say",
      "[5557.93\u20135577.93] SPEAKER_16: to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do, but to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of this agency's.",
      "[5580.02\u20135580.44] SPEAKER_17: Thanks, sir.",
      "[5580.48\u20135583.86] SPEAKER_17: So I have a question for legal.",
      "[5585.28\u20135595.48] SPEAKER_17: So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I want to be careful of my words.",
      "[5597.3\u20135608.19] SPEAKER_17: Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public comment process or",
      "[5608.74\u20135613.91] SPEAKER_17: Is that something that we, I guess, I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area.",
      "[5613.99\u20135616.13] SPEAKER_17: And I wanted to get a bit of feedback on that.",
      "[5616.59\u20135621.22] SPEAKER_17: Now, to disparage the motion, I just also want to understand the potential legal implications.",
      "[5626.32\u20135628.69] SPEAKER_16: I will address that question.",
      "[5629.23\u20135631.89] SPEAKER_16: And then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound.",
      "[5631.99\u20135635.03] SPEAKER_16: I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement,",
      "[5635.61\u20135659.39] SPEAKER_16: and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference of public perception.",
      "[5659.85\u20135665.78] SPEAKER_16: There is leeway relative to the circular in light of what can be done.",
      "[5665.86\u20135678.94] SPEAKER_16: We are sitting here on May 28th, recognizing that we have a new administration and that we do need to have a Title VI program that's submitted and we have been engaged on this topic since January.",
      "[5679.41\u20135682.03] SPEAKER_16: That's not to negate any amendments or anything like that.",
      "[5682.11\u20135684.61] SPEAKER_16: I am just trying to answer the question.",
      "[5684.8\u20135691.97] SPEAKER_16: But more specifically, Mr. Green, since you are very well-versed in 4702.1B, I would yield the floor to you.",
      "[5692.02\u20135696.07] SPEAKER_16: And that's the citation for the FTA circular that we're talking about.",
      "[5696.51\u20135696.69] SPEAKER_01: Yes.",
      "[5696.75\u20135698.87] SPEAKER_01: Thank you so much, GM CEO Johnson.",

      "[5708.38\u20135712.31] SPEAKER_01: But to piggyback off what GM CEO Johnson has noted,",
      "[5713.33\u20135720.37] SPEAKER_01: That is, I would couch that as the bigger risk is when we think about establishing policy, right?",
      "[5720.43\u20135725.05] SPEAKER_01: As it relates to 4702.1B, the FTA Title VI circular.",
      "[5725.43\u20135734.85] SPEAKER_01: it does call upon the agency to do a lot of outreach and public involvement to ensure that we are collecting that feedback to inform decisions.",
      "[5735.41\u20135748.79] SPEAKER_01: So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as the policy.",
      "[5749.49\u20135753.62] SPEAKER_01: So, but with respect to the circular, we can, i.e.",
      "[5753.94\u20135757.89] SPEAKER_01: the board of directors could adopt a different threshold.",
      "[5757.9\u20135771.0] SPEAKER_01: So for example, the one that director banker has put forth, although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update.",
      "[5771.76\u20135779.03] SPEAKER_01: There is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the board is ultimately approving the policy.",
      "[5780.92\u20135781.32] SPEAKER_01: Thank you.",
      "[5782.18\u20135786.09] SPEAKER_10: Director Gysinger and then Director Larson.",

      "[5795.38\u20135810.4] SPEAKER_06: I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were for service changes, this Title VI analysis that were in the",
      "[5810.58\u20135833.1] SPEAKER_06: the board packet, and it seemed like most of the time we, you know, sometimes there was a little bit of disparate impact on one route or the other, but mostly it sort of ended up that in the aggregate there wasn't really much, and there were legitimate justifications for what there was on an individual basis.",
      "[5833.9\u20135838.04] SPEAKER_06: I guess my, you know, my basic question is with",
      "[5838.39\u20135846.48] SPEAKER_06: with regard to this update and the changes that we're proposing, are we just, I mean, is there really a problem here?",
      "[5846.5\u20135848.68] SPEAKER_06: Are we just making this harder for ourselves?",
      "[5848.74\u20135859.87] SPEAKER_06: Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact one place or the other.",
      "[5859.93\u20135863.72] SPEAKER_06: We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons.",
      "[5864.68\u20135868.18] SPEAKER_06: And on balance, they don't really seem to",
      "[5868.78\u20135881.67] SPEAKER_06: under our current setup, you know, ever, ever sort of look like they were, you know, there were somehow some, you know, bad intent or just inattention to who we're serving.",
      "[5881.73\u20135887.84] SPEAKER_06: It seems like we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have done anyways.",
      "[5888.21\u20135908.97] SPEAKER_06: Why put sort of a greater burden, sort of regulate ourselves more than we have to, and why not just give us the freedom to operate as we would as much as we can, given that we don't, you know, it doesn't necessarily seem like it's been a problem for a long time, at least from what I could see.",
      "[5909.01\u20135917.4] SPEAKER_06: I mean, there weren't that many Title VI complaints that I could, that I, in the information that was provided.",

      "[6710.85\u20136738.71] SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when we think about what we're ultimately trying to achieve and a percentage that's mathematically consistent relative to the populations that we serve, so in doing this work, given my background, right, in doing an assessment of whether if we, and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is",
      "[6738.98\u20136750.13] SPEAKER_01: with doing this work, or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyses, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything.",

      "[9597.86\u20139605.89] SPEAKER_17: I might have missed part of the closed captioning, but I think you said you don't think we should be applying accessibility minimums to market rate.",
      "[9606.83\u20139607.05] SPEAKER_17: Okay.",
      "[9607.39\u20139607.99] SPEAKER_17: That's exact.",

      "[9608.83\u20139609.69] SPEAKER_17: So this amendment doesn't do that.",
      "[9610.09\u20139623.23] SPEAKER_17: And the second piece, um, the reason why I didn't say it doesn't reference discounts is because, uh, so this goes at the end of the policy, which is all, like the way it's nested under the paragraph, the discount, this is talking about when discounts apply, if that makes sense.",
      "[9623.61\u20139624.39] SPEAKER_17: So it's just,",
      "[9625.9\u20139629.17] SPEAKER_17: It does what you said you wanted it to do.",
      "[9629.19\u20139630.13] SPEAKER_17: It's just late.",

      "[9638.4\u20139650.14] SPEAKER_02: Under what, because you mentioned that Denver has a policy that supersede or that matches this and the state currently is considering a policy that would supersede it, but currently does not.",
      "[9650.67\u20139654.66] SPEAKER_02: Under what circumstances would this have any effect at all?",
      "[9654.84\u20139662.93] SPEAKER_02: Like in what circumstances can you imagine in your professional capacity, do you see this being something that would matter?",

      "[9669.84\u20139675.07] SPEAKER_18: And Director Rush has mentioned some, I'm not aware of them, but this is not my area of expertise.",
      "[9675.09\u20139680.06] SPEAKER_18: So, but in a jurisdiction that does not already have those requirements that is not",
      "[9680.26\u20139693.94] SPEAKER_18: accepting HUD money, and if Colorado Department of Housing changes their rules, does not accept Department of Housing money, then that project would then be subject to this policy requirement.",

      "[9698.54\u20139710.18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just, I guess, for Director Rusher, Director Guzman, are there any jurisdictions in the RTD service area that don't have that same requirement that Denver does?",
      "[9712.1\u20139712.9] SPEAKER_10: either directors?",
      "[9714.3\u20139718.99] SPEAKER_17: Yeah, I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate jurisdictions.",

      "[9727.9\u20139733.29] SPEAKER_17: We spend a lot of time talking about equity today, including spending a significant amount of time talking about people with disabilities.",
      "[9733.81\u20139739.54] SPEAKER_17: And so just again, recognizing that the HUD requirement",
      "[9742.61\u20139758.49] SPEAKER_17: is about equity and not excluding people on the basis of disability from accessing affordable housing because the FH Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and other areas of anti-discrimination law, including state law, don't effectively",
      "[9759.0\u20139760.38] SPEAKER_17: covered that aspect.",
      "[9761.6\u20139763.04] SPEAKER_17: Sorry, that was more than what you asked.",
      "[9763.06\u20139765.12] SPEAKER_17: But no, I can't answer your question.",
      "[9766.87\u20139777.08] SPEAKER_17: Just like you probably couldn't answer my question about every single jurisdiction in the RTD region that has something regarding parking minimums.",
      "[9778.02\u20139779.13] SPEAKER_17: It's a broad concept.",
      "[9780.53\u20139781.29] SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Director Usha.",
      "[9781.73\u20139783.77] SPEAKER_10: Any further conversation on this amendment?",

      "[9785.66\u20139787.4] SPEAKER_05: I will offer this last thing.",
      "[9787.73\u20139801.91] SPEAKER_05: and then we probably should go to a vote, but very simply put, we need to make sure that we are protecting the vulnerable, providing access to these housing units.",
      "[9802.19\u20139805.48] SPEAKER_05: Even in the city and county of Denver's building codes is not clear.",
      "[9805.54\u20139806.84] SPEAKER_05: It's as clear as mud.",
      "[9807.14\u20139813.33] SPEAKER_05: There is reference to this if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not necessarily required.",
      "[9813.37\u20139822.16] SPEAKER_05: We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to get licensed.",
      "[9822.84\u20139835.41] SPEAKER_05: And so to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units, I would like to see this in the policy.",
      "[9835.59\u20139848.38] SPEAKER_05: I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement that's established.",
      "[9848.42\u20139860.66] SPEAKER_05: And although it is established in other places, it is not established in our policy, and we are the government of this region, and we should take it seriously that we have a due diligence and responsibility to those members of our community that would need this.",

      "[9870.63\u20139881.67] SPEAKER_04: Any time that we can be supportive of our communities most in need, those suffering from a whole variety of disabilities, I want to be able to put our best foot forward there.",
      "[9882.11\u20139886.54] SPEAKER_04: And while we can't call specific jurisdictions, if there is that",
      "[9886.52\u20139893.5] SPEAKER_04: chance that there is a jurisdiction that isn't meeting this requirement, then we should make sure we're getting there.",
      "[9893.56\u20139899.09] SPEAKER_04: And if in the process the state comes up with something better or something in the future, that's okay.",
      "[9899.45\u20139906.5] SPEAKER_04: But I think that this is a safety net in my mind about how to really get there for this community.",
      "[9908.73\u20139925.16] SPEAKER_04: I think that also, as we're tying these developments, spur off around our transit, that's also giving them better access to the resources and giving them the life that they want and the freedom of movement that we so cherish.",

    "text": "Joan Peck: Good evening. Chair Bouquet and Director Johnson and Board, thank you so much for letting me address you tonight. I am here representing not only the city of Longmont, but the Front Range Passenger Rail District Board, which I am the secretary of. I want you to know right off the bat that the Board has as many questions about this new draft of IGA that you do. So we are looking at it, scrutinizing it as well, but are very, very excited about the prospect of being able to work together and see this rail come to completion. I also want to thank this Board for the partnership that we have with our RIDE Longmont. We have exceeded 27,000 rides since December, which far outpaced the parent company of Via in Seattle. So we're really proud of that, and that is directly because of the partnership we are doing with you. So thank you very much. I am also going to ask for the LX1 to be restored. I get a little frustrated when you use ridership as a reason for not restoring that, because Bustang now, which is at the Firestone hub, is packed. Those buses are packed and that ridership should belong to RTD. And it makes me sad that that bus was cut and our people now aren't interested that much in RTD because Bustang is taking care of it and getting our money. I also want to let you know that I'm going to-- I'm switching hats here from the FRPR Board as well as city of Longmont. I want you to know that I am very excited about this rail for many reasons. First of all, it's an economic driver, and it is a huge project that I think that we should take pride in together. And to think about-- I know the cost is huge on both sides, but when we first heard about the cost of the Northwest corridor in about 2017, it was $1.2 or $1.4 billion. And now BNSF's value to you, to RTD, is 650 million. So that is quite a difference, and part of that is due to the fact that the last three cities on the Northwest corridor, Westminster, Broomfield, and Louisville are being taken off of your plate and FRPR is going to operate them. I don't know, as none of us know, how that funding is going to work out. But what I would like to offer and invite the RTD Executive Board. I think, I believe that when we sit down face to face and work out what it is we think can happen-- because our boards are the ones that are going to decide this, one way or the other. We're the ones that are going to vote. So if you would think about the Executive Committee and the Executive Board or Committee of FRPR and RTD sitting down together and just diving into this IGA and trying to figure out what can we vote for, what will really work for both of us, both districts. For me, that would be better in being able to see people face to face, emotions, talking and just working through it. Because I never like going through third parties telling us what we should or shouldn't be doing. But I understand that the Joint Service is probably going to happen. How do we want it to happen? And it is our boards that will decide that in the end. So thank you very much, and let's just keep rolling along.",

I really appreciate it. Thank you, Board, for the public participation. I want to thank you for what you've done in the past. You've had courage, vision, and guts to start this FasTracks program. I mean, I remember when I first moved to Denver 40 years ago, there was no such thing. I came from Chicago. And there was no such thing, and the Board had this vision and you went forward with it. And now there's a little bit of-- I think more than a little bit of hesitation about coming in all the way up to Longmont. Well, I want you to know that Longmont is a wonderful place. We just don't trust you all that much anymore because we've been paying for all the tax-- been paying taxes since 2005. But we're looking forward to this Board having the courage and the guts and the vision to make this happen for our community and communities down the line that have been paying taxes since 2005 on this. We voted to support this, and we still support it. It's just a little touchy right now. I do want to address equity. We look at equity in Longmont as how come Highlands Ranch has access to this wonderful rail? How come Boulder has so many buses? And in Longmont, we don't have so many buses. We keep getting cut. And of course, we don't have our rail yet either. And so we look at equity in a different way than you do. I also know that you have looked at equity in terms of-- in a different way that doesn't really make sense to us when we look at Boulder being very high income and having all their buses and good transportation. Highlands Ranch is another good example of a fairly high income community that has access to passenger rail. We, in Longmont, look for a more-- shall I say, a looser version of the equity argument. Right now it looks like the equity argument is being used so that we won't get it. On the other hand. I've heard some good things. I'm excited about what could happen. Again, Longmont is still-- we're developing trust, I hope, with the RTD. My neighbors don't particularly trust you. When I was walking around with one petition or another, they didn't want to even let me in the door when I said RTD. So thank you for this opportunity and I strongly support the Northwest Rail and I hope you will too.",

I was a brand new 18- year-old in 2004, and here we are 21 years later, and we still don't-- instead of a train to Longmont or more dedicated bus services, even, you have cut services to Longmont. And so it's frustrating to be here asking for more or for what we voted for and what you're legally obligated to provide based on the results of that election. In the 21 years since I voted for that, I ended up living in Chicago for a few years. I enjoyed a robust public transit system. I enjoyed the-- I took the bus, I took trains to work. I took trains to play. I took trains to the suburbs, to the city. And it was an economic driver for every community that was involved. There's bustling downtowns wherever you go. And like others have said, the people in Longmont are not inclined to trust RTD because the trust has been broken, that we keep getting pushed off and pushed off and pushed off. And so I would ask that you vote in favor of the Northwest Rail expansion, but also that you don't limit it to three trips every weekday, but that you have the vision to allow us to bring our money to Denver, to other communities for entertainment purposes as well as work purposes.

    "text": "Connor Shea: Good evening, Board. My name is Connor Shea and I live in the Baker neighborhood of Denver. I'm here representing the Baker Historic Neighborhood Association as a member of its board. I live a few blocks from the Alameda station, and I use RTD's bus and rail services pretty frequently. As you're probably aware, Denver is in the process of considering a women's soccer league stadium at the former Gates Rubber Factory site, just west of the I-25 and Broadway Station. As the stadium will be across from the freight rail tracks-- across the freight rail tracks from the RTD station, transit riders need to cross over the FasTracks to reach the stadium from the various RTD bus and rail stations-- bus and rail connections at the station. Currently, the only pedestrian access route from the Broadway Station is the Southern Bridge, sometimes referred to as the bridge to nowhere. That path will be about 3/4 of a mile going from the station to the stadium, and then the same distance going back after a soccer game or other event at the venue. As a neighborhood, we intend to push for a North Bridge to the site connecting the station and stadium as directly as possible. And I'm here to ask for RTD's cooperation on this, since a bridge would require the use of RTD land on the Broadway Station. North Bridge has been in most past plans for development of the site but is considered optional as part of the non-binding agreement between the city and the stadium owners that city council passed a few weeks ago. The North Bridge connection would mean only one quarter mile of walking to go from the RTD station to the stadium. In total, the bridge would-- a North Bridge would save a full mile of walking, about 20 minutes, when going to the stadium and then back after an event ends. We believe that the shorter distance with the North Pedestrian Bridge would encourage significantly more transit usage when going to events at the stadium. The Broadway Station is accessible from the D, E, and H lines without a transfer, and all other lines with only one transfer. It's also accessible from a variety of bus routes. That would reduce traffic and emissions coming through our neighborhood and the other neighborhoods adjacent to the stadium. North Bridge would be good for our neighborhood, for the safety of pedestrians and transit users, as they won't have to cross as many streets when accessing the stadium, and would be good for RTD and extra fares and customers from events at the stadium. The extra bridge would provide better connections and redundancy for pedestrians. It would especially improve accessibility for folks with limited mobility. I'm here to ask for RTD's cooperation and support on getting this included in the stadium project, as we work on negotiating a community benefits agreement with the developer over the next few months. I sent an email to the Board and CEO Johnson about this on Friday and would be happy to receive any emails from the Board or CEO if anyone has any further questions about that.

So I was reflecting on my early days on the Board, and we were desperately trying to find the money to do the R line, which goes through district B and F, I think. I don't remember. But anyway, and Phil Washington was our Executive Director then, and he had this brilliant motto. He always said, every day, practically, we will build as much as we can as fast as we can, no matter what. But when it came time to find the money for the R line, he would pick up any nickel under any rock. And you can ask him that. And those are his words. And he opened up a meeting, a luncheon for all business leaders, small and large, to figure out, this is what we have to work with. How can we do it? And it took a series of IGAs to get this thing done. Lots of them. So we're on the way, we're moving along. Everything is great. And then Bruce Benson, who was the president of the University of Colorado, comes over to the Board and says, hey, hey. No, no, no. We need you to change the alignment of the R line and take it off of Montview Boulevard, right through Anschutz Medical Center campus. Now, you can imagine-- we're like, what? How is this-- I mean, this was a huge shock, blow to all of us. And what were we going to do? Well, you know what that means? It requires 10 votes. A super majority. And guess what? Those folks in Longmont, in the north, they weren't having it. They were not going to do it. But it required all of us, each and every one of us, to have those one on one discussions and promise, promise the people in the north, let's just get this one thing done and then we can move on to the north. Now it's their turn. Now it's time to finish the Northwest Rail. And those numbers, the finances and all of that, they'll come out. You guys will figure it out. Everybody is coming together. All those different entities, and then IGA is so critical to proceed and move forward and do what the voters elected to have done. FasTracks, they elected you to finish it. You may not even like it, but it's not you. It's the people that voted for it. It's the RTD's obligation. And by the way, of the 3.1 million people living in the district, 97% of them don't even use RTD and they're paying for that train. And now you have this wonderful, exciting, incredible opportunity to finish it and even connect beyond the district into Fort Collins. What a boon for everybody and for the entire state, quite frankly. So I'm like, you can probably tell I'm so excited and proud of you guys. It's like, whew. About time. Now, the other topic that's on my mind is Access-on-Demand. Your annual operating budget is $1.32 billion. And if you're thinking about equity and 20% of the population, roughly, a little more, little less, are people with disabilities, then 20% of that operating budget is closer to $264 million, and Access-on-Demand isn't anywhere close to that. I don't think either one of these recommendations to the Board makes sense at all, and I would encourage you to look at it again. I mean, the numbers keep changing, by the way, for the subsidies, $16 to now $22 for Access-on-Demand. Now it's 100 for Access-a-Ride. And why not think-- like, Einstein said you can get from point A to B with logic, but you can get everywhere with your imagination. What if you applied the Access-on-Demand model to Access-a-Ride using those vehicles? You could start with a little pilot and see how it worked. You could even use it to pick up other people. There's no prohibition from other people using those paratransit vehicles, and most of the time they're sitting in a parking lot with a driver sleeping. So of course, I haven't seen that. But I've been told--",

The comment was made during public participation earlier. Highlands Ranch has access to rail. At the risk of being struck by lightning for contesting the testimony of a Reverend, Highlands Ranch does not have access to rail. The Southwest rail extension, what I affectionately refer to as the SWRE is one of the unfinished corridors of FasTracks. My successor, as District H Director, made a reference to that in the special meeting earlier today, many hours ago. The legislature, at the urging of the governor, only prioritize service for the Northwest Rail, with no reference to the Southwest Rail extension, the SWRE. I must confess that I must have been an inadequate voice on behalf of the SWRE. I apologize to my former constituents, and can only hope that my successor, as Vice Chair of this Board, will be more impactful. That said, kudos to all of you for proceeding with the steps toward Northwest Rail completion.

There's an article on your website, but it is my opinion that RTD needs to be as loud as possible with this. It's a sad fact that the majority of people in the metro don't ride transit, and we need to yell to get news like this out, because it's hard for it to spread with light announcements and word of mouth. We have lost, as of 2024, 21.6% of E line riders and 31.4% of H line riders. And not only is that a massive hit to the light rail system, but it bleeds to the rest of the system by people not being able to make those transfers. We saw ridership decreases on all three of our rail lines last year. And it's just, Directors making Reddit posts just really isn't enough. Could we maybe give two weeks of free fares to try and really get eyes back on the system to try and really make an effort to undo this ridership destruction that we've seen on our light rail? And especially on the Southeast corridor. Thank you. That's my time.",

    "text": "Richard Bamber: Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight. I'd like to talk about the Title VI changes, which are up for approval tonight. GBT is generally in support of these changes, although we know a yes vote, needs to be carried out against the backdrop that a review of the methodology is needed in the medium term. Currently, RTD's only reliable data source uses Census data about what sort of populations demographics live in certain neighborhoods. So we make lots of effort to ensure service outside the front doors of equity populations is sufficiently good that they're not left behind when service is improved and they're not unfairly targeted when service has to be cut. However, this approach only assumes equity populations only travel locally within the communities they reside. A good transit network can level up communities and spread wealth across its entire metro area. There's no point in running 15 minute frequency buses past the doorsteps of a low income or BIPOC community if they then have to transfer onto another bus which runs every 60 minutes and drops you a mile away from that well-paying employer. The current Title VI process fails to consider how a local transit network either succeeds or fails to service equity populations effectively, and it is because it considers the routes basically in silos. And this is why, while we support the Title VI, we support the agency's efforts, we believe that it could be made a much more effective process if new data sources are considered and the methodology is reviewed. Thank you very much for letting me speak tonight.",

    "text": "Jo Elizabeth Pinto: Thank you. I would like to talk quickly about two issues. The first is the Rockies Ride. My family went to the Rockies game last week, and we looked up how to get there on the RTD website, and there's a whole page dedicated to the Rockies Ride. But when we got to the stop, there were no buses, no people, no cars, no nothing. So we called the RTD, 299-6000, and the woman laughed and said, oh, we haven't had those buses for years. So the RTD needs to take down the Rockies Ride info from its website if it is no longer running those services, and it needs to keep its website updated about the services that are provided because people depend on that website to be accurate. The other thing that I need to talk about is Access-on-Demand. And my issue is that when you look at the Access-on-Demand and when you are talking about cutting services-- which, again, if we are 20% to 25% of the population that have disabilities, a little more, a little less, like Ms. Folska said, the idea to cut services based on the RTD schedule will leave people with no services on the weekends if the bus doesn't run on weekends to that part of the service area, or at night, or if they live more than 3/4 of a mile from a bus stop. And that will leave people stranded. And people with disabilities go places after 5 o'clock. They go places on the weekends. They go places. They don't just go to doctors that are open in the daytime. They go to shows, they go to restaurants, they go to malls on the weekends. They go all the same places you do. And it becomes really difficult when they get stranded in their homes except from 9:00 to 5:00, weekdays. So just take that into consideration when you make these cuts and imagine people who are disabled going to the same places you do, and imagine being stranded at home because you cut so that they can only go from 9:00 to 5:00 on weekdays. Also--",

I'm Tim Keenan. I'm a totally blind user of Access-on-Demand, and I live in Baker and work a fluctuating schedule out at Amazon in Aurora, which includes night and overnight shifts. So if you were to follow any of these recommendations, me and people like me, because I know there are a lot of people with disabilities who work out there, would not be able to use Access-on-Demand for at least one leg of their trip. In my case, that would eat into my paycheck by close to a third. And when you look at the numbers here, Access-on-Demand is probably the most efficient of your services. With fixed routes costing $19 per boarding, Access-on-Demand at $16 and Access-a-Ride at $60. So this is really working well, and to cut it, I think you need to decide whether this is in fact sustainable. I know there was-- the use was just blowing up and people got worried, and so they commissioned this review and all that. But really, it's helping a lot of people, and at 1.13% of your annual budget, it sounds pretty sustainable to me. Now, all that said, I don't know anyone who wouldn't-- I don't know anybody who would be against paying a fare. So if you add a $4.50 fare and that's $2.8 million of savings from the current numbers. That's doing something to put more money back into the system. And we certainly don't mind paying our way. But to cut the area in hours is going to leave some people who don't even have bus service in their area anymore, but used to, it's going to leave those people totally stranded without any kind of affordable transit option. So my ask would be that you keep the limit at 60 trips a month. This allows full time workers, 40 trips, and then 20 trips to do whatever they want or need to do. Get groceries and participate in the community. Maintain the current service area and hours so you're not creating transit deserts, and implement pricing that's fair that stays constant at $4.50 or $2.25 for RTD live that doesn't punish people for taking more trips like a tiered system would do, and it also doesn't have the added overhead that that system would have. So basically you can keep the program as it is now, add a fare, and keep this program doing what it does best, which is connect people with disabilities with their community.",

Hopefully we're down the home stretch here in terms of finding a sustainable path forward for Access-on-Demand that still maintains this robust level of service and utility for the district residents that cannot use a fixed route service independently. I implore you to recognize a few facts that are in the staff's presentation that you're going to-- the public's going to hear tonight and that was in the agenda packet for this meeting and for the operations meeting a couple weeks ago. And there's some unanswered questions that you may already have as Board members, information that you should definitely, in my opinion, make sure as you're making decisions about the future of this program. In the agenda packet, it already talks about how the cost of an Access trip is just a fraction of the cost of a traditional access ride service. And I don't know if there has been any effort made to see if it's possible to try to encourage people to use Access-on-Demand instead of Access-a-Ride, if people are fully aware of the capabilities of it, if people are aware of how to use it, converting a few of those access ride trips to Access-on-Demand could yield significant savings in this whole process. Also, it's worth pointing out that you're more than doubling the number of trips provided to people who cannot use fixed route service with Access-on-Demand, as opposed to Access-a-Ride. That's a success. You're helping people make connections, get around, participate in the workforce, participate in society. As we've heard people talk about, shop, go out and get some entertainment, whether it's movies or music or what have you. Things have become possible with this program. Some of the answered questions in these proposals is in the tiered fare concept, it talks about needing to hire additional staff. Perhaps this is already going to be discussed later tonight, but it's not clear what that staff would do. And it's hard to fathom what would need to be added to-- what would need to be handled by added staff that couldn't be automated, couldn't be handled with a spreadsheet wizard and a knowledge of how to write some stuff in SQL. There are ways to gather a lot of different data and process a lot of numbers, analyze the numbers to make that tiered fare approach work. So it'd be good to know what those new hires would need to do. Both proposals call for cutting back, as we've talked about, the service area hours back to match Access-a-Ride. This isn't required as a supplemental premium service. Access-on-Demand doesn't have to line up with Access-a-Ride. That is a choice that's made. What's the question is, how would Access-a-Ride enforce the restricted hours proposed and contained both these plans because when the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado has spoken with RTD staff before, we've been told that, yes, geofencing to define the boundaries can be done.",

    "text": "Cody Bair: Good evening and thank you RTD Board. I am also here to talk about Access-a-Ride-- Access-on-Demand service, and have spoken about the topic at a few meetings before. Tonight I want to say that I agree with you what Dr. Folska and Tim Keenan said about this. Access-on-Demand cost is really a fraction of RTD's budget. At just 1.13% and just north of, I think $10 million, this is not a huge opportunity for RTD to save significantly on the budget and would be a huge loss of service for many Coloradoans in the RTD district with disabilities. Speaking to the current proposals that are out there. With the tiered proposal, one thing that I would urge the RTD Board to think about and questions to ask would be, how would we actually enforce the fares of the tiered proposal? This service is offered amongst Uber, Lyft, and a couple of other taxi platforms, neither of which share information or communicate with each other at all. To that point, even in the current system as a user, if I want to see how many trips I've used, I have to open each platform and count the number that have been taken in the month on that platform. I just don't see an administratively effective way to make the fare thing work without putting that burden on the rider, which would inherently cause issues for people keeping track of it. Second, to follow up on Nate's comments about the hours. You look at somebody who's a full time employee at Amazon like Tim and many others who would be affected by this, that's taking-- by cutting people's ability to use the service, we're taking tax revenue out of the Colorado economy. I'm not sure that that's something that makes a lot of sense for RTD. And people have built their lives around being able to access this service in its current state and any reduction and change of the service area or hours is a reduction in service, in my mind, and something that I would completely be against. Appreciate your guys' time tonight, and that concludes my comments.",

    "text": "Maryann Migliorelli: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for your time and your attention. Tonight I would like to speak to you briefly about equity and the Access-on-Demand system and in RTD in general. We have been told by RTD members that we cannot have the multiple stop situation because that would not be equitable. We have been told that we can have certain things, but we can't have others. One of the things that we are now being told is that with this tiered system, we can have inequity in pricing. There is no place in the RTD system where riding more costs more per trip. This does not happen on Access-a-Ride. It does not happen anywhere in the fixed route system, on any light rail, on any bus. As a matter of fact, RTD went out of its way to remove the barriers to regional transit by removing the price barrier. But with the ideas of this tiered system, we are saying-- and you would be saying if you approve it-- that anybody who does more than 30 trips per month should have to pay more in order to use a system. That, ladies and gentlemen, is inequity. And that is not something that RTD should even have been entertaining that proposal. But you will do what is necessary, and I will thank you for the hard work that is involved in keeping our program alive. The other thought is in removing and putting the boundaries in that are the same for Access-a-Ride, there are many people who will be affected whose life plans, the places they live, the places they work, the places they choose to do business and entertain will all be affected. People have been provided a service, have been able to make these decisions about their lives because of the service that is provided, and taking service away creates further inequity and transit deficits. That is not something RTD should be looking for doing, and I sincerely hope that in every way that you can, you find a way to keep the Access-on-Demand program as open as it is right now. I personally do not know anybody who would object to paying the 4.50 or 2.25 fare as proposed. But adding additional fares and cutting service will make transit deficits that should not be considered. Right now, this program is moving people who have never had a chance to participate in public transit life in the way that we can right now. Please consider this when you're making your decisions. Thank you so much for your time and those who remember me before, if I was there, I would bring you warm chocolate cookies.",

And as indicated in your remarks, sir, we are here referencing the previous agendized topic at the Operations Safety and Security Committee that we did not get to and wanted to have this conversation with you all this evening. The intent of this presentation is to ground all Board members in our paratransit programs. But more specifically, what we are seeking from this body is some guidance relative to Access-on-Demand, which is a supplemental premium service as it relates to paratransit services, not the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 complementary paratransit services. And in doing so, this conversation will help us guide our path forward. Specifically, I think what's notable for everybody to understand that the current paratransit contracts that we have for Access-on-Demand do sunset at the end of December. We have had conversations relative to modifications. In absence of having some guidance, we run the risk of not having any type of services, and hence why it's so imperative is that we adhere to open and fair competition. In order to do a solicitation relative to services, we have to have some guidance relative to the specifications that would be included in a solicitation for a request for proposal. So this is not for you to make a decision relative to where we are, but provide guidance, because what we anticipate doing with said guidance and bringing forward these scenarios after meeting with some board members, i.e. Chair Ruscha and Director Chandler, that are both on the Operation Safety and Security Committee, is to seek that direction so we can then go out to the customer segments and garner a better understanding. While we've heard comments here, we have taken part in a myriad of different public participation engagements and want to ensure that we are being good fiscal stewards, but also ensuring that we are providing the independence and ability for all aspects of our population to be able to travel and move about to and fro. So with that being said, I will yield the floor to Ms. Vallejos to commence with the presentation. If we could have Board Office staff pull that up, that would be appreciated. Thank you.",

    "text": "Erin Vallejos: Of course. OK, so just to highlight on this, again, as GM/CEO Johnson said. Access-a- Ride and Access-on-Demand are the two programs that we have. Access-a-Ride is RTD's federally required ADA complementary paratransit service. It does supplement our fixed route services. There is a fare payment required for these services and customers must meet the criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to be eligible. This is provided with all RTD branded Access-a-Ride vehicles that are all 100% accessible. And then Access-on-Demand is our supplemental premium paratransit service. It is a curb-to-curb taxi and rideshare service. It is available to current paratransit customers, so they must meet those eligibility criteria to qualify for Access-a-Ride to then use Access-on-Demand. And as it stands today, RTD pays the first $25 of the trip and the remaining portion is paid by the customer. And again, ability today to take 60 total trips. So just some quick operating statistics. The annual operating cost in 2024 for Access-a-Ride was just over 53 million, and the customer trips were just over 500,000. And again, these are RTD owned vehicles, and the contractors that operate this service have over 500 drivers, mechanics, and other staff. And then Access-on-Demand. Last year it was about just over $15.3 million for the budget. Just over 685,000 trips. And these are all provided by third party vehicles. So again, as we touched on, you must be eligible for Access-a-Ride to also use Access-on-Demand. There is a process that customers must go through that determines if a customer has a disabling condition that would prevent them from using our regular fixed route service. There's an application process, a medical verification process, and then an in-person assessment that customers must complete. And there are a couple of different types of eligibility that a customer could receive. Unconditional means you can have access to the full service for up to four years. Temporary. You might have a condition that's going to improve, recovering from surgery or something along those lines. And then conditional would be when there was something-- maybe you're sensitive to extreme hot or extreme cold, so you would be able to use it at those times, but not the full year. OK. And as we have touched on, this is something that you've probably seen as well. We are continuing to see an increase in Access-on-Demand usage. This is through 2024, but we continue to see that Access- on-Demand trend line going up into the start of this year. And Access-a-Ride, when you look at the trend line, while it is staying a little bit more stable, we are still seeing an increase in usage there as well. And as we've talked about, average monthly trips per customer. The majority of customers are falling into the category of taking up to 50 trips. That is about 90% of the customers when we last did the analysis, and about 10% of the customers again fall into that 51 to 60 category. So now I'm going to just remind everyone of what our initial recommendations were back in 2024. As it stands today again, quickly, there's a $0 base customer fare. The trip cap is 60 per month. Subsidy is up to $25 per trip. It is available within the entire district and it is available 24/7. Back when we came to you in November of 2024, we had proposed making changes, and this involved having a $4.50 base customer fare, which would be $2.25 for our LiVE eligible customers. We proposed a trip cap of $40 per month. The subsidy would go to $20 per trip, and then it was proposed to mirror both the current service area and the service hours. With this recommendation, there were going to be cost savings that the District would realize, and that was going to be about $5.8 million. So instead of the projected yearly spend being a little bit over 15 million, we would go down to about 9.4. OK, and as a result of some of the feedback and comments that we've heard, we did put together two additional revised scenarios. So scenario one is what I'm going to touch on first. So this has to do with an increased trip cap approach. So what we were proposing in this scenario is increasing the trip cap to 50 per month from the original 40 that was proposed. We are proposing as this is, again, as we've said, a premium supplemental service, a fare of $6.50 per trip, which would be $3.25 for our LiVE customers. Then the remainder of the proposal does remain the same. We were still proposing a subsidy per trip of $20, and we are proposing mirroring the current service area and service hours as that of our Access-a-Ride program. With this program, we did see actually a little bit of the yearly impact would be a cost savings of about 6.1 million, bringing our total spend to about a little over 9.1. With the 50 trips, that does allow for customers to still have-- given there's about 20 week days in a month that does allow for customers to still travel to work, but then does allow for some ancillary trips throughout the month. And then another scenario that we had put together is the tiered approach that we have discussed. With this approach, we would still maintain a trip cap of up to 60 trips per month, which matches what we have currently. There would be a $4.50 base customer fare for up to 30 trips, $5.50 for 31 to 50, and $6.50 for 51 to 60. And the remainder of the recommendation would remain the same. With this program, as some people have noted, due to the program structure and some of the manual aspects that exist with monitoring today, there would be a pretty big an increase in staff oversight that would result in additional staff headcount. Again, that had been noted, but as it stands today, the program does require quite a bit of manual intervention. There is also, as someone mentioned, the customers would need to be keeping a little bit closer track of their trips, and that could lead to confusion. It is something a customer would have to be regularly thinking, all right, where am I at for the month? Have I hit that 30 trips? So they know what to expect for their costs. With this program, we would see some reductions of just over $5 million. So it is a little bit less than some of the other recommendations that we've put forth, and it would bring our projected yearly spend to about $10.28 million a year. Oh, and actually. So proposed next steps. We are here, as GM/CEO Johnson has said, to just garner everyone's feedback and get some guidance on a path forward. The intent is to do outreach and engagement in June based on some of that guidance and engage with the community. We would be coming back for Board consideration in July with an actual recommended action to the committee, and then provided the committee advanced it at the Board meeting. And we would begin implementation in August with full implementation in October. And with that, I will open it up.",

    "text": "Chris Nicholson: Thank you very much. I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said. We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway. They're our commuter routes, and I would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within 3/4 of a mile of those routes. So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity. Otherwise Peggy has two places in her district that get service, and that's just not reasonable. There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas. I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of-- not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County, when it comes to AOD, are very different than the needs of central Denver. I can get to most places that I need to go, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber. I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for $15 in Peggy's district, or yours. Exactly. But creating a system where the trip cap is $40 doesn't work for me. Creating a trip cap where it's $15 doesn't work for the people in her district. It strikes me that the right approach would be to have different levels of financial cap and different levels of trip cap to go along with them and let people pick. You want 60 trips at $15 per? Great. You want 50 trips at $20 per? Great. You want 40 trips at $30 per? Great. Depends on where you live, depends on the types of trips you're going to be taking. But making people all fit into one size is either going to leave her people paying $20 for every single trip that they take, or it's going to put people in my district in a reduced number of rides, because very few trips are going to cost $20 or $25. Those are my two pieces of feedback. Thank you.",

So we need to assess that, because it's a different level of service. Because with fixed route bus, we're not providing curb to curb service. And so we can double back and share that information with the Board, but I think it wouldn't be fruitful for us to guesstimate because this is critically important.

    "text": "Michael Guzman: I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area. District C is fairly blessed with multiple forms of transit and fixed route where this is not a particular problem, but it is an issue in the suburban areas of the region. And it is highly concerning that we would restrict it so much where people would be left off of the system that live within a quarter mile of a commuter bus, and still not be able to access this. I also think that as we proceed into the future after the demographer's presentation to the Finance and Planning Committee, a big concern will be our aging population in the region. And somebody said that this is a drop in the bucket for our budget. Maybe right now, but eventually, this is going to catch up with us, which is why we're having this conversation. And Access-on-Demand and folks that are able to, or out of need, utilize this system need to be considered as humans first and how we serve them, which is our mission. They need connection as well, and not every one of them will be able to jump from a-- jump, roll, walk, shuffle to a fixed route form of transportation to get them to their destinations. I have a question about the time on this. If it's mirroring regular service provision for the whole region, it kind of makes sense. But I would still be concerned for the reasons that emergencies don't happen on RTD's schedule. And so somebody who already has a specific need for this type of transportation usage might need to go to the doctor. And what do they do if they're unable to drive. And regular bus service is not something that they can use because the buses aren't running? At 2 o'clock in the morning, emergency room visit is not unheard of and not uncommon in anybody's life. And yet, what do we do to take care of those that are most vulnerable? So for me, I would really want to see some clarity around those two areas. I am frankly less concerned about minimal difference of cost savings. I mean, we're talking $5 million. This is not really the top priority for me on that part right now. It will eventually get there because this will likely continue to grow. But I do want to make sure that we are basing ourselves in reality to serve the taxpayers' needs. And this is a need. This is not a desire, as some of the other services we want to grow and create are. This one is an actual need. And so I want to be clear in my language on that and why I'm depositing these comments within that framework. So that would be my feedback. I'd like to see something a little bit different on those two things, the service area and the time for service. Thank you.",

I represent Arvada, and Arvada is actually the fastest growing aging population. However I said that, I'm not sure I said it right. And a lot of our service is not in the areas where we have those aging people. So I'd really like to see just the boundary kept the same. I'm also really, again, with Director Guzman, keeping it at a full 24/7. I have a friend in a wheelchair and I just think about her trying-- like if she didn't live where she lived, if she lived where I lived, she would have such a difficult time getting around her community. And I would just-- especially if the service is outside of that time period, it's just precluding her life. I know we don't all have the same abilities when we're riding a bus, but for a person with disability that's blind or in a wheelchair, I think that we can extend them the grace that they deserve. I also would like to see the cap stay at 60. I think that, again, I know that less than 10% of the population go above the 50 rides. But I think it's still, we're giving them access to a free and full life. And I think if we are going to go the 6.50, I think that that, to me is fine. But I also think that it would be imperative that we really put out the LiVE program and let those riders know that there is another option. I was with someone the other day. She lives about 3 miles away from where she works, and she can afford it, but just barely. And she didn't know about the LiVE program. So I think that we're missing an opportunity there specifically with these riders. And then my last one is just a request. Is it possible to get a map, sort of like a density map, of where AOD is highly being used? To go with that thinking about West Jefferson County versus central Denver, just kind see what that looks like. Obviously, we want to anonymize the data, but I think it just would be interesting for us to know where the hotspots of usage are. Thank you.",

So anyway, so some of this feedback I did share with staff and I don't want to be repetitive, but I also just want to be really transparent with my colleagues because we haven't had this public conversation yet. And just high level, some of the things that I had shared was, first of all, we don't want to put one proposal out before the community and get feedback, like the one that we've had out for several months, and then come back with something else that looks like less than what we originally proposed. And so one of the pain points that I had was just the idea of going up to 6.50 for the initial fare, because that's not what we originally put out there. So one of the things that I urge is that if we put an offer on the table, so to speak, we don't take it back. That's our baseline now. And another piece of feedback I had is that where something is not-- for every change we make, which essentially results in a reduction of a service of some kind or an increase in price, we really have to justify that line by line. So, for example, if we decide that we are going to strictly align with service hours, then we have to justify it. It doesn't cost us any more money. It's not going to save us a penny if somebody uses on-Demand 15 or 20 minutes or an hour before fixed route starts. Likewise, it's not costing us, that I could see, a lot of money, if any, for us to offer service outside of our general service area. I know that was flagged in the peer review. Because this idea has been on the table for so many months, I also want to caution us about the service area idea, because if we restrict this service, that means there are people who currently are using AOD and they're going to lose it. I mean, that was just a kind of high level theme that I had in the feedback. And also, I going back to the initial affair, we also want to be really careful about what we think is inexpensive, because it's really relative. So for some folks using this service and they have a fixed income or very limited income, if we even do 4.50, which would be parity with Access-a-Ride-- and I think I could accept that. But say we go up to 6.50 or we do this tiered system, then for some folks they are not going to be able to ride or they're going to be choosing, do I get to the doctor or do I buy food for tonight. So I just wanted to put that out there. And finally-- well, actually, I'll stop there. I concurred with what a lot of other Directors said in terms of keeping the program as-is as much as we can, But I also just want to commend staff, because we are at a much different place than where we were several months ago. This was a totally different conversation. We're talking about really slashing this program, and staff did a lot of work and we spent several months. We almost voted on this a few months ago, and they listened to us as Directors and they listened to community because, as you know, we've had hundreds of public comments over several months on this. And they said, OK, we can take a timeout, we can reassess, we can get some different data. We can present a new paradigm. So again, what's before us today is a sketch of ideas. The feedback is good, but I really do want to commend staff for listening and working with us in partnership. So thank you and thank you.",

So yeah, as a first thing, I would say that since we're going to be updating this to offer the LiVE discount and not make it free, it should be required as part of the process if you're going through to sign up for AOD or AAR, some point in that process, to ask someone to affirm that they are either already signed up or haven't signed up or whatever. And then give them the opportunity. Make it super easy because we only have 15,000 people signed up for LiVE right now, and we have 180 something thousand boardings every day. And I think only about half the people in AOD are currently signed up for-- or AAR are currently signed up for LiVE. So definitely something I'd like to see there. The second thing. I want to echo what Director Ruscha said about the effect on people who are low income to having these fares. But I want to take it from the other side, which is if you don't have a lot of money and you need to get around to a lot of places, then 40 trips may be, or whatever the number ends up being, not nearly enough in a way that someone who makes more money can probably have some discretionary to be like, oh, I've run out of trips. I can afford to take an extra three or five or whatever. So I'm not sure that needs to be fit into the policy here. I'm wary about trying to do too much too quickly. But I do think we need to get a report from you after, I don't know, six months, a year, that looks at how many trips are people on LiVE using. Are they maxing out? Or are we seeing the same curve from LiVE users as we do from regular users right now? And that might inform us to take action a year from now to try to offer the right service for people who need it. Some LiVE people make decent incomes, some of them are literally broke. And we need to recognize that those two groups of people have very different lived experiences.",

So that's a critical element when we're talking about the population, because there's different disabilities that individuals have. Some may have cognitive. Somebody may be using a mobility device which can't be accommodated going forward.

We had extensive public comments, the most I've ever seen at any OSS meeting. That was great. Come visit us anytime. It's always nice to know that people are listening to our podcast, and by that I mean our YouTube channel. But two major items that went on the consent calendar for tonight's meeting. Is the 2025, 2028 Title VI program update. Just ensuring that we stay in compliance with federal law, Civil Rights protections, and meet the needs of our customers, as well as the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension. F&P authorized a budget transfer which had no financial impact. It was just moving from one department to another. And then we followed that up with a vote to extend that contract for another year, with the cost of up to just a little over 22 million. And we did have four discussion items, two of which were heard. So we had the Vision Zero update from GM CEO Johnson. As you might recall, we passed a Vision Zero resolution last year and so that planning process is underway. We had a customer communications update. Stuart Summers led an excellent presentation discussing how we handle communications, some tech updates, customer service aspects. It was real-time information and service alerts and things like that. Unfortunately, we did hit our four hour mark before we could finish our agenda items. And even though the Nuggets weren't playing, folks wanted to go and we were tired. So we moved the on-Demand item to tonight's meeting, which we just heard. And then we'll be hearing paratransit legacy customer protections proposal next month. So for those of you who have been tracking what we're doing with paratransit, I strongly encourage you to come visit us at OSS next month and weigh in so we get your feedback before we come back with something more final. Our next meeting is Wednesday, June 11 at 5:30. Same time, same place, online or on the phone. Thank you.",

I've received some feedback. I continue to invite Directors to submit their feedback. If you have not reviewed that meeting, please do so, and any questions you may have, please email me or call me. I am happy to engage in that conversation. Of course, we are doing that with participation and a lot of communication with the General Manager/CEO, Debra Johnson. The next meeting of the Performance Committee is scheduled for June 2, 2025 at 8:30 AM. I really want to encourage all of you Directors to please participate in that meeting. Two reasons. One, we are going to receive-- I hope I don't get this wrong because I don't have my work plan in front of me, but the employee survey results in the beginning of that meeting, and then we will adjourn into executive session for the second quarterly one-on-one opportunity with our General Manager/CEO. And that is part of our contracted agreement with the General Manager/CEO to receive information from her and provide feedback regarding personnel matters. Additionally, the Performance Committee is set to have a second meeting in June because of that quarterly check-in. The second meeting is planned, I believe, for June 23 at 8:30 AM, and that is in order to do a deep dive into our community and customer surveys, which align with our community value and customer excellence strategic initiatives. And I would again encourage all Directors to participate in that meeting as well, which is the overview of the current status of the agency's surveys and where we're at with regard to public. It will inform the process for setting goals and priorities for the 2026 year which we are also doing all at the same time. So prioritizing what is important for our customers, the survey reports are a great opportunity to engage with direct feedback from our constituents in all areas of the agency. And I do believe a little birdie has told me on one of the buses that these should be really positive discussions. So if you need more than that invitation, please signal tonight and I will call you and email you and hound you to be on these meetings, because I think they're really important for all of us.

    "text": "Debra Johnson: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And to recognize the lateness of the hour, I just have a couple elements that I'll share with you that are in alignment with our activities and strategic endeavors since our last Board meeting on Tuesday, April 29. One notable aspect is the legislative conference held by the American Public Transportation Association from May 18th to the 20th in Washington, DC. Just for everyone's edification, this annual conference is an opportunity for Public Transportation industry professionals across the nation to visit Washington, DC and connect with policymakers, implementers, and their staffs. The conference helps educate and inform APTA members on important federal legislation and policy initiatives, and affords an unparalleled opportunity to shape the industry's positions in federal advocacy agenda. I, along with Directors O'Keefe, Chandler, and Gutschenritter, and Government Relations Officer Michael Davies, attended conference sessions and meetings with members of Colorado's congressional delegation and their staffs. While chairing an APTA committee meeting on Sunday, May 8, I personally engaged with Tariq Bokhari, who is the acting administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, who shared his views and inputs as it relates to public transit, as well as the importance of federal and local partnerships. Just yesterday, Tuesday, May 27, I, along with members of my team, met with individuals representing the alliance to transform transportation. As you may be aware, it's a coalition of groups on transit related matters in Colorado. Alliance representatives in attendance included executive Director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Danny Katz, or CPIRG, as we refer to it. Jill Cantor, Executive Director of the Denver Streets Partnership. Portia Prescott, Present of the Rocky Mountain NAACP branch of the State Conference representing Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. Dennis Hawkins, representing the Amalgamated Transit Union 1001. Matt Fromer, representing transportation and land use. Well, he is the Transportation and Land Use Policy Manager from the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. The meeting really was focused on alliance's vision for transit in the Denver region. As you know, they have been very vocal in which they're seeking to increase funding for transit in the Denver region by $420 million per year to bolster the frequency and availability of transit services in the metro area. From RTD's perspective, questions were posed relative to how that $420 million figure was derived, and they explained how that came about with the work they had done with the third party entity. Very bare bones relative to providing some information. And then we talked about the agency's focus, which all of you are very well aware that we are laser focused on asset renewal, state of good repair, and rightsizing transit service in alignment with RTD's branded comprehensive operational analysis being the System Optimization Plan. Related to personal security. As was recently reported, RTD experienced a 60% reduction in security related calls for service, as well as a three year decrease in reports of criminal activities between 2022 and 2025 at Denver Union Station. The decrease is representative of concerted efforts to restore and maintain a welcoming transit environment within the critical multi-modal transit hub and following a collaborative and multifaceted strategy aimed at enhancing personal safety and security through crime prevention through environmental design methodologies. This effort would have not have been a success without the commitment of numerous agency employees, as well as support from the City and County of Denver, its police department, the Downtown Denver Partnership, Sage Hospitality, the Lower Denver Neighborhood Association, as well as several local businesses in downtown Denver residents. Fare enforcement has also increased in recent months, which is the result of RTD's growing ranks of sworn police officers having been trained to perform this function alongside the contracted team that we have in security with Allied Universal personnel who had primarily been responsible for this responsibility. I look forward to sharing additional details regarding the impacts of these efforts during the June Performance Committee, which you heard committee Chair Guzman reference when I, along with staff, will present data related to annual customer, community, and employee surveys that have recently concluded. On a related note, the agency has proactively increased its transit police officer presence at Denver Union Station and across the agency's downtown Denver sector to support the personal safety and security of customers and visitors attending major events and activity. Notably, while we're no longer in the hockey playoffs and NBA, but people had a welcoming experience in and around our facilities, and RTD PD had increased patrols at Denver Union Station and bus stops and rail stations before the high profile events, which included the playoff games I just referenced. And this coincides with increasing Denver Police patrols throughout the Downtown area. And RTD and DPD are working closely to collaborate to support enhanced safety for the traveling public. And moreover, data and metrics related to personal safety and Security are now conveniently located on the recently created security related metrics page, and we've actually showcased that on other social media channels as well. As it relates to our customer excellence in relation to the strategic priorities of customer excellence and employee ownership, I shared yesterday with the Board the last of the 31 light rail speed restrictions put into place last year on the D, H, and E and R lines was lifted as of yesterday morning. I want to give a special shout out to our Maintenance of Way teams that have done yeoman's work. The final speed restriction, which was approximately 400 feet in the southbound segment north of Southmoor Station, was removed after crews completed those repairs. Keeping in mind those rigorous restrictions were put into place due to the fact that we enhanced our inspections of track back in May 2024 as an enhanced focus on maintaining the agency's assets in a state of good repair. At the time, crews found several minor issues and track imperfections. So, as I said before, I thank and congratulate all the agency employees who work tire-- I'm tired-- tirelessly over the course of these 11 months. And like I said, a special shout out to MOW. I would be remiss if I didn't state that while this is a cause to celebrate, I shared previously, as we look at our infrastructure and it continues to age, this will be par for the course. But since we're ahead of where we were before, we will see less of an impact, I'm certain. And last, but certainly not least, I'm pleased to welcome RTD's new Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who's in the audience. She's giving a wave. Who began her tenure on May 12. And this is her first in-person Board meeting. While we introduced her at the Finance and Planning Committee, you guys are real people, not figments of our imagination, so I wanted to ensure I did that here. So with that, I will yield the floor so we can move on to the rest of the matters that we have before us. So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.",

I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during the pandemic. And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations come out. And so I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic and perhaps do it a little bit quicker and also try to make it not quite so difficult. So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the City and County of Broomfield. And their transportation staff went through our items quite closely, and they sent us all a letter with recommended changes. So I've gone through with their changes, and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the Board, see what your thoughts are. Hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see what happens. But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large transit agencies. And so I did send you also a copy of the City and County of Broomfield's letter, just to refresh your memory.

That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there, this is not correct relative to where we sit. And more specifically, I do know our Director of Civil Rights, when we were going through this, quite naturally in the role that he is in, he and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies.

To expand upon the response, I just also want to ground us and first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes. And in doing that audit, we looked at 22-- rather, 23 different organizations, which includes the four, MARTA, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority. And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right? And ours is stacked in the middle. So I want to give you some numbers here. So for the four that I just mentioned, MARTA has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%. And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, 6 out of that 23 have 5% or less. Two have 8%. Six, which includes us, or seven including us, is at 10%. Three at 15%. And then three at 20%. And in my over eight years of doing this work, I'll just say that when you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve specifically with Title VI. Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service. There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth. This is just a mechanism for the agencies such as RTD and the Board of Directors so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant. So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.",

    "text": "Debra Johnson: Yes, thank you very much. Director Benker, that question is better suited for me. Relative to the service delivery framework that we have, while Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy services based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours. But more specifically, at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP. When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were-- 85% of what service levels were in 2019. We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward. What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious in how we're applying service, because we do want to ensure there is equity. I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well. As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change. That is up to the Board, quite naturally. But I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service, keeping in mind that all transit agencies across the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power. Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio. What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and in the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio. We've deviated from that and have a waiver, and we're rightsizing the fleet as we move forward. So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory, or were, and we're coming back from that. We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area, from an origin and destination vantage point, just by virtue of how our service area is going forward. So I'm not providing this to say I don't understand what you're trying to do, and as I share it with you, I do clearly, and we want to work within the framework that we have. But a wholesale of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible. And I say it from the vantage point of we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour, but that was out on the street. Does that really yield the return on investment going forward? Hence that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services going forward.",

When we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate in the lack of people commuting in, it's important to keep in mind that there was-- I'm forgetting the name, but the City and County of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the occupancy levels. But more specifically, what's important to note is that there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to the central business district. I believe the last time I looked at stats, City and County of Denver was in the bottom three out of 50 major cities. And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number-- is the third state relative to remote work and then city of Boulder is number one. While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic. How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before? I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair, and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery. And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power, we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available were people whereby were working extra shifts, and then we didn't have enough people for daily pull out on those other routes. And so I'm providing that context to say, to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do. But to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging, just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of this agency's.",

So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as the policy. But with respect to the circular, we can, i.e. the Board of Directors could adopt a different threshold. So, for example, the one that Director Benker has put forth. Although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update, there is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the Board is ultimately approving the policy.",

I guess my basic question is with regard to this update and the changes that we're proposing. I mean, is there really a problem here? Are we just making this harder for ourselves? Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact, one place or the other. We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons, and on balance they don't really seem to, under our current setup, ever, ever look like they were somehow some bad intent or just inattention to who we are serving. It seems we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have done anyways. So why put a greater burden, regulate ourselves more than we have to?

I just didn't-- from what I read in the packet, I don't know if I caught everything, but it didn't seem like there were a lot of those. Or is this happening at an earlier stage where when Bob and service says, let's just send a bunch of buses to Cherry Hills Village, somebody says, no, no, that's not going to work out, before it even gets to this point.

Since January 2023, there was about 270 service change recommendations that have been implemented, and roughly 24-26 of those 276 were considered major service changes. And out of that 26, to Director Larsen's point, there has been 13 potential disparate impacts. And to your point, there was a substantial legitimate justification. I wouldn't necessarily couch it as an exercise, but I would say we work, the Transit Equity Office within the Civil Rights Division, works hand in glove with Jessie Carter and his team, Service Development. And as we are having those conversations after the service change recommendation are put forth and we analyze it, if there is a potential disparate impact, more often than not, to your point and to my earlier earlier point, that Title VI is not a stopping mechanism. And I wouldn't necessarily state that it's burdensome because it's one of our responsibilities to make sure that we are equitably distributing services across our service area. But more often than not, there is a legitimate justification to put forth the service recommendation as it is presented to the Board.",

What I'm going to say goes back to the previous comments that I had before, recognizing that RTD is a regional service, and the way the service was outlined, for all intents and purposes, was bringing individuals into the central business district. That level of ridership isn't there. And that's not to negate that there is some elements centered on a need to move people to and fro. Hence, that's why there was the advent of the partnership program and one of the reasons why Erie basically wanted to join the district, because they were looking to put forward an application for the partnership program. And I know you're just using that as an example, but just wanted to further iterate that, because for all intents and purposes, as we're looking to provide mobility options, the intent behind the partnership program was more or less like a pilot in the sense that let's see how many people are utilizing this means of connection prior to putting out a 40 foot or 60 foot R tick that costs more money per revenue hour and doesn't yield the same return on investment relative to the cost per boarding.

It is simply a filter through which to look, if I understand this correctly, that we are not unintentionally harming community with protected status under the Title VI legislation, or those that might be disproportionately burdened or impacted by their financial and economic status within the region. The only purpose we need to pass this is because it is due, because it is the law, and it is how we ensure that we are able to receive our federal funding, which is approximately 25% of our total budget. So I just want to make sure I understand. What has been presented here does not tell the Board, no, we cannot provide transit service. It is simply a way to look at it and say, we may have an issue if it reaches a certain threshold that we need to be aware of in order to be able to approve changes in service, fare changes, or other changes that would create a potential burden on specific communities as defined within the Title VI language.

So in doing this work, given my background, and doing an assessment of whether if we-- and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is with doing this work or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyzes, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything. And that's a disservice when we think about our populations within our service area, specifically, as we look at our Census data, where 38.1% is BIPOC, 13.1%-- or 14.1%, rather for low income. Right? And then if we look the onboard survey, 56% are considered BIPOC.

The Board should never be asked to pass things because it's due in two days. And I know there's a lot of things that go into the delay. But that's just not the right-- that's not the right urgency to place on the Board to act. Secondly, I don't know very much about this topic, and I have sat in on two operations committee meetings. I've talked to a bunch of people. I've done my own research. And I still am looking for a succinct description of the program. I would note that there was a wonderful book written by Robert Caro. It's called The Power Broker. I'm sure a lot of people in this room know it. Talks a lot about bad policy decisions on disadvantaged communities and how those decisions were made and the harmful outcome of those decisions. It is 15 pages shorter than our packet tonight. He won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1,200 page treatise on impact by public infrastructure. I would request that when we're passing along documents as part of a packet, it needs to have a point, and it should be summarized from the committee for the rest of the Board. Simply passing things along for us does not help me understand this better. I'm probably a yes vote tonight, but I was a no vote until about an hour and a half ago. And so just, when you are putting together packets on complex questions for the Board, giving us reams of paper does not help us get to a better decision. So that's something, a request for the two, three-ish Committee Chairs as you're putting together topics like this, and that would be very helpful for me to make better decisions. Thanks.",

These are going to be the flagship of our flagship BRT line, and if these suck, it will kill BRT. And if they are not comfortable, if they are not just awesome in every way possible-- you can make a lot of choices when you buy a bus about how nice it's going to be in the same way can make a lot of choices about how when you buy a car, about how nice it's going to be. And so I just want to lean in here, and I do have one question to say that we need to pull the stops out. We need to make sure we're giving you enough money, GM/CEO Johnson, to make sure we're buying top of the line, to make sure that these are things that when they run through my district, people go, wow, I want to get on that. Not, wow, that doesn't look very nice. And so my question for you is, how do you know that the amount of money that we're authorizing today is enough to get top of the line?

Now, keeping in mind there's a couple of elements. These buses have to be dedicated because this is designated as a bus rapid transit project as defined by the Federal Transit Administration. There are certain criteria that we have to ensure that we adhere to. This will be a dedicated fleet just by virtue of the configuration of BRT, with it being a center running platform. So when you talk about it being top of the line, that's yet to be seen in reference to what we had before us, because there's only two original equipment manufacturers in the United States, there's only so many suppliers, there are certain seats, and there is a national task force on which I sit, where we're talking about doing away with customization, because that increases prices.

Tonight as a Board, we have an opportunity to do that in a particularly powerful way. Our rider surveys tell a clear story. Over half of our passengers live below 200% of the federal poverty level, and they are far less likely to own a car. Our riders with disabilities use RTD at disproportionately high rates, as do other vulnerable populations in our community. Yet only a fraction of affordable housing developed near our stations truly meets the needs of our most dedicated riders. Communities in our state have struggled to create housing targeted at our ridership. Inclusionary zoning has mostly led to housing at 60% AMI, about $51,000 a year in earnings. This housing is necessary, but priced well out of reach for someone making only $31,000, which is 200% of the federal poverty line. This amendment empowers RTD to deepen our land discount offerings up to 75% to incentivize projects specifically tailored to the actual economic realities of our riders. Here's how that can work in practice. Just this month, Denver Health donated the land to create Tapestry, a deeply affordable, accessible, transit- oriented housing project. It supports a range of affordability from 30% to 80% as well as far more three bedroom and even four bedroom units than most affordable projects being built today. It targets accessibility because distance to transit is a major barrier for people with disabilities to use transit. This holds for all types of disabilities, and unfortunately, painfully few class A fully accessible units exist in the RTD service area. By creating greater incentives for developers, we can do a lot to play our part in fixing that. It's late, so I won't go through the argument for reduced parking and service of CFHA's priority populations. You all have an email from me with that data. But I do want Director Harwick to speak after me to address the language, he added on smaller footprint and below market retail. Community is about more than housing, and I enthusiastically added his language for the reasons he'll highlight. This framework recognizes that we are not the housing policy experts. It increases the scope of our tools and trusts our staff to use them effectively to bring us thoughtful projects, projects that align with our strategic priority of community value and enable us to grow ridership by putting the people who most need transit where they can best be served by it. I ask your support for this amendment.",

And I'm wildly in favor of anything that we can do to bring more housing, let alone affordable housing, to our park and rides. I do think it's really key that we also think about what are the businesses that we are bringing in there. And having spent a lot of time working at Starbucks and a good friend of mine works at Starbucks, I'm also really in favor of coffee shops like Prodigy and smaller shops. But also thinking about when I've traveled to travel to other communities throughout the world, there oftentimes are smaller retail shops that give young entrepreneurs that opportunity to start a business and not be burdened by a larger footprint that some of our larger restaurants or larger retail shops can. They can cover those costs. So this, to me, was a way to encourage local businesses to start up or expand give them the opportunity in a place that we all-- when we go to a park and ride and there's not something there to grab that quick bite to eat, I want to give them that opportunity, everyone that opportunity. One to shop there and sell there.",

And the issue-- I have heartburn over just the main motion because the way it's written. We, as a Board, are not just expanding the bounds of what a policy is. We're also signing away 30 plus years of precedent of having this guardrail that says, before you go dispense a real property, get our preliminary authorization. So I am already a little bit uncomfortable. And also the policy says that if a developer, as it relates to housing, cannot meet our 50% standard, they could still get a major discount and it could be millions and millions of dollars. And so those two combined and just recognizing that these deals take a long, long time. They're not summer projects. In some, it means that all of that is going to happen. And then it's going to come back to the Board when all of those decisions have been made. So for that, because I'm struggling with the original proposal, but I can accept it for now, is why I can't vote yes on Secretary Nicholson's amendment, because we don't have guardrails that I would prefer.

Although I am with you in spirit-- deeply affordable housing is really important-- I'm not sure that giving an additional 25% discount in our policy is wise for a number of reasons. I do believe, however-- and maybe Madam CEO or Ms. Chessy Brady might be able to speak to this. I'm not sure. What we were asked for in this policy was to give guidelines to begin negotiation that would eventually come back to this Board. Let's say a developer comes to us and just brings us an amazing proposal that includes everything that you could want in a development and more. I don't see why they wouldn't necessarily come back to us and say, hey, they're willing to do all of these things-- they being staff-- and asking for an additional amount of up to whatever amount makes sense to give that discount from the Board that we would consider properly and then be able to authorize in that moment. But in order to begin the process, we were simply asked to give authorization for them to work within a parameter. That way, there was no confusion that they would be able to do a 30% to 50% discount as was written in the original policy. Beyond that, the Board would still have authority, as I understand it, if we were asked to offer an additional discount for more. I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former Directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of the agency. And so I would like to ask that question. Is there anything that would prevent you from coming back to us if we were to receive such an excellent proposal that prevents you from saying, can we receive an additional discount to offer a developer, Board, and would you approve this so we can make a project work?",

To some, that's a deep discount. To others, that's nothing. So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can define it elsewhere. But I do want to leave this language. And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that I want. And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75% But this is our property, and I really would like to see it sold for the highest value to benefit all. Thank you.",

But as someone who's an expert in the space, and I will say you and I worked pretty closely together on this language and went back and forth. You did a meeting with me. So this isn't just something that I wrote myself. This is something that got vetted pretty heavily by staff. What impact does a greater discount have on the types of projects that, in the affordable housing space, you tend to see people able to build? At least from where I sit, the reason for doing this is that when it comes to those deeply affordable, which are deeply subsidized units, when it comes to things like units that are fully accessible, those are expensive. They cost developers money, which is why, when you don't have those subsidies, those units don't get built. I think it's about half the projects that are in the CHFA Database have zero units at 30% AMI, and very few of them have anything with regard to accessibility. So I'm hoping you can maybe elaborate on-- you're the one who would be using this tool at the end of the day. How do you see it coming in handy with regard to what you're able to do? And then I have one last follow up.",

Denver Health, as you stated, as I assume it's correct, donated the land for Tapestry. I can assure you that development was still very difficult to finance. So even if we were giving the land at 100% discount, the projects would still not pencil, in many cases. And so our ability to discount the land to 75% as the Board prefers, in many cases, could get us over the hump from a project not being built to a project being built, and to that project having more affordable units as opposed to a higher, more of a middle income range. And that's the difference that the land discount makes. And that's the certainty that this policy helps me bring to conversations with developers. Gets them in the mindset of we're going to get some help here from RTD. We can focus on deeper affordability units. We can make bigger promises to CHFA or other financing entities that host in Denver. And it helps us keep the projects moving. And I'll be frank with you. As I said, Tapestry, even with 100% discount, it's still hard to do. This is not a silver bullet. But it moves the needle and it helps us actually keep projects afloat and get to the finish line.",

I think increasing ridership is something we all agree on. This is a concrete way to do that. It also takes land not just for our benefit in ridership, but also puts improvements on it that helps the tax base. And I think the communities that we serve would rather see a housing project end up on that property where it becomes improved versus somewhere else. We're not the only game in town. There's a lot of discounts out there. And so we're not necessarily in a tight buyer's market. There's a lot of projects that can go forward. And I think we need to put our best deal, and at least give Chessy and the rest of the team the tools to bring the deal forward. I do want to put one plug-in. We talked about it. I don't think ground leases are the best tool in Colorado. First of all, it's not as common as other places in the world. And the other thing is, toward the end of your ground lease, no matter how long you make it, the property will fall into disrepair. They are not going to put money into physical facilities that are going to roll off their books. So for that reason, the discount's great and I love a sale versus a ground lease. And I know you'll keep that in mind as we go forward. And anyway, that's another argument in favor of that tactic.",

Just recognizing that we didn't have full staff concurrence on the first sentence, which would have applied this accessibility minimum to market rate housing. And sometimes you shoot for the stars and land on the moon. The second sentence, which just applies to the HUD requirement to affordable housing, we did get staff concurrence. That was the context behind that. I sent out like a Q&A, frequently asked questions in anticipation of some questions. So I'm happy to entertain any or we can address them. I will say that we worked for three weeks and some change on this with housing advocates and folks who had worked in the space, and people had worked at CHFA and at the state level on similar policy and advocacy organizations and then staff and legal. So, I mean, just-- I'm sorry. I am tired. In case anybody has any questions about what this is, I think it just simplify it and say that HUD has a current minimum accessibility requirement for funding. And it's 5% of units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Additional 2% of units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities. And so a lot of times in these projects, that HUD requirement is going to kick in. But not all projects are going to have HUD dollars. So just recognizing that a lot of jurisdictions take that HUD standard, which is-- maybe Ms. Brady can correct me, but I think it's 20 plus years, 30 plus years old now. And they also incorporate that into their policies or their code or statute. We did the same. Good for goose, good for gander. I will stop there unless anyone else has further questions or comments.",

There is reference to this if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not necessarily required. We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to get licensed. And so, to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units, I would like to see this in the policy. I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this, to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement that's established. And although it is established in other places, it is not established in our policy.

But I think that this is like a safety net in my mind about how to really get there for this community.

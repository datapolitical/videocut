WEBVTT

00:00.335 --> 00:24.568
Staff are you guys ready to start the recording?

00:26.611 --> 00:27.372
We were right on it.

00:30.170 --> 00:33.996
I'll now call the Wednesday, May 28th RTD Board meeting to order.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.659
We're convened as of 7 p.m.

00:35.839 --> 00:41.808
I would respectfully ask everyone to remain muted unless you're recognized to speak.

00:41.848 --> 00:44.292
Thank you all for joining us this evening.

00:44.913 --> 00:57.493
As the board has moved to in-person meetings for monthly gatherings, please note that committee meetings of the RTD Board of Directors will still be held remotely via Zoom and will be audio and video recorded.

00:58.267 --> 01:05.842
The meeting recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as practical on the board's website.

01:06.343 --> 01:13.356
Visit RTD-Denver.com, and a live stream of this meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page.

01:14.011 --> 01:19.119
During tonight's meeting, we're also providing communication access real-time translation, also known as CART.

01:19.860 --> 01:28.695
Anyone who'd like to access this service should send an email to the RTD board office at rtd.boardoffice at rtd-denver.com.

01:29.276 --> 01:30.297
And a link will be provided.

01:31.259 --> 01:41.335
Additionally, the CART transcript can be automatically translated into Spanish for anyone who'd like access to a live transcript of this meeting in Spanish.

01:42.243 --> 01:46.592
I'll now ask Secretary Nicholson, could you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:51.963 --> 02:02.985
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,

02:08.872 --> 02:09.613
Thank you, Secretary.

02:10.735 --> 02:13.879
I will now read the land acknowledgement.

02:14.660 --> 02:26.978
The RTD Board of Directors acknowledges the land on which our buses and trains operate is their traditional territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, Arapah, and other contemporary tribal nations that are historically tied to these lands.

02:27.759 --> 02:35.149
We honor our indigenous elders who have traveled, inhabited, and steward these mountains, hills, and plains throughout generations.

02:35.635 --> 02:49.533
May this acknowledgement demonstrate a commitment to working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of inequity of the native and all historically oppressed peoples and recognize their current and future contributions in the district as we move forward.

02:50.694 --> 02:51.555
I'll now call the roll.

02:51.856 --> 02:52.456
Treasure banker.

02:53.278 --> 02:53.638

Dr. Larsen.

03:13.039 --> 03:13.260
Here.

03:14.061 --> 03:14.842

03:15.984 --> 03:16.264
I'm here.

03:26.739 --> 03:27.360
Dr. Ruscha.

03:31.373 --> 03:32.014
Okay.

03:32.174 --> 03:33.216
They're not on the zoom.

03:33.236 --> 03:33.376
Okay.

03:33.396 --> 03:34.498
Thank you.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.021
Uh, and second vice chair went more.

03:36.742 --> 03:37.082
I'm here.

03:38.304 --> 03:38.605
Awesome.

03:38.865 --> 03:42.531
We have 13 present to absent.

03:43.633 --> 03:43.934
Pardon me.

03:45.817 --> 03:47.459
Moving on to our retiree awards.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.924
There are no retiree awards for this evening.

03:50.324 --> 03:55.693
Second quarter retiree awards will be announced at the June 24th board of directors meeting.

03:56.956 --> 04:01.964
Next is our public participation period, which is open to anyone who would like to address the board.

04:02.886 --> 04:10.458
As we have both in-person and remote attendees, in-person comments will go first, followed by those who are participating remotely.

04:11.881 --> 04:15.807
For those attending in-person, please come up to the podium when your name is called.

04:16.569 --> 04:22.879
If you have not already signed up to speak and like to do so, please approach the podium when I call for any additional speakers.

04:23.618 --> 04:30.889
For those attending virtually, if you wish to speak and have not already done so, please raise your virtual hand or press star nine on your phone.

04:31.950 --> 04:34.674
Staff will unmute you when it is your turn to speak.

04:34.694 --> 04:38.540
If you dialed in, press star six to toggle your mute settings.

04:39.421 --> 04:43.146
Please bear in mind that by participating in this process, you are being recorded.

04:44.008 --> 04:47.753
If you do not wish to be recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted via writing.

04:48.425 --> 05:02.198
If any speaker has documentation or reference materials for the board, or if any member of the public would like to submit written comments, please email those materials to the board office at rtd.directors at rtd-denver.com.

05:02.887 --> 05:06.512
During this time, the board will not offer any direct comments or responses.

05:07.033 --> 05:16.286
However, if you'd like to be contacted regarding your public comment, please email the RTD board office at RTD.directors at RTD-Denver.com.

05:17.187 --> 05:22.815
Speakers should begin their remarks by stating their names, and will have up to three minutes to provide their comments.

05:24.357 --> 05:29.164
Our first speaker tonight will be Joan Beck, Longmont Mayor,

05:35.033 --> 05:45.650
Good evening, Chair Bouquet and Director Johnson and board, thank you so much for letting me address you tonight.

05:46.551 --> 05:54.223
I am here representing not only the city of Longmont, but the Front Range Passenger Rail District Board, which I am the secretary of.

05:54.203 --> 06:03.038
I want you to know right off the bat that the board has as many questions about this new draft of IGA that you do.

06:03.799 --> 06:15.620
So we are looking at it, scrutinizing it as well, but are very, very excited about the prospect of being able to work together and see this rail come to completion.

06:16.521 --> 06:19.907
I also want to thank

06:20.596 --> 06:26.320
this board for the partnership that we have with our ride, Longmont.

06:26.485 --> 06:35.573
We have exceeded 27,000 rides since December, which far outpaced the parent company of Via in Seattle.

06:36.254 --> 06:37.355
So we're really proud of that.

06:37.455 --> 06:41.298
And that is directly because of the partnership we are doing with you.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.860
So thank you very much.

06:44.661 --> 06:49.366
I am also going to ask for the Alex one to be restored.

06:49.386 --> 06:56.492
I get a little frustrated when you use ridership as a reason for not

06:56.472 --> 07:03.603
Restoring that because bus staying now, which is at the Firestone Hub is packed.

07:04.244 --> 07:21.231
Those buses are packed and that ridership should belong to RTD and it makes me sad that that bus was cut and our people now aren't interested that much in RTD because

07:21.616 --> 07:23.878
bus staying is taking care of it and getting our money.

07:25.840 --> 07:38.834
I also want to let you know that I'm switching hats here from the FRPR board as well as City of Longmont.

07:39.054 --> 07:46.001
I want to know you to know that I am very excited about this rail for many reasons.

07:46.542 --> 07:51.387
First of all, it's an economic driver, and it is a huge project that I think

07:52.177 --> 07:54.386
we should take pride in together.

07:54.406 --> 08:00.229
And to think about, I know the cost is huge on both sides.

08:01.289 --> 08:10.099
But when we first heard about the cost of the Northwest Corridor in about 2017, it was $1.2 or $1.4 billion.

08:10.119 --> 08:17.548
And now BNSF's value to you, to RTD is 650 million.

08:18.229 --> 08:19.811
So that is quite a difference.

08:19.831 --> 08:29.322
And part of that is due to the fact that the last three cities on the Northwest Corridor, Westminster,

08:29.622 --> 08:39.153
Broomfield and Lewisville are being taken off of your plate and FRPR is going to operate them.

08:41.456 --> 08:46.521
I don't know as none of us know how that funding is going to work out.

08:47.382 --> 08:58.515
But what I would like to offer and invite the RTD executive board, I think I believe that when we sit down face to face,

08:58.917 --> 09:08.369
and work out what it is we think can happen because our boards are the ones that are going to decide this one way or the other.

09:08.409 --> 09:09.711
We're the ones that are going to vote.

09:10.512 --> 09:25.110
So if you would think about the executive committee and the executive board or committee of FRPR and RTD sitting down together and just diving into this IGA,

09:25.630 --> 09:28.754
and trying to figure out what can we vote for?

09:29.615 --> 09:33.861
What will really work for both of us, both districts?

09:35.063 --> 09:45.117
For me, that would be better in being able to see people face to face, emotions talking, and just working through it.

09:45.918 --> 09:51.545
Because I never like going through third parties telling us what we should or shouldn't be doing.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.030
But I understand that the joint service

09:55.178 --> 09:56.962
is probably going to happen.

09:57.523 --> 09:59.006
How do we want it to happen?

09:59.748 --> 10:03.315
And it is our boards that will decide that in the end.

10:04.197 --> 10:06.382
So thank you very much.

10:06.783 --> 10:10.351
And let's just keep rolling along.

10:12.094 --> 10:12.916
Thank you, Mayor Peck.

10:13.838 --> 10:15.702
Next up, we have Dr. Kay Bowman.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.406
Well, good afternoon.

10:25.466 --> 10:30.214
My name is Reverend Dr. Kay Palmer-Marsh, and I'm from Longmont, Colorado.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.238
And I want to congratulate you.

10:32.258 --> 10:34.422
And thank you for having us all here.

10:34.482 --> 10:35.564
I really appreciate it.

10:35.604 --> 10:38.549
Thank you, board, for the public participation.

10:39.311 --> 10:42.497
I want to thank you for what you've done in the past.

10:43.017 --> 10:48.287
You've had courage, vision, and guts to start

10:48.267 --> 10:50.431
this fast-track program.

10:50.731 --> 10:56.561
I remember when I first moved to Denver 40 years ago, there was no such thing.

10:56.581 --> 10:59.426
I came from Chicago and there was no such thing.

11:00.348 --> 11:04.555
The board had this vision and you went forward with it.

11:04.535 --> 11:12.765
And now there's a little bit of a hesitation about coming it all the way up to Longmont.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.632
Well, I want you to know that Longmont is a wonderful place.

11:19.113 --> 11:26.062
We just don't trust you all that much anymore because we've been paying taxes since 2005.

11:27.204 --> 11:33.732
But we're looking forward to this board having the courage and the guts and the vision

11:34.943 --> 11:44.493
to make this happen for community and communities down the line that have been paying taxes since 2005 on this.

11:45.033 --> 11:48.197
We voted to support this and we still support it.

11:49.117 --> 11:51.440
It's just a little touchy right now.

11:52.361 --> 11:54.483
I do want to address equity.

11:55.444 --> 12:04.393
We look at equity in Longmont as how come Highlands Ranch

12:04.694 --> 12:07.478
has access to this wonderful rail.

12:07.839 --> 12:13.066
How come Boulder has so many buses?

12:13.086 --> 12:16.491
And in Longmont, we don't have so many buses.

12:16.551 --> 12:17.512
We keep getting cut.

12:17.913 --> 12:20.877
And of course, you know, we don't have our rail yet either.

12:21.578 --> 12:24.843
And so we look at equity in a different way than you do.

12:24.863 --> 12:27.647
I also know that you have

12:27.998 --> 12:44.862
looked at equity in terms of in a different way that doesn't really make sense to us when we look at Boulder, being very high income and having all their buses and good transportation.

12:45.483 --> 12:52.273
Highlands Ranch is another good example of a fairly high-end community that has access to passenger rail.

12:52.933 --> 12:55.457
We, in Longmont,

12:55.437 --> 13:00.448
look for a more, shall we say, a looser version of the equity argument.

13:01.290 --> 13:06.641
Right now it looks like the equity argument is being used so that we won't get it.

13:08.144 --> 13:10.349
On the other hand, I've heard some good things.

13:10.509 --> 13:14.037
I'm excited about what could happen.

13:14.017 --> 13:22.168
Again, Longland is still, we're developing trust, I hope, with the RTD.

13:22.228 --> 13:28.036
My neighbors don't particularly trust you when I was walking around with one petition or another.

13:28.136 --> 13:33.444
They didn't want to even let me in the door when I said RTD, so.

13:34.846 --> 13:40.834
Thank you for this opportunity, and I strongly support the Northwest Rail, and I hope you will too.

13:42.603 --> 13:46.152
Thank you, Reverend Dr. Madeline Marsh is our next speaker.

13:49.602 --> 13:53.051
Thank you, board members, for allowing us to speak tonight.

13:53.091 --> 13:54.074
My name is Madeline Marsh.

13:54.094 --> 13:56.460
I'm also from Longmont.

13:56.727 --> 14:00.893
I voted for fast tracks in my very first election.

14:00.933 --> 14:19.157
I was a brand new 18 year old in 2004 and here we are 21 years later and we still don't have there you have instead of a trained alongman or or more dedicated bus services even you have cut services to Longmont and so that it's it's

14:19.390 --> 14:30.320
It's frustrating to be here asking for more for what we voted for and what you're legally obligated to provide based on the results of that election.

14:31.221 --> 14:37.526
In the 21 years since I voted for that, I ended up living in Chicago for a few years.

14:37.546 --> 14:41.150
I enjoyed a robust public transit system.

14:41.910 --> 14:44.332
I took the bus.

14:44.413 --> 14:45.413
I took trains to work.

14:45.473 --> 14:46.875
I took trains to play.

14:46.935 --> 14:49.397
I took trains to the suburbs, to the city.

14:49.377 --> 14:52.542
And it was an economic driver for every community that was involved.

14:52.963 --> 14:55.868
There's the bustling downtowns wherever you go.

14:56.349 --> 15:06.506
And like others have said, the people in Longmont are not inclined to trust RTD because the trust has been broken.

15:07.628 --> 15:10.272
We keep getting pushed off and pushed off and pushed off.

15:10.252 --> 15:32.491
And so I would ask that you vote in favor of the Northwest Rail expansion, but also that you don't limit it to three trips every weekday, but that you have the vision to allow us to bring our money to Denver to other communities for entertainment purposes and as well as work purposes.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.594
And thank you very much for your time.

15:36.274 --> 15:36.915
Thank you, Madeline.

15:37.555 --> 15:39.617
I have Connor Sheo as our next speaker.

15:52.692 --> 15:53.433
Good evening, board.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.159
My name is Connor Shea, and I live in the Baker neighborhood of Denver.

15:57.720 --> 16:02.147
I'm here representing the Baker Historic Neighborhood Association as a member of its board.

16:02.688 --> 16:07.556
I live a few blocks from the Alameda station, and I use RTD's bus and rail services pretty frequently.

16:08.557 --> 16:17.772
As you're probably aware, Denver is in the process of considering a women's soccer league stadium at the former Gates River Factory site just west of the I-25 and Broadway station.

16:18.528 --> 16:34.022
As the stadium will be across from the freight rail tracks, across the freight rail tracks from the RTD station, transit riders need to cross over the tracks to reach the stadium from the various RTD bus and rail stations, bus and rail connections at the station.

16:35.224 --> 16:41.730
Currently, the only pedestrian access route from the Broadway station is the Southern Bridge, sometimes referred to as the Bridge to Nowhere.

16:41.770 --> 16:47.455
That path will be about three quarters of a mile going from the station to the stadium.

16:48.464 --> 16:53.471
and then some, the same distance going back after a soccer game or other event at the venue.

16:54.652 --> 17:00.360
As a neighborhood, we intend to push for a North Bridge to the site, connecting the station and stadium as directly as possible.

17:00.740 --> 17:07.749
And I'm here to ask for RTD's cooperation on this since a bridge would require the use of RTD land on the Broadway station.

17:09.552 --> 17:12.936
A North Bridge has been in most past plans for the development of the site.

17:13.220 --> 17:19.831
but is considered optional as part of the non-binding agreement between the city and the stadium owners that city council passed a few weeks ago.

17:21.093 --> 17:28.785
The North Bridge connection would mean only one quarter mile of walking to go from the RTD station to the stadium.

17:29.947 --> 17:39.362
In total, the bridge, a North Bridge would save a full mile of walking about 20 minutes when going to the stadium and then back after an event ends.

17:39.713 --> 17:44.782
We believe the shorter distance with the North pedestrian bridge would encourage significantly more transit usage.

17:46.124 --> 17:54.017
When going to events at the stadium, the Broadway station is accessible from the DE and H lines without a transfer and all other lines with only one transfer.

17:54.819 --> 18:02.532
It's also accessible from a variety of bus routes that would reduce traffic and emissions coming through our neighborhood and the other neighborhoods adjacent to the stadium.

18:04.233 --> 18:18.946
A north bridge would be good for our neighborhood, for the safety of pedestrians and transit users, as they won't have to cross as many streets when accessing the stadium, and would be good for RTD and extra fares and customers from events at the stadium.

18:19.687 --> 18:26.813
The extra bridge would provide better connections and redundancy for pedestrians, but would especially improve accessibility for folks with limited mobility.

18:28.455 --> 18:33.379
I'm here to ask for RTD's cooperation and support on getting this included in the stadium project.

18:33.730 --> 18:38.177
as we work on negotiating community benefits agreement with the developer over the next few months.

18:39.378 --> 18:49.614
I sent an email to the board and CEO Johnson about this on Friday and would be happy to receive any emails from the board or CEO if anyone has any further questions about that.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.196
Thank you very much for your time.

18:52.258 --> 18:53.179
Thank you for your comments, sir.

18:54.681 --> 18:57.466
I will now move to online participants.

18:57.546 --> 19:00.430
Mr. Kroll, has anyone have their virtual hand raised?

19:01.203 --> 19:04.227
Yes, at this time we have a number of folks with their hands raised.

19:04.647 --> 19:07.871
The first is former RTD director Claudia Fulska.

19:10.594 --> 19:10.734
Ms.

19:10.754 --> 19:11.115
Fulska.

19:21.627 --> 19:22.068
So Ms.

19:22.128 --> 19:25.692
Fulska, it looks like you briefly came off mute and then went right back on.

19:26.228 --> 19:27.638
Okay, now you are unmuted.

19:27.961 --> 19:28.706
Woo!

19:29.371 --> 19:31.547
This is a huge achievement, guys.

19:32.742 --> 19:33.923
Oh, God.

19:34.564 --> 19:45.856
I was so thrilled to hear the earlier special session and kudos to all of you, especially General Manager, CEO Deborah Johnson.

19:46.196 --> 19:48.398
What a great accomplishment.

19:48.538 --> 19:50.981
Lisa Kaufman, Diane.

19:51.782 --> 19:57.788
And now I'm forgetting her last name, but I mean, everybody was really amazing.

19:57.768 --> 20:15.345
I would ask the chair to afford me a little bit more time as it's customary for former directors to be granted additional time as they have institutional knowledge to share and inform the board.

20:15.746 --> 20:17.507
Would that be okay with you, Mr. Chair?

20:18.188 --> 20:18.688
Of course.

20:19.529 --> 20:20.290
Thank you very much.

20:20.310 --> 20:23.353
I appreciate that.

20:23.992 --> 20:42.415
So I was reflecting on my early days on the board, and we were desperately trying to find the money to do the R line, which goes through district B and F, I think.

20:42.435 --> 20:43.857
I don't remember, but.

20:43.837 --> 20:51.493
Anyway, and Phil Washington was our executive director then, and he had this brilliant motto.

20:51.954 --> 20:58.989
He always said every day, practically, we will build as much as we can, as fast as we can, no matter what.

20:59.650 --> 21:05.001
But when it came time to find the money for the R line,

21:04.981 --> 21:07.964
He would pick up any nickel under any rock.

21:08.064 --> 21:09.145
And you can ask him that.

21:09.946 --> 21:11.287
And those are his words.

21:11.307 --> 21:21.756
And he opened up a meeting, a luncheon for all business leaders, small and large, to figure out, this is what we have to work with.

21:21.977 --> 21:22.877
How can we do it?

21:23.578 --> 21:27.842
And it took a series of IGAs to get this thing done.

21:28.342 --> 21:28.923
Lots of them.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.004
So we're on the way.

21:30.424 --> 21:31.345
We're moving along.

21:31.385 --> 21:32.286
Everything is great.

21:33.047 --> 21:34.448
And then,

21:34.546 --> 21:54.023
Bruce Benson, who is the president of the University of Colorado, comes over to the board and says, hey, hey, no, no, no, we need you to change the alignment of the R line and take it off of Montview Boulevard right through Anschutz Medical Center campus.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.131
Now, you can imagine.

21:56.171 --> 21:57.694
We're like, what?

21:57.714 --> 22:03.403
I mean, this was a huge shock blow to all of us.

22:03.623 --> 22:04.946
And what were we going to do?

22:04.966 --> 22:06.768
Well, you know what that means?

22:07.209 --> 22:11.496
It requires 10 votes, a super majority.

22:11.536 --> 22:12.738
And guess what?

22:13.299 --> 22:17.246
Those folks in Longmont, in the North, they weren't having it.

22:17.947 --> 22:20.010
They were not going to do it.

22:19.990 --> 22:34.086
But it required all of us, each and every one of us, to have those one-on-one discussions and promise, promise the people in the North, let's just get this one thing done, and then we can move on to the North.

22:34.927 --> 22:36.649
Now it's their turn.

22:37.210 --> 22:41.695
Now it's time to finish the Northwest Rail.

22:41.675 --> 22:45.601
And those numbers, the finances and all of that, they'll come out.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.343
You guys will figure it out.

22:47.904 --> 22:49.326
Everybody is coming together.

22:49.346 --> 22:59.701
All those different entities and an IGA is so critical to proceed and move forward and do what the voters elected to have done.

23:00.182 --> 23:02.245
Fast tracks, they elected you to finish it.

23:02.726 --> 23:05.470
You may not even like it, but it's not you.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.793
It's the people that voted for it.

23:07.973 --> 23:10.517
It's the RTD's obligation

23:11.645 --> 23:23.308
And by the way, of the 3.1 million people living in the district, 97% of them don't even use RTD, and they're paying for that train.

23:23.845 --> 23:33.155
And now you have this wonderful, exciting, incredible opportunity to finish it and even connect beyond the district into Fort Collins.

23:33.215 --> 23:38.120
What a boon for everybody and for the entire state, quite frankly.

23:38.681 --> 23:44.607
So I'm like, you can probably tell I'm so excited and proud of you guys.

23:44.868 --> 23:47.170
It's like, woo, about time.

23:48.263 --> 23:55.093
Now, the other topic that's on my mind is access on demand.

23:56.235 --> 24:00.501
Your annual operating budget is $1.32 billion.

24:01.242 --> 24:14.541
And if you're thinking about equity and 20% of the population, roughly, a little more, a little less, are people with disabilities, then 20% of that operating budget is closer to two

24:14.521 --> 24:16.685
$164 million.

24:16.845 --> 24:21.194
And access on demand isn't anywhere close to that.

24:22.056 --> 24:27.125
I don't think either one of these recommendations to the board makes sense at all.

24:27.746 --> 24:30.792
And I would encourage you to look at it again.

24:30.913 --> 24:33.758
I mean, the numbers keep changing, by the way, for the subsidies.

24:33.778 --> 24:36.343
$16.

24:36.323 --> 24:38.970
to now 22 for access on demand.

24:39.050 --> 24:42.057
Now it's 100 for access a ride.

24:42.639 --> 24:53.826
And why not think like, you know, Einstein said you can get from point A to B with logic, but you can get everywhere with your imagination.

24:54.110 --> 25:01.461
What if you applied the access on demand model to access a ride using those vehicles?

25:01.962 --> 25:05.307
You could start with a little pilot and see how it worked.

25:05.908 --> 25:08.091
You could even use it to pick up other people.

25:08.492 --> 25:14.040
There's no prohibition from other people using those paratransit vehicles.

25:14.581 --> 25:18.767
And most of the time, they're sitting in a parking lot with a driver sleeping.

25:19.675 --> 25:23.459
So, of course, I haven't seen that, but, you know, I've been told.

25:23.479 --> 25:27.823
Former Director Fulska, if you could wrap up your comments, you're about double the time right now.

25:28.344 --> 25:29.465
Okay, I appreciate it.

25:29.545 --> 25:29.905
Thank you.

25:29.925 --> 25:31.567
I think that's it.

25:31.647 --> 25:45.642
So, I would encourage you sign the IGA, go forward with that, vote yes on it, and ask staff to go back and start using their imagination for better access on demand for everybody.

25:45.722 --> 25:47.083
Thank you very much for your time.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.665
Thank you, former director Fulska.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.430
Mr. Kroll, our next participant.

25:51.892 --> 25:55.142
Yes, next we have former director Doug Tisdale.

25:55.584 --> 25:58.272
Former director Tisdale, you're recognized.

26:00.901 --> 26:01.942
Thank you very much.

26:02.102 --> 26:06.586
I appreciate the opportunity to visit with you this evening.

26:06.606 --> 26:13.913
I am Doug Tisdale, former director for District H, and I apologize.

26:13.933 --> 26:21.760
You're only seeing a picture of me instead of my face in person, but I guess that's the restriction in any event.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.523
I'll try to keep this within the time constraints.

26:26.284 --> 26:30.148
The comment was made during public participation earlier.

26:30.584 --> 26:34.649
Highlands Ranch has access to rail.

26:35.991 --> 26:48.869
At the risk of being struck by lightning for contesting the testimony of a reverend, Highlands Ranch does not have access to rail.

26:49.770 --> 26:59.443
The Southwest Rail Extension, what I affectionately refer to as the SWARI, is one of the unfinished corridors of fast tracks.

26:59.795 --> 27:10.292
My successor as district H director made a reference to that in the special meeting earlier today many hours ago.

27:10.933 --> 27:24.815
The legislature at the urging of the governor only prioritized service for the northwest rail with no reference to the southwest rail extension, the SWARI.

27:25.476 --> 27:26.798
I must confess

27:27.436 --> 27:33.403
that I must have been an inadequate voice on behalf of the Swarie.

27:34.223 --> 27:45.916
I apologize to my former constituents and can only hope that my successor as vice chair of this board will be more impactful.

27:46.697 --> 27:54.726
That said, kudos to all of you for proceeding with the steps toward Northwest Rail Completion.

27:55.427 --> 27:56.768
I can only hope

27:57.018 --> 28:06.170
that we find the political will, the political courage to address the Swarie with the same kind of passion.

28:06.991 --> 28:09.093
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

28:09.434 --> 28:11.276
Thank you, former director Tisdale.

28:11.657 --> 28:12.758
Mr. Crowler, next speaker.

28:16.883 --> 28:21.529
Yes, next we have Matri Lazaroff.

28:21.589 --> 28:22.030
Hello.

28:22.482 --> 28:28.229
I'm Mitre Lazaroff and I am not here to talk about Northwest Rail.

28:29.210 --> 28:33.395
I am an RTD writer and I was formerly a regular writer of the event.

28:33.775 --> 28:44.148
And the reason I say former is, like many other writers, I was pushed off that I railed a year ago due to the fact that I could no longer rely on it as reliable transportation.

28:44.448 --> 28:49.654
And now the issue that caused me to be pushed off of the train is solved.

28:49.634 --> 28:52.419
And I know there's already been a little bit of outreach on this.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.403
There's an article on your website.

28:54.924 --> 29:01.016
But it is my opinion that RTD needs to be as loud as possible with this.

29:01.858 --> 29:04.723
You know, it's a sad fact that

29:04.703 --> 29:09.129
the majority of people in the metro don't ride transit.

29:09.149 --> 29:16.759
And we need to yell to get news like this out because it's hard for it to spread by, you know, with light announcements in word of mouth.

29:17.140 --> 29:26.613
We have lost as of 2024, 21.6% of E-line riders and 31.4% of H-line riders.

29:27.254 --> 29:28.315
And not only

29:28.295 --> 29:37.957
is that a massive hitch to the light rail system, but it leads to the rest of the system by people not being able to make those transfers.

29:37.977 --> 29:42.186
We saw ridership decreases on all three of our rail lines last year.

29:43.178 --> 29:48.104
And it's just, you know, directors making Reddit posts just really isn't enough.

29:48.764 --> 30:07.105
Um, would it be like, could we maybe, um, give two weeks of free fairs to try and like really get eyes back on the system to try and, um, like really make an effort to undo this ridership destruction that we've seen on, uh, our light rail, and especially on the Southeast quarter.

30:07.846 --> 30:08.367
Uh, thank you.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.328
That's my time.

30:10.349 --> 30:11.030
Thank you, matri.

30:11.530 --> 30:12.932
Mr. Krull, our next speaker.

30:13.672 --> 30:15.916
Yes, next we have Richard Bamber.

30:17.239 --> 30:18.100
Richard, you're recognized.

30:20.665 --> 30:25.013
Good evening and thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.

30:25.033 --> 30:28.980
I'd like to talk about the title six.

30:29.112 --> 30:31.136
changes which are up for approval tonight.

30:32.138 --> 30:44.505
GDT is generally in support of these changes, although a yes vote needs to be carried out against a backdrop that a review of the methodology is needed in the sort of medium term.

30:44.485 --> 30:52.926
Currently are these only reliable data source uses census data about what sort of populations demographics live in certain neighborhoods.

30:53.648 --> 30:59.963
So we make lots of effort to ensure service outside the front doors of equity populations.

31:00.517 --> 31:07.707
is sufficiently good that they're not left behind when service is improved and they're not unfairly targeted when service has to be cut.

31:08.648 --> 31:14.336
However, this approach only assumes equity populations only travel locally within the communities they reside.

31:15.158 --> 31:20.625
A good transit network can level up communities and spread wealth across its entire metro area.

31:21.026 --> 31:26.153
There's no point in running 15-minute frequency buses past the doorsteps of a

31:26.133 --> 31:36.447
low income or buy-pop community if they then have to transfer onto another bus which runs every 60 minutes and drops you a mile away from that well-paying employer.

31:37.372 --> 31:46.602
The current Title VI process fails to consider how a local transit network either succeeds or fails to service equity populations effectively.

31:46.923 --> 31:51.368
And it is because it considers the routes basically in silos.

31:51.788 --> 32:06.585
And this is why while we support the Title VI, we support the agency's efforts, we believe that it could be made a much more effective process if new data sources are considered and the methodology is reviewed.

32:06.565 --> 32:08.268
Thank you very much for letting me speak tonight.

32:09.350 --> 32:10.853
Thank you for your comments, Richard.

32:10.873 --> 32:12.196
Our next speaker, Mr. Krull.

32:12.216 --> 32:14.560
Yes, next is Joe Elizabeth Pinto.

32:15.823 --> 32:22.556
Joe, you are recognized.

32:22.796 --> 32:23.798
Am I unmuted?

32:24.419 --> 32:25.481
We hear you, Joe.

32:25.501 --> 32:25.921
Thank you.

32:26.642 --> 32:31.169
I would like to talk about quickly about two issues.

32:31.349 --> 32:35.215
The first is the Rockies ride.

32:35.275 --> 32:43.187
My family went to the Rockies game last week and we

32:43.167 --> 32:52.200
Looked up how to get there on the RTD website and there's a whole page dedicated to the Rockies ride.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.445
But when we got to the stop.

32:57.528 --> 33:02.435
There were no buses, no people, no cars, no nothing.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.618
So we called the RTD.

33:06.185 --> 33:14.811
2996,000 and the woman laughed and said, oh, we haven't had those buses for years.

33:15.854 --> 33:29.878
So the RTD needs to take down the Rocky's Ride info from its website if it is no longer running those services.

33:29.918 --> 33:41.878
And it needs to keep its website updated about the services that are provided because people depend on that website to be accurate.

33:43.630 --> 33:51.267
The other thing that I need to talk about is access on demand.

33:51.328 --> 33:55.918
And my issue is that when

33:57.620 --> 34:16.118
You look at the access on demand, and when you are talking about cutting services, which again, if we are 20 to 25% of the population that have disabilities, a little more, a little less, like Ms.

34:16.158 --> 34:24.606
Falska said, the idea to cut services

34:25.582 --> 34:53.243
based on the RTD schedule will leave people with no services on the weekends if the bus doesn't run on weekends to that part of the service area or at night or if they live more than three quarters of a mile from a bus stop and that will leave people stranded

34:54.826 --> 35:01.175
And people with disabilities go places after five o'clock.

35:01.735 --> 35:03.718
They go places on the weekends.

35:04.099 --> 35:11.609
They don't just go to doctors that are open in the daytime.

35:11.649 --> 35:12.770
They go to shows.

35:13.071 --> 35:14.372
They go to restaurants.

35:14.653 --> 35:18.638
They go to malls on the weekends.

35:18.778 --> 35:22.183
They go all the same places you do.

35:22.163 --> 35:31.515
It becomes really difficult when they are get stranded in their homes except from nine to five weekdays.

35:32.316 --> 35:47.074
So just take that into consideration when you make these cuts and imagine people who are disabled going to the same places you do and imagine being stranded at home.

35:48.455 --> 35:54.284
because you cut so that they can only go from nine to five on weekdays.

35:55.746 --> 36:00.473
Also, Joe, if you could wrap up your comments, you're about 30 seconds over.

36:00.493 --> 36:00.874
Thank you.

36:01.334 --> 36:10.548
The other thing is remember that these people with disabilities pay taxes to RTD the same way you do.

36:10.568 --> 36:11.550
Thank you.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.032
That's all I have to say.

36:13.092 --> 36:14.414
Thank you for your comments, Joe.

36:15.055 --> 36:16.217
Our next speaker, Mr. Krul.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.993
Yes, next we have Tim Keenan.

36:19.841 --> 36:20.689
Tim you're recognized?

36:34.135 --> 36:35.357
Tim, it looks.

36:35.377 --> 36:35.597
All right.

36:35.757 --> 36:36.378
Can you hear me now?

36:36.819 --> 36:37.600
We're going to hear you now.

36:37.620 --> 36:37.980
Thank you.

36:38.601 --> 36:39.042
All righty.

36:39.843 --> 36:41.105
I'm Tim Keenan.

36:41.145 --> 36:41.966
Thanks for listening.

36:42.767 --> 36:47.213
I am a totally blind user of Accessoride.

36:47.253 --> 36:48.254
I'm sorry.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.216
I have access on them.

36:49.636 --> 36:51.078
I'm not sure if you caught the beginning of that.

36:51.138 --> 36:51.719
I'm Tim Keenan.

36:51.739 --> 36:53.882
I'm a totally blind user of access on demand.

36:54.843 --> 37:01.172
And I live in Baker and work a fluctuating schedule out at Amazon and Aurora.

37:01.287 --> 37:04.832
which includes night and overnight shifts.

37:04.852 --> 37:16.950
So if you were to follow any of these recommendations, me and people like me, because I know there are a lot of people with disabilities who work out there, would not be able to use access on demand for at least one regular trip.

37:18.112 --> 37:22.318
In my case, that would eat in my paycheck by close to a third.

37:23.099 --> 37:28.527
So, and when you look at the numbers here, you know,

37:28.507 --> 37:40.283
Access on demand is probably the most efficient of your services with fixed routes costing $19 per boarding access on demand at 16 and access ride at 60.

37:41.345 --> 37:46.532
So this is this is really working well and to cut it.

37:46.512 --> 37:52.159
I think you need to decide whether this is, in fact, sustainable.

37:52.199 --> 37:56.445
I know there was a, the use was just blowing up and people got worried.

37:56.966 --> 37:59.148
And so they commissioned this review and all that.

37:59.689 --> 38:08.080
But really it's helping a lot of people and it's at 1.13% of your annual budget.

38:08.921 --> 38:10.783
It sounds pretty sustainable to me.

38:10.844 --> 38:14.308
Now, all that said, I don't know anyone who's not

38:14.727 --> 38:39.958
who wouldn't you know who I don't know anybody who'd be against paying a fare so if you add a four dollar and fifty cent fare and you know you're gonna that's two point eight million dollars of savings um from what you're from the current numbers and that's you know and that saved very uh

38:40.107 --> 38:43.492
You know, that that's doing something to put money back into the system.

38:44.214 --> 38:46.798
And we certainly don't mind paying our way.

38:48.200 --> 39:01.000
But to cut the area in hours is going to leave some people who don't even have bus service in their area anymore, but used to leave those people totally stranded without any kind of affordable transit option.

39:02.583 --> 39:05.187
So my ask would be.

39:06.466 --> 39:09.612
that you keep the limit at 60 trips a month.

39:09.652 --> 39:18.470
This allows full-time workers 40 trips and then 20 trips to do whatever they want your need to do, get groceries and participate in the community.

39:20.895 --> 39:26.145
Maintain the current service area and hours so you're not creating transit deserts.

39:27.003 --> 39:44.068
and implement pricing that's fair that stays constant at $4.50 or $2.25 for RTD Live that doesn't punish people for taking more trips like the tiered system would do, and it also doesn't have the added overhead that that system would have.

39:44.810 --> 39:56.487
So basically, you can keep the program as it is now at a fair and keep this program doing what it does best, which is connect

39:58.475 --> 40:00.158
people with disabilities with their community.

40:00.178 --> 40:01.280
You could wrap up your comments.

40:02.121 --> 40:02.542
All set.

40:02.582 --> 40:03.183
Thank you very much.

40:03.944 --> 40:04.905
Thank you for your comments, Tim.

40:05.326 --> 40:08.511
For the sake of the record, I'd like to note that Director Ruscha has joined us.

40:09.793 --> 40:10.975
Our next speaker, Mr. Kroll.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.019
Yes, next we have Nate Trela.

40:13.860 --> 40:14.721
Nate, you're recognized.

40:19.830 --> 40:20.952
Hi, this is Nate Trela.

40:20.992 --> 40:23.335
Thank you once again for the chance to speak.

40:24.698 --> 40:25.579
Hopefully we're

40:26.015 --> 40:43.669
Down the home stretch here in terms of finding a sustainable path forward for access on demand that still maintains this robust level of service and utility for for your, your district residents that cannot, you know, use a fixed route service independently.

40:44.662 --> 40:56.719
I implore you to kind of recognize a few facts that are in the staff's presentation that you're gonna be at the public school tonight and that was in the agenda packet for this meeting and for the operations meeting a couple weeks ago.

40:57.440 --> 41:07.915
And there's so many answered questions that you may already have as board members, information that you should definitely, in my opinion, make sure you know as you're making decisions about the future of this program.

41:08.736 --> 41:11.800
In the,

41:12.488 --> 41:22.104
The Agenda Packetary talks about how the cost of an access trip is just a fraction of the cost of a traditional access ride service.

41:22.986 --> 41:32.522
And I don't know if there has been any effort made to see if it's possible to try to encourage people to use access on demand instead of access ride.

41:33.804 --> 41:38.091
If people are fully aware of the capabilities of it, if people are aware of how to use it,

41:38.392 --> 41:46.427
Um, you know, converting a few of those access the ride trips to access on demand could give significant savings in this whole process.

41:47.437 --> 41:55.850
Also, it's worth pointing out that you are more than doubling the number of trips provided to people who cannot use fixed route service with access on demand as opposed to access to right.

41:56.150 --> 41:56.931
That's a success.

41:57.532 --> 42:04.002
You're helping people make connections, get around, participate in the workforce, participate in society.

42:04.703 --> 42:13.917
As we've heard people talk about shop, you know, go out and get some entertainment, whether it's movies or music or what have you, things have become possible with this program.

42:14.588 --> 42:20.680
Some of the answer questions in this program in these proposals is in a tiered fair concept.

42:20.980 --> 42:24.286
It talks about needing to hire additional staff.

42:24.467 --> 42:28.474
Perhaps it's already going to be discussed later tonight, but it's not clear what that staff would do.

42:29.216 --> 42:35.247
And it's hard to fathom what would need to be added.

42:37.808 --> 42:47.203
You'd handle by edit staff that couldn't be automated, couldn't be handled with the spreadsheet wizard in the knowledge of how to write some stuff in SQL.

42:48.325 --> 42:58.081
There are ways to gather a lot of different data in process, a lot of numbers analyzed to make this tiered fair approach work.

42:58.101 --> 43:02.027
So to get to know what those new hires would need to do.

43:02.429 --> 43:09.456
Both proposals call for cutting back, as we've talked about, the service area hours back to match access ride.

43:11.337 --> 43:18.003
This isn't required as a supplemental premium service access on demand doesn't have to line up with access ride.

43:18.023 --> 43:19.104
That is a choice it's made.

43:21.106 --> 43:26.872
Which question is, how would access ride in forcibly restricted hours contain both as plans?

43:26.952 --> 43:30.495
Because within the National Federation of the line of Colorado, I've spoken with

43:31.049 --> 43:35.755
RTD staff before we've been told that yes, it's very, you know, geo fencing to define the boundaries.

43:35.975 --> 43:37.558
If you wrap up your comments.

43:37.978 --> 43:38.959
Sure.

43:39.040 --> 43:44.407
Just saying that the cutback of the hours and it's going to be incredibly complex to manage.

43:45.228 --> 43:51.776
And it's unclear how you could expect somebody to do that, especially when again, the point of RTD is to help people make connections.

43:52.137 --> 43:55.181
Adding these layers of complexity to it does the exact opposite.

43:56.763 --> 43:57.284
Thank you, Nate.

43:58.105 --> 43:59.166
Our next speaker, Mr. Krull.

43:59.298 --> 44:01.221
Yes, next we have Cody Bear.

44:02.103 --> 44:02.984
Cody, you recognized?

44:06.470 --> 44:08.313
Good evening and thank you, RTD Board.

44:08.353 --> 44:20.192
I am also here to talk about access on demand service and have spoken about the topic at a few meetings before.

44:20.577 --> 44:39.345
Tonight, I want to say that I agree with, you know, what Dr. Falska and Tim Keenan said about, you know, this access on demand cost is really a fraction of RTD's budget, you know, just 1.13% and

44:39.629 --> 44:42.574
just north of, I think, $10 million.

44:43.215 --> 45:02.008
This is not a huge opportunity for RTD to save significantly on the budget and would be a huge loss of service for many Coloradoans in the RTD district with disabilities.

45:02.326 --> 45:21.195
Speaking to the current proposals that are out there, with the tiered proposal, one thing that I would urge the RTD board to think about and questions to ask would be, how would we actually enforce the fares of the tiered proposal?

45:21.255 --> 45:23.659
This service is offered amongst

45:23.858 --> 45:33.609
Uber, Lyft, and a couple of other taxi platforms, neither of which share information or communicate with each other at all.

45:33.769 --> 45:50.068
To that point, even in the current system as a user, if I want to, you know, see how many trips I've used, I have to open each platform and count the number that had been taken in the month on that platform.

45:50.403 --> 46:06.508
I just don't see an administratively effective way to make the fair thing work without putting that burden on the rider, which would inherently cause issues for people keeping track of it.

46:07.489 --> 46:18.807
Second, to follow up on Nate's comments about the hours, you look at somebody who's a full-time employee at Amazon,

46:19.192 --> 46:31.616
Tim, and many others who would be affected by this, that's taking, by cutting people's ability to use the service, we're taking tax revenue out of the Colorado economy.

46:31.636 --> 46:41.335
I'm not sure that that's something that makes a lot of sense for RTD, and people have built their lives around being able to access this service.

46:41.669 --> 46:55.884
And it's current state and, you know, any reduction and change of the service area or hours is a reduction in service in my mind and something that I would completely be against.

46:56.164 --> 47:00.349
Appreciate your guys' time tonight and that concludes my comments.

47:01.410 --> 47:02.511
Thank you for your comments, Cody.

47:02.871 --> 47:03.893
Mr. Crowler, next speaker.

47:04.273 --> 47:04.513
Yes.

47:04.713 --> 47:07.797
The last speaker we have in the queue is Marianne Millearelli.

47:08.798 --> 47:10.039
Marianne, you're at recognized.

47:12.955 --> 47:14.437
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

47:14.678 --> 47:17.161
Thank you so much for your time and your attention.

47:17.983 --> 47:31.262
Tonight, I would like to speak to you briefly about equity in the access on demand system and in RTD in general.

47:32.364 --> 47:40.937
We have been told by RTD members that we cannot have the multiple stop

47:41.373 --> 47:44.937
situation because that would not be equitable.

47:45.558 --> 47:50.264
We have been told that we can have certain things, but we can't have others.

47:51.345 --> 48:00.055
One of the things that we are now being told is that with this tiered system, we can have inequity in pricing.

48:00.656 --> 48:08.005
There is no place in the RTD system where riding more costs more per trip.

48:08.474 --> 48:10.958
that this does not happen on accessoride.

48:11.318 --> 48:19.710
It does not happen anywhere in the fixed route system on any light rail, on any bus.

48:19.730 --> 48:28.944
As a matter of fact, RTD went out of its way to remove the barriers to regional transit by removing the price barrier.

48:29.384 --> 48:34.752
But with the ideas of this tiered system, we are saying

48:35.018 --> 48:44.189
And you would be saying, if you approve it, that anybody who does more than 30 trips per month should have to pay more in order to use a system.

48:44.890 --> 48:47.474
That, ladies and gentlemen, is inequity.

48:48.074 --> 48:53.701
And that is not something that RTD should even have been entertaining that proposal.

48:54.462 --> 48:57.606
But you will do what is necessary.

48:57.666 --> 49:02.292
And I will thank you for the hard work that is involved in keeping our program alive.

49:03.875 --> 49:14.271
The other thought is in removing and putting the boundaries in for that are the same for accessoride.

49:15.092 --> 49:29.494
There are many people who will be affected whose life plans, the places they live, the places they work, the places they choose to do business and entertain will all be affected.

49:30.993 --> 49:39.860
People have been provided a service, have been able to make these decisions about their lives because of the service that is provided.

49:40.621 --> 49:47.587
And taking service away creates further inequity and transit deficits.

49:48.348 --> 49:51.190
That is not something RTD should be looking for doing.

49:52.011 --> 50:00.578
And I sincerely hope that in every way that you can, you find a way to keep the access on demand program

50:01.368 --> 50:03.210
as open as it is right now.

50:03.691 --> 50:19.892
I personally do not know anybody who would object to paying the 450 or 225 fare as proposed, but adding additional fares and cutting service will make transit deficits that should not be considered.

50:20.213 --> 50:25.620
Right now this program is moving people who have never had a chance to participate in

50:26.427 --> 50:30.310
public transit life in the way that we can right now.

50:30.871 --> 50:33.493
Please consider this when you're making your decisions.

50:33.914 --> 50:35.295
Thank you so much for your time.

50:35.335 --> 50:40.860
And those who remember me before, if I was there, I would bring you warm chocolate cookies.

50:42.541 --> 50:44.503
Thank you for your comments, Mary Ann.

50:45.384 --> 50:51.509
Are there any members of the public who'd like to, excuse me, Mr. Kroll, any further online participants?

50:52.189 --> 50:54.071
No further online participants.

50:54.091 --> 50:55.152
Any

50:55.807 --> 51:00.394
Uh, members of the public who'd like to make comments, feel free to come up to the podium.

51:03.879 --> 51:04.420
Seeing none.

51:04.460 --> 51:06.243
Were there any emailed comments, Mr. Carl?

51:06.423 --> 51:07.124
There were a number.

51:07.144 --> 51:10.329
I am not going to go through all 46 and read the names.

51:10.509 --> 51:17.420
However, you received 36 letters with respect to Northwest rail and the conversation that you held earlier today.

51:17.480 --> 51:22.287
Five letters with respect to the policy you will consider later this evening.

51:22.655 --> 51:29.586
Three letters with respect to Title VI policy or the program update that you all will consider later this evening.

51:30.268 --> 51:40.745
One regarding the National Women's Soccer League proposed stadium that was discussed earlier here in person and one regarding paratransit AOD program modifications.

51:41.346 --> 51:43.870
All will be appended to the transcript of this meeting.

51:44.170 --> 51:56.851
and just as a reminder to directors, a majority of these written public comment, comments were submitted to the RTD.directors email group, which you all have access to and can see in real time.

51:57.732 --> 51:58.634
Thank you, Mr. Kroll.

51:58.934 --> 52:02.981
With no other participants in the queue, we'll now close public participation at this time.

52:04.203 --> 52:07.127
Moving on to our next item, external entities report.

52:07.147 --> 52:10.633
We have no external entity reports this month.

52:11.812 --> 52:13.954
Moving on to our next item, discussion items.

52:14.354 --> 52:22.001
We have one discussion item on the agenda this evening, which is a holdover from last week's operation safety and security committee meeting.

52:22.021 --> 52:24.864
It is the access on demand program modifications.

52:25.565 --> 52:31.430
I would like to offer the floor to GMCO Deborah Johnson for some opening remarks before introducing Ms.

52:31.750 --> 52:32.231
Vallejo's.

52:33.632 --> 52:35.173
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

52:35.654 --> 52:40.418
Good afternoon or evening, board members, Deborah Johnson, general manager and chief executive officer.

52:41.073 --> 52:49.404
I am joined by Aaron Valleos, who serves as the acting assistant, deputy assistant general manager of bus operations.

52:49.885 --> 53:02.862
And as indicated in your remarks, we are here referencing the previous agendized topic at the operation safety and security committee that we did not get to and wanted to have this conversation

53:03.196 --> 53:14.791
with you all this evening, the intent of this presentation is to ground all board members in our paratransit programs.

53:14.811 --> 53:32.713
But more specifically, what we are seeking from this body is some guidance relative to access on demand, which is a supplemental premium service as relates to paratransit services, not the American with Disabilities Act of 1990, Complementary Paratransit Services.

53:32.693 --> 53:38.542
And in doing so, this conversation will help us guide our path forward.

53:39.603 --> 53:49.838
Specifically, I think what's notable for everybody to understand that the current paratransit contracts that we have for access on demand do sunset at the end of December.

53:50.399 --> 53:55.647
We have had conversations relative to modifications and absence of having some guidance

53:55.627 --> 54:07.345
We run the risk of not having any type of services and hence why it's so imperative is that we adhere to open and fair competition in order to do a solicitation relative to services.

54:07.405 --> 54:15.377
We have to have some guidance relative to the specifications that would be included in a solicitation for a request for proposal.

54:15.898 --> 54:23.389
So this is not for you to make a decision relative to where we are but provide guidance because what we anticipate doing with said guidance

54:23.369 --> 54:29.119
And bringing forward these scenarios after meeting with some board members i.e.

54:29.880 --> 54:41.901
Chair Ruscha and Director Chandler that are both on the operation safety and security committee is to seek that direction so we can then go out to

54:42.218 --> 54:46.706
The customer segments and garner a better understanding while we've heard comments here.

54:47.467 --> 54:58.607
We have taken part in a myriad of different public participation engagements and want to ensure that we are being good fiscal stewards, but also ensuring that we are providing the independence.

54:58.908 --> 55:05.599
and ability for all aspects of our population to be able to travel and move about to and fro.

55:05.619 --> 55:08.944
So, with that being said, I will yield the floor to Ms.

55:09.024 --> 55:11.708
Filaios to commence with the presentation.

55:11.748 --> 55:15.354
If we could have Board Office staff pull that up, that would be appreciated.

55:15.574 --> 55:15.955
Thank you.

55:34.801 --> 55:36.583
been a while since I've used these microphones.

55:37.183 --> 55:38.004
Good evening, everyone.

55:38.244 --> 55:45.972
As GM CEO Johnson said, I'm Erin Vallejoz, the acting deputy assistant general manager for bus operations.

55:46.553 --> 55:49.976
And we are just going to go over just kind of a quick overview.

55:50.056 --> 55:54.220
I think it's a lot of information that you've already seen, so we won't spend too much time on that.

55:54.961 --> 55:57.964
Just kind of hit on what the initial recommendation was that we made.

55:58.725 --> 56:04.150
Talk about some revised recommendations, and then again, kind of open it up for discussion to kind of get

56:04.130 --> 56:06.152
an idea of some direction.

56:06.593 --> 56:06.773
Ms.

56:06.793 --> 56:09.577
Faleos, could you speak a little closer to the microphone?

56:09.917 --> 56:10.638
Yes, I can.

56:10.658 --> 56:11.259
Thank you so much.

56:11.279 --> 56:12.100
Of course.

56:12.140 --> 56:24.315
Okay, so just to kind of highlight on this again, as GM CEO Johnson said, accessoride and access on demand are the two programs that we have.

56:24.535 --> 56:31.183
Accessoride is RTD's federally required ADA complementary paratransit service.

56:31.163 --> 56:34.270
It does supplement our fixed route services.

56:34.851 --> 56:46.978
There is a fair payment required for these services and customers must meet the criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to be eligible.

56:46.958 --> 56:53.686
This is provided with all RTD branded access ride vehicles that are all 100% accessible.

56:54.507 --> 56:59.372
And then access on demand is our supplemental premium paratransit service.

57:00.153 --> 57:03.938
It is a curb to curb taxi and ride share service.

57:04.638 --> 57:07.642
It is available to current paratransit customers.

57:07.762 --> 57:16.392
So they must meet those eligibility criteria to qualify for access ride to then use access on demand.

57:16.372 --> 57:22.786
And as it stands today, RTD pays the first $25 of the trip and the remaining portion is paid by the customer.

57:23.668 --> 57:27.597
And again, ability today to take 60 total trips.

57:28.336 --> 57:30.640
So just some quick operating statistics.

57:30.820 --> 57:38.695
The annual operating cost in 2024 for excessive ride was just over 53 million and the customer trips were just over 500,000.

57:38.835 --> 57:48.252
And again, these are RTD owned vehicles and the contractors that operate this service have over 500 drivers mechanics and other staff.

57:48.232 --> 57:53.823
And then access on demand slash year it was about just over 15 3 million for the budget.

57:56.008 --> 58:01.178
Just over 685,000 trips and these are all provided by third party vehicles.

58:03.031 --> 58:09.358
So again, as we touched on, you must be eligible for access ride to also use access on demand.

58:10.639 --> 58:20.069
There is a process that customers must go through that determines if a customer has a disabling condition that would prevent them from using a regular fixed route service.

58:21.050 --> 58:28.178
There's an application process, a medical verification process, and then an in-person assessment that customers must complete.

58:28.158 --> 58:32.563
And there are a couple of different types of eligibility that a customer could receive.

58:32.744 --> 58:38.290
Unconditional means you can have access to the full service for up to four years.

58:38.831 --> 58:44.638
Temporary, you might have a condition that's going to improve recovering from surgery or something along those lines.

58:45.239 --> 58:51.547
And then conditional would be when there was something maybe you're sensitive to extreme hot or extreme cold.

58:52.047 --> 58:55.752
So you would be able to use it at those times, but not the full year.

58:57.537 --> 59:03.564
Okay, and as we have touched on, this is something that you've probably seen as well.

59:04.324 --> 59:08.489
We are continuing to see an increase in access on demand usage.

59:09.030 --> 59:16.077
This is through 2024, but we continue to see that access on demand trend line going up into the start of this year.

59:16.097 --> 59:25.688
And access ride, when you look at the trend line, while it is staying a little bit more stable, we are still seeing an increase in usage there as well.

59:27.862 --> 59:37.178
And as we've talked about, average monthly trips per customer, the majority of customers are falling into the category of taking up to 50 trips.

59:37.198 --> 59:41.165
That is about 90% of the customers when we lasted the analysis.

59:41.686 --> 59:47.035
And about 10% of the customers, again, fall into that 51 to 60 category.

59:48.989 --> 59:54.267
So now I'm going to just remind everyone of what our initial recommendations were back in 2024.

59:54.367 --> 01:00:00.467
As it stands today again quickly, there's a zero dollar base customer fair.

01:00:00.768 --> 01:00:05.074
The trip cap is 60 per month, subsidy is up to $25 per trip.

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:10.623
It is available within the entire district and it is available 24 seven.

01:00:11.384 --> 01:00:25.885
Back when we came to you in November of 2024, we had proposed making changes and this involved having a $4.50 based customer fair, which would be $2.25 for our live eligible customers.

01:00:26.466 --> 01:00:29.070
We proposed a trip cap of 40 per month.

01:00:30.282 --> 01:00:38.271
The subsidy would go to $20 per trip, and then it was proposed to mirror both the current service area and the service hours.

01:00:40.233 --> 01:00:48.803
With this recommendation, there were going to be cost savings that the district would realize, and that was going to be about $5.8 million.

01:00:50.184 --> 01:00:58.213
So instead of the projected yearly spend being a little bit over $15 million, we would go down to about 9.4.

01:01:01.957 --> 01:01:09.467
Okay, and as a result of some of the feedback and comments that we've heard, we did put together two additional revised scenarios.

01:01:09.487 --> 01:01:12.932
So scenario one is what I'm going to touch on first.

01:01:13.152 --> 01:01:16.777
So this has to do with an increased trip cap approach.

01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:25.990
So what we were proposing in this scenario is increasing the trip cap to 50 per month from the original 40 that was proposed.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:38.128
We are proposing, as this is, again, as we've said, a premium supplemental service, a fare of $6.50 per trip, which would be $3.25 for our live customers.

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.573
Then the remainder of the proposal does remain the same.

01:01:41.713 --> 01:01:53.530
We were still proposing a subsidy per trip of $20, and we are proposing mirroring the current service area and service hours as that of our accessory program.

01:01:54.303 --> 01:02:10.033
With this program, we did see actually a little bit of the yearly impact would be a cost savings of about 6.1 million, bringing our total spend to about 9 points, a little over 9.1.

01:02:10.013 --> 01:02:27.550
With the 50 trips, that does allow for customers to still have, given there's about 20 weekdays in a month, that does allow for customers to still travel to work, but then does allow for some ancillary trips throughout the month.

01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:36.545
And then another scenario that we had put together is the tiered approach that we have discussed.

01:02:37.206 --> 01:02:44.715
With this approach, we would still maintain a trip cap of up to 60 trips per month, which matches what we have currently.

01:02:45.676 --> 01:02:50.922
There would be a $4.50 based customer fare for up to 30 trips.

01:02:50.902 --> 01:02:57.162
$5.50 for 31 to 50, and $6.50 for 51 to 60.

01:02:57.804 --> 01:03:01.215
And the remainder of the recommendation would remain the same.

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:22.681
With this program, as some people have noted, due to kind of the program structure and some of the manual aspects that exist with monitoring today, there would be an increase in staff oversight that would result in additional staff headcounts, again, that had been noted.

01:03:22.821 --> 01:03:27.287
But as it stands today, the program does require quite a bit of manual intervention.

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:36.386
There is also, as someone mentioned, the customers would need to be keeping a little bit closer track of their trips, and that could lead to confusion.

01:03:36.867 --> 01:03:42.901
It is something a customer would have to be regularly thinking, all right, where am I at for the month?

01:03:43.362 --> 01:03:46.930
Have I hit that 30 trips so they know what to expect for their costs?

01:03:48.749 --> 01:03:53.677
With this program, we would see some reductions of just over $5 million.

01:03:53.757 --> 01:03:58.124
So it is a little bit less than some of the other recommendations that we've put forth.

01:03:58.665 --> 01:04:04.515
And it would bring our projected yearly spend to about $10.28 million a year.

01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:09.002
And actually,

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:20.506
So proposed next steps we are here as GM CEO Johnson has said to just kind of garner everyone's feedback and get some guidance on a path forward.

01:04:21.067 --> 01:04:27.683
The intent is to do outreach and engagement in June based on some of that guidance and engage with the community.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:38.512
We would be coming back for board consideration in July with an actual recommended action to the committee and then provided the committee advanced it at the board meeting.

01:04:38.572 --> 01:04:44.157
And we would begin implementation in August with full implementation in October.

01:04:44.197 --> 01:04:47.961
And with that, I will open it up.

01:04:49.082 --> 01:04:49.962
Perfect.

01:04:49.982 --> 01:04:51.704
Thank you very much for your presentation, Ms.

01:04:51.744 --> 01:04:52.204
Vallejoz.

01:04:53.165 --> 01:04:55.287
Okay, I'm going to open it up for directors.

01:04:55.567 --> 01:04:56.488
Second Vice Chair Whitmore.

01:04:57.616 --> 01:05:02.403
Thank you for the presentation and the ease of absorbing the proposed changes.

01:05:03.264 --> 01:05:15.781
Erin, looking at the second proposal, the tiered approach, one of our commenters talked about the complications of keeping up with number of trips.

01:05:16.522 --> 01:05:21.970
Is that something that the new staff would be able to be

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:47.704
Clearinghouse if you will to worry have one call to RTD instead of calling a taxi and a lift and an Uber That seems to be the most difficult part of that I'm just curious if you think our staff would be handling that in a way that would be handy for our customers It's definitely something I think we could assist with but I do think there would still be some burden on the customer for having some of that responsibility and

01:05:48.207 --> 01:05:53.776
Again, as I mentioned, as it stands today, there is just a very manual aspect of the program.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:06:02.690
And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.

01:06:04.934 --> 01:06:05.575
Thank you.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:07.961
Thank you.

01:06:07.981 --> 01:06:10.304
And thank you for a very clear presentation.

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:14.110
Although I have one question of clarification.

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:17.234
You talk about mirroring the existing service area.

01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:33.537
One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that I don't think that the customers were restricted to the three quarter mile within a fixed route.

01:06:34.225 --> 01:06:35.566
Would that change with this?

01:06:36.207 --> 01:06:42.013
Any of these proposals or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?

01:06:42.033 --> 01:06:51.082
As the pro the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the three quarter of a mile boundary that exists today for our accessory customers.

01:06:54.645 --> 01:06:55.206
Okay, that.

01:06:57.828 --> 01:07:01.151
That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.

01:07:01.372 --> 01:07:01.752
Thank you.

01:07:03.993 --> 01:07:05.056
Secretary Nicholson.

01:07:07.101 --> 01:07:08.504
Thank you very much.

01:07:08.805 --> 01:07:15.923
I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.

01:07:17.407 --> 01:07:20.635
We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify.

01:07:20.902 --> 01:07:23.426
for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:36.065
There are commuter routes and I would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.

01:07:36.126 --> 01:07:42.556
So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.

01:07:42.596 --> 01:07:44.158
Otherwise, Peggy has like

01:07:44.797 --> 01:07:48.546
two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.

01:07:48.566 --> 01:07:51.673
There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.

01:07:52.675 --> 01:08:01.455
I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of, you know,

01:08:01.756 --> 01:08:31.003
We'll not call it rural but mountainous Jefferson County When it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver the trips I can get to most places that I need to go You know in terms of grocery stores medical etc in a $15 Uber, you know, I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to For 15 bucks in Peggy's district Or yours exactly and so

01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:36.417
But creating a system where the trip cap is 40 bucks doesn't work for me.

01:08:36.497 --> 01:08:41.945
Creating a trip cap where it's 15 bucks doesn't work for the people in her district.

01:08:42.005 --> 01:08:53.662
It strikes me that the right approach would be to have different levels of financial cap and different levels of trip cap to go along with them and let people pick.

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:55.725
You want 60 trips at

01:08:55.942 --> 01:08:57.044
$15 per.

01:08:57.505 --> 01:08:57.746
Great.

01:08:57.826 --> 01:09:00.391
You want 50 trips at $20 per.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:00.772
Great.

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:03.738
You want 40 trips at $30 per.

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:04.359
Great.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.481
Depends on where you live.

01:09:05.521 --> 01:09:07.465
Depends on the types of trips you're going to be taking.

01:09:07.545 --> 01:09:17.545
But making people all fit into one size is either going to leave her people paying $20 for every single trip that they take.

01:09:17.525 --> 01:09:26.802
or it's going to put people in my district in a reduced number of rides because very few trips are going to cost $20 or $25.

01:09:26.882 --> 01:09:28.925
So those are my two pieces of feedback.

01:09:28.946 --> 01:09:31.410
Thank you.

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:32.211
Thank you, Secretary.

01:09:33.013 --> 01:09:33.694
Dr. Ruscha.

01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:39.013
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

01:09:40.174 --> 01:09:44.719
So I just wanted to offer a bit of context.

01:09:44.739 --> 01:09:49.645
And the general manager, please interrupt me if I'm framing this wrong.

01:09:50.025 --> 01:09:56.312
But the conversation that we're having tonight is a framework of a potential path forward.

01:09:56.993 --> 01:10:03.360
And because of our OSS meeting went so long,

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:33.195
we weren't able to get to through the discussion and that also I think impacted our ability to have some interim discussions so I just want folks to you know keep keep an open mind to what staff is saying and definitely share that feedback because we're on a timeline but also just recognize that well and please if I'm saying this wrong interrupt but what is being presented is a concept framework um and so we want so we'll get board feedback and then of course staff is going to be working very closely

01:10:33.513 --> 01:10:40.945
with our existing customers and advocacy organizations to make further refinements and give us some more stuff to look at.

01:10:41.005 --> 01:10:48.116
So I hope I didn't speak out of turn, but I just wanted to offer that for context.

01:10:48.877 --> 01:11:01.377
And I'm also listening and taking notes and I know staff is, so I would just urge if anyone has thoughts one way or another, please share them tonight since we are also on

01:11:01.643 --> 01:11:05.050
timeline with our existing partners and those contracts as well.

01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:05.992
Thank you.

01:11:07.114 --> 01:11:07.776
Thank you, Director.

01:11:08.577 --> 01:11:09.239
Director Larson.

01:11:12.886 --> 01:11:13.307
Thank you.

01:11:13.447 --> 01:11:15.792
I just have a question for Ms.

01:11:15.812 --> 01:11:16.253
Vallejos.

01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:21.103
So I saw, I see in one of those slot these slides that it says there's

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:29.900
In December of 2024, there were about 2,900 total active customers of access on demand.

01:11:30.982 --> 01:11:36.128
So there were 2,900 people, roughly, who used it in all of December.

01:11:36.929 --> 01:11:37.429
Is that right?

01:11:38.751 --> 01:11:41.394
I know that would be for the year, I believe.

01:11:42.736 --> 01:11:42.996
Let me just.

01:11:43.076 --> 01:11:43.877
OK.

01:11:44.017 --> 01:11:48.803
So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year.

01:11:49.084 --> 01:11:49.504
That's it.

01:11:50.429 --> 01:12:03.173
And then, and so, so, so, so I guess what I'm trying to just understand is so we, if we were going to spend say 10 million or $15 million on 2,900 people.

01:12:03.592 --> 01:12:08.619
What do we think the equivalent is for sort of just our regular writers?

01:12:08.959 --> 01:12:09.901
Do we have any guess?

01:12:10.521 --> 01:12:12.885
I mean, I know, you know, people have different ridership.

01:12:12.925 --> 01:12:27.284
I'm just trying to get, I mean, do we have like a, if we have a million customers a year and it's sort of the majority of our budget, I'm just trying to get a sense of how the per person spend for a regular writer compares to the per person spend for access on demand.

01:12:28.145 --> 01:12:31.590
And I, go ahead Deborah.

01:12:33.393 --> 01:12:36.861
So if I can, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question.

01:12:37.162 --> 01:12:39.588
I would not want us to conjecture and speculate.

01:12:39.668 --> 01:12:41.493
We could double back and give you those numbers.

01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:48.088
As we talk about, you use the term regular writer, you're talking about those that are using fixed route service.

01:12:48.129 --> 01:12:51.216
I just want to be clear and intentional with the language we're using going forward.

01:12:51.196 --> 01:13:00.006
So we need to assess that because it's a different level of service because with fixed route bus, we're not providing curb to curb service.

01:13:00.366 --> 01:13:04.310
And so we can double back and share that information with the board.

01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:09.356
But I think it wouldn't be fruitful for us to guesstimate because this is critically important.

01:13:09.736 --> 01:13:15.222
But as we come back and we have some guidance, we could provide that detailed information, if you will.

01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:15.983
Thank you.

01:13:17.965 --> 01:13:19.026
Thank you.

01:13:20.356 --> 01:13:22.421
Any other directors comments?

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:23.243
Yeah, director Guzman.

01:13:24.185 --> 01:13:31.723
So I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area.

01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:38.179
District C is fairly blessed with

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:47.521
multiple forms of transit and fixed route, where this is not a particular problem, but it is an issue in the suburban areas of the region.

01:13:47.961 --> 01:14:01.602
And it is highly concerning that we would restrict it so much where people would be left off of the system that live within a quarter mile of a commuter bus and still not be able to access this.

01:14:04.113 --> 01:14:16.449
I also think that as we proceed into the future after the demographers presentation to the finance and planning committee, a big concern will be our aging population in the region.

01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:22.456
And it's a, you know, somebody said that this is a drop in the bucket for our budget.

01:14:23.698 --> 01:14:33.951
Maybe right now, but eventually this is going to catch up with us, which is why we're having this conversation and access on demand and folks that are able to

01:14:34.302 --> 01:14:48.752
Um, or out of need, uh, utilize this system, um, need to be considered as humans first and how we serve them, which is our mission, right?

01:14:48.812 --> 01:14:50.235
They need connection as well.

01:14:50.958 --> 01:15:04.393
and not every one of them will be able to jump from a jump, roll, walk, shuffle to a fixed route form of transportation to get them to their destinations.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:11.942
I have a question about the time on this, right?

01:15:12.363 --> 01:15:17.168
If it's mirroring regular service provision for the whole region,

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:26.220
It kind of makes sense, but I would still be concerned for the reasons that emergencies don't happen on RTD schedule.

01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:36.253
And so somebody who already has a specific need for this type of transportation usage might need to go to the doctor.

01:15:36.774 --> 01:15:39.477
And what do they do if they're unable to drive?

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:44.310
And regular bus service is not something that they can use because the buses aren't running.

01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:50.543
A two o'clock in the morning emergency room visit is not unheard of and not uncommon in anybody's life.

01:15:51.085 --> 01:15:53.871
And yet what do we do to take care of those that are most vulnerable.

01:15:55.234 --> 01:15:58.461
So for me, I would really want to see some clarity around.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.902
those two areas.

01:16:01.044 --> 01:16:06.533
I am frankly less concerned about minimal difference of cost savings.

01:16:07.474 --> 01:16:09.558
I mean, we're talking $5 million.

01:16:10.039 --> 01:16:16.129
This not really the top priority for me on that part.

01:16:16.531 --> 01:16:21.460
right now, it will eventually get there because this will likely continue to grow.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:28.892
But I do want to make sure that we are basing ourselves in reality to serve the taxpayers needs.

01:16:29.714 --> 01:16:32.358
And this is a need, right?

01:16:32.378 --> 01:16:37.988
This is not a desire as some of the other services we want to grow and create are this one is an actual need.

01:16:38.749 --> 01:16:41.374
And so I want to be clear in my language on that and why I'm

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:44.765
depositing these comments within that framework.

01:16:45.106 --> 01:16:46.310
So that would be my feedback.

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:50.846
I'd like to see something a little bit different on those two things, the service area and the time for service.

01:16:51.027 --> 01:16:51.328
Thank you.

01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:52.612
Thank you, Director.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:53.997
Director Harwick.

01:16:54.972 --> 01:16:57.255
Well, thank you, Director Guzman.

01:16:57.275 --> 01:16:59.597
I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you just said.

01:16:59.617 --> 01:17:08.988
I represent Arvada, and Arvada is actually the fastest growing aging population.

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:10.390
However, I said that.

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.351
I'm not sure I said it right.

01:17:12.012 --> 01:17:17.458
And a lot of our service is not in the areas where we have those aging people.

01:17:18.039 --> 01:17:20.642
So I'd really like to see

01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:23.272
just the boundary kept the same.

01:17:23.392 --> 01:17:28.318
I'm also really again with director Guzman keeping it as a full 24 seven.

01:17:28.338 --> 01:17:44.757
I just like I have a friend in a wheelchair and I just think about her trying like if she didn't live where she lived if she lived where I live she would have such a difficult time getting you know around her community and I won't just

01:17:45.260 --> 01:18:01.986
especially like if if the service is outside of that time period it's just precluding her life and I know we don't all have these the same abilities when we're riding the bus but for a person with this ability that's blind or in a wheelchair I think that we can sort of extend them the grace that they deserve.

01:18:02.843 --> 01:18:05.307
I also would like to see the cap stay at 60.

01:18:05.327 --> 01:18:18.650
I think that, again, I know that it's a, you know, less than 10% of the population go above the 50 rides, but I think it's still like that's, we're giving them access to a free and full life.

01:18:19.712 --> 01:18:27.906
And I think if we are going to go with the 650, I think that that to me is fine, but I also think that it would be imperative that we, that we really,

01:18:27.886 --> 01:18:49.658
Put out the live program and let let those riders know That there is another option like there's always with someone the other day she Lives about three miles away from where she works and you know She can afford it, but just barely and she didn't know about the live program So I think that there's we're missing an opportunity there specifically with these

01:18:49.638 --> 01:18:50.940
with these writers.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.604
So, and then my last one is just a request.

01:18:53.624 --> 01:19:10.187
Is it possible to get a map, like sort of like a density map of where AOD is like highly being used to sort of go with that, like thinking about, you know, West Jefferson County versus Central Denver, just kind of see what that looks like.

01:19:10.267 --> 01:19:17.738
Obviously we want to anonymize the data, but I think it sort of just would be interesting for us to know where the sort of hotspots of usage are.

01:19:18.393 --> 01:19:18.733
Thank you.

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:19.474
Thank you, Director Harwick.

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:19.855
Ms.

01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:20.255
Johnson.

01:19:21.397 --> 01:19:39.739
Yes, Director Harwick, if I understood you correctly, as I'm taking copious notes here, you are in support for all intents and purposes of what I hear, the modification of scenario one, keeping it at 60 trips with 650 and then one information relative to what the current usage is from a geographic vantage point.

01:19:40.259 --> 01:19:40.680
Okay.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:41.040
Thank you.

01:19:42.221 --> 01:19:42.922
Thank you.

01:19:42.942 --> 01:19:46.967
Yeah, but I also want to keep the service areas the same as they are today.

01:19:47.508 --> 01:19:47.708
Yeah.

01:19:49.713 --> 01:19:51.617
Excellent.

01:19:51.637 --> 01:19:54.804
Director Nicholson, then Director Ruscha.

01:19:54.884 --> 01:19:58.551
Yeah, just a quick follow up onto that.

01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:06.909
When it comes to go to Director Ruscha, my brain, I lost my train of thought for a second, so.

01:20:08.151 --> 01:20:08.953
All right, Director Ruscha.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.962
Thank you for the red rover.

01:20:15.022 --> 01:20:15.804
I wasn't prepared.

01:20:15.824 --> 01:20:16.725
I went back to my notes.

01:20:17.206 --> 01:20:24.139
OK, so anyway, some of this feedback I did share with staff.

01:20:24.379 --> 01:20:32.173
And I don't want to be repetitive, but I also just want to be really transparent with my colleagues, because we haven't had this public conversation yet.

01:20:32.609 --> 01:20:49.935
And just high level, some of the things that I had shared was, you know, first of all, we don't want to put one proposal out before the community and get feedback like the one that we've had out for several months and then come back with something else that looks like less than what we originally proposed.

01:20:50.016 --> 01:20:52.980
And so one of the pain points that I had was just the idea of

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:57.185
going up to 650 for the initial fare because that's not what we originally put out there.

01:20:57.526 --> 01:21:08.377
So one of the things that I urge is that if we put an offer on the table, so to speak, we don't take it back.

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:10.440
That's kind of our baseline now.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.386
And another piece of feedback I had is that where something is not

01:21:18.188 --> 01:21:30.760
For every change we make, which essentially results in a reduction of a service of some kind or an increase in price, we really have to justify that line by line.

01:21:31.121 --> 01:21:39.549
So for example, if we decide that we are going to strictly align with service hours, then we have to justify it.

01:21:39.569 --> 01:21:41.050
It doesn't cost us any more money.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.271
It's not going to save us a penny.

01:21:42.692 --> 01:21:46.035
If somebody uses on demand,

01:21:46.859 --> 01:21:51.295
15 or 20 minutes or an hour before fixed drought starts.

01:21:52.961 --> 01:21:58.000
Likewise, it's not costing us that I could see a lot of money, if any.

01:21:58.233 --> 01:22:02.720
for us to offer service outside of our general service area.

01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:06.706
I know that was flagged in the peer review.

01:22:07.046 --> 01:22:26.055
So I, because this idea has been on the table for so many months, I also want to caution us about the service area idea because if we restrict the service, that means there are people who currently are using AOD and they're going to lose it.

01:22:26.756 --> 01:22:27.177
So

01:22:28.118 --> 01:22:38.814
I, um, so that was just, I mean, that was just the, the kind of like high level, like, um, theme that I had in, in the feedback.

01:22:39.435 --> 01:22:52.675
Um, and also, you know, I'm going back to the, uh, initial like a fair, um, we also want to be really careful about what we think.

01:22:53.043 --> 01:23:15.743
is inexpensive because it's really relative so for some folks using the service and they have like a fixed income or very limited income if we even do you know 450 which is on which would be parity with excess right and I think I could accept that but like say we go up to 650 or we do this tiered system

01:23:16.297 --> 01:23:24.685
then for some folks, they are not going to be able to write or they're going to be choosing, do I get to the doctor or do I buy food for tonight?

01:23:24.865 --> 01:23:28.548
So I just wanted to put that out there.

01:23:28.969 --> 01:23:38.758
And finally, well, actually, I'll stop there.

01:23:38.778 --> 01:23:46.185
I concurred with what a lot of other directors said in terms of keeping the program as is as much as we can.

01:23:46.874 --> 01:23:59.082
I think that, but I also just want to commend staff, you know, because we are at a much different place than where we were several months ago.

01:23:59.724 --> 01:24:01.508
This is a totally different conversation.

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:03.791
really slashing this program.

01:24:04.592 --> 01:24:10.057
And staff did a lot of work and we spent several months, we almost voted on this a few months ago.

01:24:10.097 --> 01:24:18.964
And they listened to us as directors and they listened to community because as you know, we've had hundreds of public comments over several months on this.

01:24:19.605 --> 01:24:27.472
And they said, okay, we can take a timeout, we can reassess, we can get some different data, we can, you know, kind of present a new paradigm.

01:24:27.492 --> 01:24:31.275
So again, what's before us today is a sketch of ideas, the feedback is good.

01:24:31.542 --> 01:24:36.572
But I really do want to commend staff for listening and working with us in partnership.

01:24:36.592 --> 01:24:37.533
So thank you.

01:24:37.554 --> 01:24:38.916
And thank you.

01:24:40.098 --> 01:24:40.960
Thank you, Director Ruscha.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:41.882
Director Nicholson.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.607
Thank you.

01:24:45.953 --> 01:25:00.857
Is there any step during enrollment of AAR and AOD where we ask people if they are enrolled in the live program and ask them, hey, we're taking 14 other pieces of documentation from you.

01:25:00.877 --> 01:25:04.824
I mean, AAR is remarkably complicated to sign up for.

01:25:04.884 --> 01:25:11.755
Is there any part of that process where we try to enroll them in the live program as well?

01:25:11.795 --> 01:25:12.957
And then I have a quick follow up.

01:25:17.678 --> 01:25:20.281
I will have to find out about that as part of the process.

01:25:20.681 --> 01:25:25.587
Um, and we will confirm if that is, you know, how that is handled as, as part of the process.

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:26.968
Yeah.

01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:37.280
So, yeah, as a, as a first thing I would say that, since we're going to be updating this to offer the, the live discount and, and not make it free, uh, it should be required as part of the process.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:45.829
If you're going through to sign up for AOD or AA or some point in that process to set, to ask someone to affirm that they are either already signed up or,

01:25:46.079 --> 01:25:50.424
haven't signed up, or whatever, and then give them the opportunity to make it super easy.

01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:57.052
Because we only have 15,000 people signed up for live right now, and we have 180-something thousand boardrooms every day.

01:25:57.193 --> 01:26:03.701
And I think only about half the people in AOD are currently signed up for, or AAR, currently signed up for live.

01:26:03.761 --> 01:26:06.144
So definitely something I'd like to see there.

01:26:06.164 --> 01:26:15.495
The second thing, I want to echo what Director Ruscha said about the effect on people who

01:26:16.049 --> 01:26:32.151
are low income to having these fares, but I want to take it from the other side, which is if you don't have a lot of money and you need to get around to a lot of places, then 40 trips maybe, or whatever the number ends up being, not nearly enough in a way that someone who makes more money

01:26:32.131 --> 01:26:35.476
can probably have some discretionary to be like, oh, I've run out of trips.

01:26:35.576 --> 01:26:38.801
I can afford to take an extra three or five or whatever.

01:26:38.841 --> 01:26:42.968
So I'm not sure that that needs to be fit into the policy here.

01:26:43.028 --> 01:26:45.552
I'm wary about trying to do too much too quickly.

01:26:45.892 --> 01:26:56.408
But I do think we need to get a report from you after, I don't know, six months a year that looks at how many trips are people on live using?

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:58.011
Are they maxing out?

01:26:58.031 --> 01:27:00.214
Or are we seeing sort of the same curve?

01:27:00.194 --> 01:27:12.873
from live users as we do from regular users right now, and that might inform us to take action a year from now to try to offer the right service for people who need it.

01:27:12.913 --> 01:27:14.956
Some live people make decent incomes.

01:27:15.117 --> 01:27:22.508
Some of them are literally broke, and we need to recognize that those two groups of people have very different lived experiences.

01:27:23.209 --> 01:27:24.090
Thank you, Secretary.

01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:24.331
Ms.

01:27:24.371 --> 01:27:24.691
Johnson?

01:27:25.092 --> 01:27:27.315
Yes, thank you very much, Director Nicholson.

01:27:27.717 --> 01:27:28.779
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

01:27:28.799 --> 01:27:30.942
Thank you, Director Nicholson, for the comments.

01:27:31.403 --> 01:27:35.509
And what I will say in reference to your request, it appeared to be a directive.

01:27:35.849 --> 01:27:45.203
But I would just offer this up to you that once we collectively agree upon the path forward in this Board acts, we can then assess what might be most prudent.

01:27:45.223 --> 01:27:48.028
Because at this point in time, we don't know what we don't know.

01:27:48.068 --> 01:27:53.836
And relative to what you just asked, I can't commit to that without knowing what we intend to do.

01:27:53.996 --> 01:27:55.699
So I just had to say that for the record.

01:27:55.915 --> 01:28:00.620
because it seemed as if Miss Vallejo's was giving direction and I don't think that's appropriate at this juncture.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.341
Thank you.

01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:03.163
Thank you.

01:28:03.183 --> 01:28:03.243
Ms.

01:28:03.263 --> 01:28:03.863
Director Larson.

01:28:05.605 --> 01:28:06.026
Thank you.

01:28:06.046 --> 01:28:12.613
I just, I was just kind of doing, doing some, some stuff on my calculator.

01:28:12.713 --> 01:28:23.104
And so if we only have 3000 people who use excess, excess on demand, I mean, it seems like the disabled population,

01:28:23.422 --> 01:28:29.312
You know, it might be 300,000 people in Denver or something, you know, much, much larger.

01:28:30.775 --> 01:28:37.366
Do we, how do, how confident are we of our projection that it'll stay at around, I mean, or, or however much we think it'll increase?

01:28:37.386 --> 01:28:48.906
I mean, what do we think the total number of active users might become and why won't it become, you know, several, many multiples more than 3,000 or so?

01:28:54.522 --> 01:29:03.333
First, if I may, just for everyone's edification, you probably have heard this over the course of several months in the public comment discussions.

01:29:04.034 --> 01:29:19.213
When we talk about access on demand, currently as it's configured, recognizing that we're using private entities, transportation network companies in particular, not all of the vehicles are outfitted to be wheelchair accessible.

01:29:19.497 --> 01:29:27.266
So that's a critical element when we're talking about the population because there's different disabilities that individuals have.

01:29:27.366 --> 01:29:34.255
Some may have cognitive, somebody may be using a mobility device, which can't be accommodated going forward.

01:29:34.275 --> 01:29:37.198
So I just wanted to provide that context prior to Ms.

01:29:37.218 --> 01:29:42.084
Vallejo's answering the question because that has not been factored into this conversation this evening.

01:29:42.104 --> 01:29:43.466
And I believe it's a germane point.

01:29:45.508 --> 01:29:46.129
Thank you, Director.

01:29:46.632 --> 01:29:51.039
And I don't think I need to add anything that was really exactly what I was going to say.

01:29:51.059 --> 01:29:56.708
Not everyone is able to use the access on demand service that is eligible for accessoride.

01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:58.451
Other is a difference there.

01:29:59.152 --> 01:30:00.074
Can I just follow up?

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:07.045
But I mean, surely many more people than 3000 in the metro area would be eligible though.

01:30:08.547 --> 01:30:13.315
Well, and again, we have continued continue to see substantial growth.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:18.124
in the number of customers that are beginning to use the service.

01:30:18.585 --> 01:30:22.869
Again, the trips that we are seeing continue to grow even into this year.

01:30:22.929 --> 01:30:28.575
So we are seeing quite significant growth still.

01:30:28.595 --> 01:30:28.915
Thank you.

01:30:29.095 --> 01:30:29.456
Thank you.

01:30:29.476 --> 01:30:30.517
Thank you.

01:30:31.758 --> 01:30:33.219
Any further questions, comments?

01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.662
Ms.

01:30:35.702 --> 01:30:36.463
Johnson and Ms.

01:30:36.483 --> 01:30:38.485
Filaios, thank you very much for the presentation.

01:30:38.525 --> 01:30:40.827
I hope this was helpful feedback for going forward.

01:30:41.247 --> 01:30:41.968
So thank you.

01:30:42.573 --> 01:30:43.595
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.

01:30:43.695 --> 01:30:46.559
This was in the sense that we do have some guidance now.

01:30:46.639 --> 01:30:49.604
We know what we need to do as we do further outreach.

01:30:49.624 --> 01:30:51.988
So thank you all very much for the opportunity.

01:30:52.028 --> 01:31:02.184
And when we come back in July with a recommended action, hopefully we can all rally around that, recognizing the public comments that we heard in the direction in which you provide it.

01:31:02.204 --> 01:31:02.585
Thank you.

01:31:02.845 --> 01:31:03.166
Thank you.

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:04.227
Director Guzman.

01:31:04.628 --> 01:31:08.033
Will that recommended action be going through Operation Safety and Security?

01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:09.916
Ms.

01:31:09.936 --> 01:31:10.437
Johnson.

01:31:10.619 --> 01:31:15.169
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Guzman.

01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:17.575
I apologize for the question.

01:31:17.855 --> 01:31:20.441
Most definitely, we will go through the committee procedure.

01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:23.087
The only reason why this didn't happen because it's time sensitive.

01:31:23.548 --> 01:31:24.089
So thank you.

01:31:24.931 --> 01:31:25.592
Thank you very much.

01:31:26.775 --> 01:31:27.116
All right.

01:31:27.196 --> 01:31:28.258
Well, thank you again, Ms.

01:31:28.299 --> 01:31:29.421
Vallejoz.

01:31:29.637 --> 01:31:33.101
All right, moving on, thank you directors for the questions and conversations.

01:31:33.602 --> 01:31:39.549
We're gonna be moving to our committee reports, not to be the time, place or anything.

01:31:39.589 --> 01:31:43.053
We are at 831 PM and we've been going at this since 330.

01:31:43.613 --> 01:31:47.338
If committee reports could be less than a minute, that'd be greatly appreciated.

01:31:47.938 --> 01:31:51.122
Audit committee chair music, what would you like to share?

01:31:52.064 --> 01:31:52.866
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

01:31:52.906 --> 01:31:54.529
We did not meet in April or May.

01:31:54.549 --> 01:31:56.894
Our next meeting is June 12, 2025.

01:31:56.994 --> 01:31:58.056
That concludes my report.

01:31:58.437 --> 01:31:59.138
Thank you.

01:31:59.158 --> 01:31:59.860
Thank you very much.

01:32:01.804 --> 01:32:04.369
Finance and Planning Committee Report, Committee Chair Guzman.

01:32:04.602 --> 01:32:05.303
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

01:32:06.504 --> 01:32:14.053
The Finance Planning Committee met Tuesday, May 13th, discussed a handful of items, received a report from our state demographer, which was really awesome.

01:32:14.794 --> 01:32:22.983
Directors are reminded to email the board office if you had any follow-up questions or things specific to your sub-district so we can send that all at once to receive an answer to the whole board.

01:32:23.684 --> 01:32:32.955
Received an update from DOTI for the East Colfax BRT, and three items came out of committee, which will be before us tonight.

01:32:33.526 --> 01:32:35.470
just want to thank the committee for all of the hard work.

01:32:36.292 --> 01:32:44.909
And the next meeting for the finance and planning committee is scheduled for Tuesday, June 10th at 10.25, sorry, at 5.30pm.

01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:45.370
Thank you.

01:32:46.613 --> 01:32:47.174
Thank you, director.

01:32:48.357 --> 01:32:52.986
Committee chair Rucho or committee chair Harwick, what would you like to share for OSS?

01:32:53.962 --> 01:32:54.563
I'll take it, sir.

01:32:55.484 --> 01:32:55.825
Thank you.

01:32:55.865 --> 01:32:58.649
So we met remotely on Wednesday, May 14th.

01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:02.074
We gaveled in at 5.34 p.m.

01:33:02.234 --> 01:33:04.678
and wrapped up at 9.44 p.m.

01:33:05.319 --> 01:33:07.562
We had extensive public comments.

01:33:07.702 --> 01:33:10.046
The most I've ever seen at any OSS meeting.

01:33:11.087 --> 01:33:11.628
That was great.

01:33:11.708 --> 01:33:12.950
Come visit us anytime.

01:33:14.012 --> 01:33:18.298
It's always nice to know that people are listening to our podcast and by that I mean our YouTube channel.

01:33:18.278 --> 01:33:41.130
But two major items that went on the consent calendar for tonight's meeting is the 2025-2028 Title VI program update, just ensuring that we stay in compliance with federal law, civil rights protections, and meet the needs of our customers, as well as the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension.

01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:46.095
FNP authorized a budget transfer, which had no financial impact.

01:33:46.195 --> 01:33:48.098
It was just moving from one department to another.

01:33:48.598 --> 01:33:56.847
And then we filed that up with a vote to extend that contract for another year with the cost of up to just a little over 22 million.

01:33:57.628 --> 01:34:01.111
And we did have four discussion items, two of which were heard.

01:34:02.133 --> 01:34:06.257
So we had the Vision Zero update from GM CEO Johnson.

01:34:06.693 --> 01:34:11.720
As you might recall, we passed a Vision Zero resolution last year, and so that planning process is underway.

01:34:12.541 --> 01:34:14.805
We had a customer communications update.

01:34:15.506 --> 01:34:26.001
Stuart Summers led an excellent presentation, discussing how we handle communications, some tech updates, customer service aspects.

01:34:25.981 --> 01:34:29.366
real-time information and service alerts and things like that.

01:34:30.088 --> 01:34:37.439
Unfortunately, we did hit our four-hour mark before we could finish our agenda items, and even though the nuggets weren't playing, folks wanted to go, and we were tired.

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:48.377
So we moved the on-demand item to the nice meeting, which we just heard, and then we'll be hearing Paratransit Legacy Customer Protections proposal.

01:34:48.357 --> 01:34:48.998
next month.

01:34:49.599 --> 01:35:01.353
So for those of you who have been tracking what we're doing with paratransit, I strongly encourage you to come visit us at OSSX month and weigh in so we get your feedback before we come back with something more final.

01:35:02.214 --> 01:35:10.844
Our next meeting is Wednesday, June 11th at 5.30, same time, same place, online or on the phone.

01:35:11.625 --> 01:35:11.926
Thank you.

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:13.808
Thank you, committee chair.

01:35:14.227 --> 01:35:16.911
Uh, now to for performance committee chair Guzman.

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:17.912
I get it.

01:35:18.573 --> 01:35:19.454
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

01:35:19.895 --> 01:35:21.718
Performance committee met Monday, May 12th, 2025.

01:35:21.738 --> 01:35:37.500
Uh, I, I, the, the committee chair presented a draft proposal that I had worked on previously with vice chair Guchenruder for the 2025 general manager, CEO performance assessment form and process that needed to be updated to seek input from the committee and other directors.

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:49.954
to find a way forward for the rest of the year based on the current 2025 general manager CO short term goals and the respective adjustments made to the scoring points based on our votes in January.

01:35:50.508 --> 01:35:51.851
I've received some feedback.

01:35:52.031 --> 01:35:55.297
I continue to invite directors to submit the feedback.

01:35:55.337 --> 01:35:57.301
If you have not reviewed that meeting, please do so.

01:35:57.862 --> 01:36:00.567
And any questions you may have, please email me or call me.

01:36:00.868 --> 01:36:03.152
I am happy to engage in that conversation.

01:36:03.894 --> 01:36:12.330
Of course, we are doing that with participation and a lot of communication with the general manager CEO, Deborah Johnson.

01:36:12.698 --> 01:36:17.888
The next meeting of the performance committee is scheduled for June 2, 2025 at 8.30 a.m.

01:36:18.469 --> 01:36:23.659
I really want to encourage all of you directors to please participate in that meeting.

01:36:24.401 --> 01:36:24.902
Two reasons.

01:36:25.042 --> 01:36:26.725
One, we are going to receive.

01:36:27.346 --> 01:36:33.854
I hope I don't get this wrong because I don't have my work plan in front of me, but the employee survey results in the beginning of that meeting.

01:36:33.934 --> 01:36:41.183
And then we will adjourn into executive session for the second quarterly one-on-one opportunity with our general manager CEO.

01:36:41.724 --> 01:36:55.581
And that is part of our contracted agreement with the general manager CEO to receive information from her and provide feedback regarding personnel matters.

01:36:56.962 --> 01:37:04.231
Additionally, the performance committee is set to have a second meeting in June because of that quarterly check-in.

01:37:05.192 --> 01:37:10.058
The second meeting is planned, I believe, for June 23rd at 8.30 a.m.

01:37:10.118 --> 01:37:19.589
And that is in order to do a deep dive into our community and customer surveys, which align with our community value and customer excellent strategic initiatives.

01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:24.235
And I would again encourage all directors to participate in that meeting as well.

01:37:24.603 --> 01:37:31.529
which is the overview of the current status of the agency's surveys and where we're at with regard to public.

01:37:31.949 --> 01:37:39.716
It will inform the process for setting goals and priorities for the 2026 year, which we are also doing all at the same time.

01:37:39.916 --> 01:37:53.648
So prioritizing what is important for our customers, the survey reports are a great opportunity to engage with direct feedback from our constituents in all areas of the agency.

01:37:54.100 --> 01:38:00.614
I do believe a little birdie has told me on one of the buses that these should be really positive discussions.

01:38:01.295 --> 01:38:10.876
So if you need more than that invitation, please signal tonight and I will call you and email you and hound you to be on these meetings because I think they're really important for all of us.

01:38:10.916 --> 01:38:11.217
Thank you.

01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:14.083
Thank you, Committee Chair Guzman.

01:38:14.232 --> 01:38:15.074
Alright, moving on.

01:38:15.875 --> 01:38:19.121
We're going to do the approval of board meeting minutes and committee reports.

01:38:19.522 --> 01:38:23.269
The board and committee meeting minutes were included in the board packet.

01:38:23.991 --> 01:38:28.139
Are there any corrections from the board for the minutes to be approved this evening?

01:38:31.345 --> 01:38:31.866
Any corrections?

01:38:33.489 --> 01:38:37.236
Alright, unless there's objection to considering the minutes all the same time.

01:38:37.621 --> 01:38:40.584
My pleas have a motion to approve the minutes for the following meetings.

01:38:41.225 --> 01:38:44.509
The April 9th, 2025, Operation Safety and Security Committee.

01:38:45.029 --> 01:38:47.352
The April 29th, 2025 Board meeting.

01:38:47.912 --> 01:38:50.275
The May 12th, 2025 Performance Committee.

01:38:50.515 --> 01:38:52.798
May 13th, 2025 Finance and Planning Committee.

01:38:53.699 --> 01:38:56.642
May 14th, 2025, Operation Safety and Security Committee.

01:38:56.942 --> 01:38:59.845
And then May 22nd, 2025 Executive Committee.

01:39:00.246 --> 01:39:00.766
So moved.

01:39:00.786 --> 01:39:01.567
Guzman.

01:39:01.587 --> 01:39:02.528
The Guzman.

01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:03.890
Second.

01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:04.871
Second.

01:39:04.891 --> 01:39:06.733
I'm going to give it a gucci, right here.

01:39:09.211 --> 01:39:13.476
So I heard director Grew's moment as a mover and director Grew Turner as the second.

01:39:13.496 --> 01:39:14.917
Is there any discussion on this motion?

01:39:19.703 --> 01:39:20.223
Okay.

01:39:20.244 --> 01:39:21.885
Seeing none, I'll now call the vote.

01:39:22.006 --> 01:39:23.527
Are there any no votes on this action?

01:39:26.611 --> 01:39:26.751
Okay.

01:39:26.771 --> 01:39:30.675
It'll pass 14, zero and one absent.

01:39:32.417 --> 01:39:32.818
Excellent.

01:39:33.519 --> 01:39:33.919
All right.

01:39:35.975 --> 01:39:38.358
Moving on, it will be our chair's report.

01:39:38.778 --> 01:39:44.164
Due to the late hour, I will be quoting my principal and saying, I am giving you all the gift of time.

01:39:44.724 --> 01:39:53.374
And all I can say with my chair's report is we will have a border treat on June 7th talking about our 2026 priorities for the agency.

01:39:53.974 --> 01:39:56.477
Again, directors, hopefully you all can make that.

01:39:56.517 --> 01:40:01.142
It'll be a very healthy discussion, a very hearty discussion, I guarantee.

01:40:01.602 --> 01:40:04.085
But please make sure you have that marked down on your calendars.

01:40:04.586 --> 01:40:04.986
Thank you.

01:40:08.662 --> 01:40:11.065
Did you want to remind everybody about the survey we sent you?

01:40:11.085 --> 01:40:11.526
Of course.

01:40:11.666 --> 01:40:12.067
Thank you.

01:40:12.467 --> 01:40:19.397
And of course, directors, you'll see in my weekly update, there was a survey that might have been passed too.

01:40:19.878 --> 01:40:22.382
And if you've not filled out that survey, please do so.

01:40:22.862 --> 01:40:26.107
Thank you for the directors who did fill it in.

01:40:26.307 --> 01:40:27.529
So that's OK.

01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:34.299
If we could get that in by Monday morning, that would be excellent.

01:40:34.359 --> 01:40:36.141
I'll include that in my weekly update, though.

01:40:36.321 --> 01:40:36.762
Thank you.

01:40:37.973 --> 01:40:40.757
I'll give it now over to you, GMCO Johnson.

01:40:42.379 --> 01:40:56.239
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and by to recognize the lateness of the hour, I just have a couple of elements that I'll share with you that are in alignment with our activities and strategic endeavor since our last board meeting on Tuesday, April 29th.

01:40:58.142 --> 01:41:06.934
One notable aspect is the legislative conference held by the American Public Transportation Association from May 18th through the 20th.

01:41:07.302 --> 01:41:19.922
In Washington DC, just for everyone's edification, this annual conference is an opportunity for public transportation industry professionals across the nation to visit Washington DC and connect with policymakers, implementers, and their staffs.

01:41:20.583 --> 01:41:30.880
The conference helps educate and inform active members on important federal legislation and policy initiatives and affords an unparalleled opportunity to shape the industry's positions in federal advocacy agenda.

01:41:31.349 --> 01:41:44.823
I along with directors of Keith Chandler and Guchin Ritter and government relations officer Michael Davies attended conference sessions and meetings with members of Colorado's congressional delegation and their staffs while chairing an app to committee meeting on Sunday May 8th.

01:41:44.883 --> 01:41:57.897
I personally engage with Tariq Bakari who is the acting administrator of the federal transit administration who shared his views and inputs as it relates to public transit as well as the importance of federal and local partnerships.

01:41:58.332 --> 01:42:05.619
Just yesterday, Tuesday, May 27th, I along with members of my team met with individuals representing the Alliance to Transform Transportation.

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:11.765
As you may be aware, it's a coalition of groups on transit related matters in Colorado.

01:42:12.406 --> 01:42:27.681
Alliance representatives in attendance included Executive Director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Danny Katz, or Co-Purg, as we refer to it, Jill Lockenture, Executive Director of the Denver Streets Partnership, Portia Prescott, President of the Rocky Mountain NAACP,

01:42:28.049 --> 01:42:35.815
uh, branch, uh, the state conference representing Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming, Dennis Hawkins representing the amalgamated transit union, 10, zero, one.

01:42:36.233 --> 01:42:45.007
Matt Fromer representing Transportation and Land Use, well, he is the Transportation and Land Use Policy Manager from the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project.

01:42:45.027 --> 01:42:49.434
The meeting really was focused on Alliance's vision for transit in the Denver region.

01:42:50.235 --> 01:42:58.107
As you know, they have been very vocal in which they're seeking to increase funding for transit in the Denver region by $420 million per year.

01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:04.136
to bolster the frequency and availability of transit services in the metro area.

01:43:06.159 --> 01:43:12.706
From RTD's perspective, questions were posed relative to how that $420 million figure was derived.

01:43:13.106 --> 01:43:24.499
And they explained how that came about with the work they had done with a third party entity, very bare bones relative to providing some information

01:43:24.884 --> 01:43:40.817
And then we talked about the agency's focus, which all of you are very well aware that we are laser focused on asset renewal, state of good repair, and rightsizing transit service and alignment with RTD's branded comprehensive operational analysis being the system optimization plan.

01:43:41.675 --> 01:43:55.614
Related to personal security, as was recently reported, RTD experienced a 60% reduction in security-related calls for service as well as a three-year decrease in reports of criminal activities between 2022 and 2025 at Denver Union Station.

01:43:55.674 --> 01:44:10.213
The decrease is representative of concerted efforts to restore and maintain a welcoming transit environment within the critical multi-modal transit hub and following a collaborative and multifaceted strategy aimed at enhancing

01:44:10.582 --> 01:44:15.607
personal safety and security through crime prevention, through environmental design methodologies.

01:44:15.968 --> 01:44:21.954
This effort would have not have been a success without the commitment of numerous agency employees as well as support from the city and county of Denver.

01:44:23.315 --> 01:44:32.165
It's police department, the downtown Denver partnerships, SAGE, hospitality, the lower Denver neighborhood association, as well as several local businesses and downtown Denver residents.

01:44:32.705 --> 01:44:38.952
Fair enforcement has also increased in recent months, which is the result of RTDs growing ranks of sworn police officers

01:44:39.286 --> 01:44:53.924
haven't been trained to perform this function alongside the contracted team that we have in security with Allied Universal personnel who had primarily been responsible for this responsibility.

01:44:54.465 --> 01:45:02.475
I look forward to sharing additional details regarding the impacts of these efforts during the June Performance Committee, which you heard Committee Chair Guzman reference.

01:45:02.759 --> 01:45:09.229
When I along with staff will present data related to annual customer community and employee surveys that have recently concluded.

01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:30.083
On a related note, the agency has proactively increased its transit police officer presence at Denver Union Station and across the agency's downtown Denver sector to support the personal safety and security of customers and visitors attending major events and activity, notably as we know, while we're no longer in the hockey playoffs and NBA, but

01:45:30.552 --> 01:45:34.737
people had a welcoming experience in and around our facilities.

01:45:35.157 --> 01:45:46.410
And RTDPD had increased patrols at Denver Union Station and bus stops and rail stations, the high, before the high profile events, which included the playoff games I just referenced.

01:45:46.771 --> 01:45:51.396
And this coincides with increasing Denver police patrols throughout the downtown area.

01:45:52.037 --> 01:45:58.905
And RTDPD and DPD are working closely to collaborate to support enhanced safety for the traveling public.

01:46:01.045 --> 01:46:13.720
And moreover, data and metrics related to personal safety and security are now conveniently located on the recently created security related metrics page, and we've actually showcased that on other social media channels as well.

01:46:14.921 --> 01:46:27.576
As it relates to our customer excellence in relation to the strategic priorities of customer excellence and employee ownership, I shared yesterday with the board the last of the 31 light rail speed restrictions put into place last year on the DH

01:46:28.079 --> 01:46:30.802
and E&R lines was lifted as of yesterday morning.

01:46:31.843 --> 01:46:35.966
I want to give a special shout out to our maintenance of way teams that have done Yeoman's work.

01:46:36.407 --> 01:46:46.116
The final speed restriction, which was approximately 400 feet in southbound segment north of Southmore Station, was removed after crews completed those repairs.

01:46:48.798 --> 01:46:57.867
Keeping in mind those rigorous restrictions were put into place due to the fact that we enhanced our inspections of track

01:46:58.285 --> 01:47:03.750
back in May 2024 as an enhanced focus on maintaining the agency's assets in a state of good repair.

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:08.034
At the time, you know, crews found several minor issues and track imperfections.

01:47:08.475 --> 01:47:20.846
So as I said before, I thank and congratulate all the agency employees who work tirelessly over the course of these 11 months.

01:47:21.147 --> 01:47:24.850
And like I said, a special shout out to MOW.

01:47:26.534 --> 01:47:41.038
I would be remiss if I didn't state that while this is a cost to celebrate, I shared previously, as we look at our infrastructure and it continues to age, this will be par for the course, but since we're ahead of where we were before, we will see less of an impact, I'm certain.

01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:48.772
And last, but certainly not least, I'm pleased to welcome RTD's new Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who's in the audience.

01:47:48.912 --> 01:47:49.673
She's giving a wave.

01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:51.853
who began her tenure on May 12th.

01:47:52.173 --> 01:47:57.220
And this is her in her first in-person board meeting while we introduced her at the Finance and Planning Committee.

01:47:58.061 --> 01:48:00.524
You guys are real people, not figments of our imagination.

01:48:00.545 --> 01:48:02.267
So I wanted to ensure I did that here.

01:48:02.327 --> 01:48:07.794
So with that, I will yield the floor so we can move on to the rest of the matters that we have before.

01:48:07.915 --> 01:48:09.417
So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.923
Thank you, GMCO Johnson.

01:48:14.824 --> 01:48:17.668
Any comments or questions for GMCO Johnson?

01:48:20.855 --> 01:48:21.255
Yeah.

01:48:26.261 --> 01:48:26.902
Very exciting.

01:48:27.242 --> 01:48:28.804
And Kelly, welcome to the team.

01:48:29.324 --> 01:48:29.665
Thank you.

01:48:32.488 --> 01:48:32.888
All right.

01:48:33.409 --> 01:48:34.130
Moving on.

01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:37.193
Uh, they, we're going to move on to unanimous consent.

01:48:37.614 --> 01:48:47.925
Uh, there are three items on the unanimous consent agenda listed under section 16 actions A through C. Those items are the security operations budget transfer.

01:48:48.125 --> 01:48:55.536
the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, and the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension for one year.

01:48:55.556 --> 01:49:09.657
I do understand that Director Banker would like to offer some amendments to Item B, the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, and such I will remove that to a recommended action, excuse me.

01:49:09.677 --> 01:49:12.040
If anyone else has a change to

01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:24.496
discussion on or questions about any of the remaining unanimous consent items, please feel free to advise the chair at this time, and I'll of course be happy to pull the item from unanimous consent for consideration under recommended action.

01:49:25.597 --> 01:49:26.338
Director Nicholson.

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:31.365
The Allied Universal Security Contract, please pull that.

01:49:31.705 --> 01:49:31.945
Okay.

01:49:32.526 --> 01:49:38.233
So item B will be removed and placed into recommended action.

01:49:39.315 --> 01:49:41.217
Excuse me, former item C,

01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:46.007
as I look in real time here, the Allied Universal Security.

01:49:47.289 --> 01:49:49.472
Are we okay with security operations, budget transfer?

01:49:53.919 --> 01:49:58.365
I would move to approve the remainder of the unanimous consent agenda.

01:49:58.726 --> 01:49:59.166
Second.

01:49:59.667 --> 01:50:02.511
Okay, I have Whitmore and then Ruchess the second.

01:50:05.936 --> 01:50:07.879
Okay, so,

01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:23.916
This is item A for the board of directors to approve a budget transfer of 3,845,437 dollars and 10 cents between operating expenses lines for transit security services.

01:50:26.481 --> 01:50:29.025
Is there any no votes on that?

01:50:31.590 --> 01:50:31.690
Okay.

01:50:33.239 --> 01:50:35.803
Seeing none, that item will pass 14-0-1.

01:50:36.564 --> 01:50:42.452
All right, now we're moving on to our recommended action items.

01:50:43.214 --> 01:50:49.303
And we're gonna have first on our list, the Allied Universal Security Surface Contract Extension for one year.

01:50:50.845 --> 01:50:52.127
Is there a motion?

01:50:53.148 --> 01:50:53.949
So moved.

01:50:53.969 --> 01:50:54.530
Okay, Nicholson.

01:50:56.112 --> 01:50:56.473
In a second?

01:50:57.515 --> 01:50:57.955
And Risha.

01:50:59.658 --> 01:51:00.819
All right, any discussion?

01:51:02.001 --> 01:51:02.622
Director Nicholson.

01:51:03.192 --> 01:51:07.458
Yeah, so I just have a quick question about this one that came from a constituent.

01:51:08.399 --> 01:51:15.610
How many people do we have working on our security side from Allied?

01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:20.737
And how many do we have from RTDPD right now?

01:51:21.558 --> 01:51:21.839
Thank you.

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:23.221
Ms.

01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:23.561
Johnson?

01:51:24.282 --> 01:51:27.627
Yes, I will yield the floor to Chief Martingano who can address that question.

01:51:27.687 --> 01:51:28.027
Thank you.

01:51:30.591 --> 01:51:31.292
Chief Martingano?

01:51:32.386 --> 01:51:36.151
I am trying to figure out whether we can turn the chat for me.

01:51:36.171 --> 01:51:36.531
Yes.

01:51:36.551 --> 01:51:36.771
Yeah.

01:51:36.791 --> 01:51:37.032
So.

01:51:38.273 --> 01:51:42.038
Technically, in regards to how many ally personnel, it's an hourly contract.

01:51:42.378 --> 01:51:45.362
So you'd have to take the amount of the hours and obviously divided by 40.

01:51:45.402 --> 01:51:49.687
It roughly equates to the recommended action for next year.

01:51:49.707 --> 01:51:51.649
I think it's about 9100 hours.

01:51:51.689 --> 01:51:54.833
So it roughly equates about 180 security officers.

01:51:54.813 --> 01:52:00.560
Right now we currently have 87 on our staff in regards to post certified police officers.

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:07.948
We have a couple in training and one in the academy who should be probably about 90 by the end of next month.

01:52:08.308 --> 01:52:08.629
Thank you.

01:52:11.592 --> 01:52:13.034
This is for GMCO Johnson.

01:52:13.875 --> 01:52:16.618
What are there any

01:52:18.083 --> 01:52:22.669
plans in place or is and please feel free to not answer this as we can't.

01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:29.917
But I know there's been a drawdown over the last few years in our reliance on Allied security.

01:52:29.958 --> 01:52:45.897
Is there anything in this contract or in your planning around this contract or anything that can give us guidance on whether we expect that to continue after authorizing this or are we expecting to stay at

01:52:45.877 --> 01:52:51.671
you know, 90, 90, something hundred or 180 people over the next few years.

01:52:53.134 --> 01:52:53.334
Yes.

01:52:53.355 --> 01:52:54.658
Thank you very much for the question.

01:52:54.778 --> 01:52:58.807
As chief indicated, this is a contract extension and there's hours that are specified.

01:52:58.928 --> 01:53:04.240
Hence, in reference to the dollar amount that we have here, I would have to come back to the board

01:53:04.675 --> 01:53:10.481
as it relates to any type of authorization as we're doing now currently with this contract extension, if that were to be modified.

01:53:10.721 --> 01:53:28.020
So on this point in time, it would stay the same unless there's some extenuating circumstances whereby we go out for a solicitation and we're not able to ensure that we're meeting the timeline before, since that's why we're here now with the contract extension quite naturally in doing so.

01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:31.864
We have to ensure that we have the appropriate staffing levels.

01:53:32.266 --> 01:53:37.412
Um, so I'm talking around and around in circles right now, but the answer would be no at this point in time.

01:53:39.014 --> 01:53:39.395
Secretary.

01:53:41.477 --> 01:53:41.778
Perfect.

01:53:42.398 --> 01:53:43.940
Uh, uh, second vice chair, what more?

01:53:45.021 --> 01:53:51.369
So, um, chief, um, jog my memory on our goal for the end of the year for sworn officers.

01:53:51.449 --> 01:53:52.591
It's not 90, right?

01:53:52.671 --> 01:53:54.153
It's continuing to grow.

01:53:54.713 --> 01:53:55.354
Chief.

01:53:55.452 --> 01:53:57.414
Yeah, so we are budgeted for 150.

01:53:57.874 --> 01:54:00.516
We are still in the process of growing to those numbers.

01:54:01.277 --> 01:54:08.703
Um, you know, so obviously with applications, background checks, everything else, um, we're heading positively to that.

01:54:08.743 --> 01:54:10.725
We're putting any more in the academy here in June.

01:54:10.765 --> 01:54:13.247
Um, we'll continue to get lateral transfers.

01:54:13.747 --> 01:54:17.210
I mean, sorry, a lot of applications from other agencies, officers as experience.

01:54:17.671 --> 01:54:20.573
So we're hoping to hit that 150 gold by the end of year.

01:54:20.593 --> 01:54:21.074
All right.

01:54:21.094 --> 01:54:21.814
Thank you very much.

01:54:21.834 --> 01:54:24.296
I did have the right memory up here.

01:54:24.336 --> 01:54:25.257
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

01:54:25.338 --> 01:54:26.860
Absolutely.

01:54:27.821 --> 01:54:30.203
Well, any further questions or discussions on this?

01:54:31.144 --> 01:54:31.704
Yeah, Dr. Risha.

01:54:33.546 --> 01:54:33.887
Thank you, sir.

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:55.108
So I just wanted to note, in the past upon request, the agency has provided a breakdown of how many, just like our security personnel, from, you know, RGD to contracted and even breakdown in terms of with our contracted Allied Force, like,

01:54:56.236 --> 01:55:01.842
the, you know, ones that are authorized to have firearms versus not and our mental health staff and stuff.

01:55:01.862 --> 01:55:08.129
So that's something that I think, uh, the agents, I'm sure the agents would be happy to provide like that breakdown chart.

01:55:08.209 --> 01:55:10.071
I think it's been a little over a year since we've had one.

01:55:10.572 --> 01:55:20.262
So I just wanted to offer that, um, to those who are interested in, and, um, just to piggyback on, uh, Secretary Nicholson's, uh, comments.

01:55:20.282 --> 01:55:21.183
Thank you.

01:55:21.203 --> 01:55:21.844
Thank you, director.

01:55:24.166 --> 01:55:24.267
Okay.

01:55:24.287 --> 01:55:25.568
Any further comments or questions?

01:55:27.168 --> 01:55:27.969
Okay, seeing none.

01:55:28.089 --> 01:55:30.012
So I did have, thank you, Chief.

01:55:30.813 --> 01:55:33.917
I did have Nicholson as the mover and Roush as the second.

01:55:34.418 --> 01:55:36.441
Are there any no votes on this item?

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:44.572
Okay, seeing none, the item will pass 14-0-1 absent.

01:55:45.433 --> 01:55:49.699
We are hitting our two hour mark, so we are gonna take a break for our cart employee.

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.125
Let's shoot to be back here at nine o'clock.

01:55:54.145 --> 01:55:54.846
Would that be enough time?

01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:56.600
Nope.

01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:57.201
Okay.

01:55:57.221 --> 01:55:57.421
Okay.

01:55:57.441 --> 01:55:58.442
Let's do 905 then.

01:55:59.002 --> 01:55:59.543
Thank you.

01:55:59.563 --> 01:56:00.504
Thank you.

01:56:00.524 --> 01:56:25.525
We'll back at 905.

01:56:25.792 --> 01:56:53.246
We've got it.

01:56:53.266 --> 01:56:53.527
We've got it.

01:56:53.547 --> 01:56:53.807
We've got it.

01:56:55.694 --> 01:56:55.934
No.

01:56:58.697 --> 01:57:01.459
No.

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:07.085
No.

01:57:18.535 --> 01:57:25.482
No.

01:57:26.845 --> 01:57:48.280
Yeah.

01:58:01.675 --> 01:58:03.296
Yeah.

01:58:03.917 --> 01:58:05.158
Yeah.

01:58:05.779 --> 01:58:14.767
Yeah.

01:58:19.851 --> 01:58:29.320
Yeah.

01:58:43.222 --> 01:58:48.237
You know what it is.

01:59:30.539 --> 01:59:31.380
Yeah.

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:32.582
Yeah.

01:59:32.682 --> 01:59:33.543
Yeah.

01:59:34.184 --> 01:59:38.891
Yeah.

01:59:43.057 --> 01:59:58.639
Yeah.

02:00:01.775 --> 02:00:29.908
Yeah, we had a tower backed up on Friday night.

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:54.715
And, uh, Senator, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're,

02:01:09.983 --> 02:01:14.009
Thank you.

02:01:17.795 --> 02:01:38.286
Thank you.

02:01:38.722 --> 02:01:56.764
two more you do it

02:02:54.473 --> 02:03:00.080
I'm sorry.

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:03.043
I'm sorry.

02:03:04.405 --> 02:03:23.687
I'm sorry.

02:04:28.855 --> 02:04:30.917
Okay.

02:04:31.538 --> 02:04:52.500
Yeah.

02:05:05.356 --> 02:05:23.331
Okay.

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:05.727
Yeah, we're gonna get started.

02:06:06.028 --> 02:06:09.045
Have you seen Jack?

02:06:44.665 --> 02:07:10.640
All right, folks, we're at 906.

02:07:11.782 --> 02:07:12.883
We're gonna get started.

02:07:17.285 --> 02:07:18.487
Director Bouquet, how do you vote?

02:07:18.868 --> 02:07:19.389
I mean, yes.

02:07:23.117 --> 02:07:38.668
We have a quorum of me and Director Pakulari and Director Nicholson and Director Harwick.

02:07:44.858 --> 02:07:45.459
All right.

02:07:45.479 --> 02:07:46.940
Thank you, everyone, for your patience.

02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:50.664
We are now moving on to our next recommended action for tonight.

02:07:51.905 --> 02:08:04.498
And that is going to be the recommended action of the 2025-2028 Title VI program update to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

02:08:05.779 --> 02:08:06.540
Do we have a motion?

02:08:07.601 --> 02:08:08.662
So moved.

02:08:08.682 --> 02:08:09.763
I have Catlin as the mover.

02:08:10.764 --> 02:08:11.445
Second, Guzman.

02:08:11.785 --> 02:08:13.347
Guzman is the second.

02:08:14.795 --> 02:08:19.224
I do understand that Director Banker has two amendments she would like to offer on this item.

02:08:19.584 --> 02:08:22.149
Director Banker will take your amendments one at a time.

02:08:23.672 --> 02:08:25.616
What is your first amendment, Director Banker?

02:08:26.177 --> 02:08:26.999
Thank you very much.

02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:34.153
And I'm glad everybody is now, you know, second wind and we're ready to go on to our

02:08:35.095 --> 02:08:37.259
I don't know, six or seventh hour of meeting.

02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:41.586
Actually, I will tell you I have three.

02:08:41.626 --> 02:08:42.888
We'll see how things go.

02:08:42.908 --> 02:08:43.990
They're short.

02:08:44.992 --> 02:08:47.516
The first one, well, let me give you a little bit of background.

02:08:47.616 --> 02:08:47.877
Okay.

02:08:48.478 --> 02:08:53.526
So the background is I met with my four cities back in February and March.

02:08:53.506 --> 02:08:58.052
And of course, you meet with them and you say hi and you say, okay, what are your needs?

02:08:58.112 --> 02:08:58.954
What are your wants?

02:08:59.995 --> 02:09:08.447
I met with all of them and they all gave me a list of basically trying to restore service that was removed during the pandemic.

02:09:09.828 --> 02:09:20.403
And so, of course, as my job as director, I'm trying to work with our staff to try to get that service restored.

02:09:21.224 --> 02:09:21.825
And so,

02:09:23.577 --> 02:09:47.188
I, uh, one of my questions or issues is I am guessing that when the RTD board had to make the hard decisions of how to cut service almost in half because of this highly unusual pandemic, perhaps some of these cuts were not done equally across all 15 districts.

02:09:47.438 --> 02:09:52.623
Director Banker, I'm sorry to interrupt, just so that we keep in order, could we get a second on?

02:09:53.004 --> 02:09:54.685
Could you read the motion and then we get a second?

02:09:54.705 --> 02:10:08.219
Yes, the motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact from 10% to 20% as it relates to major service changes and consistent with the FTA circular 4702.1B.

02:10:09.841 --> 02:10:16.247
And I believe the version that will be voted on is actually the version that

02:10:16.852 --> 02:10:18.674
Mr. Kroll put up for us.

02:10:19.755 --> 02:10:21.997
So that's, that's the language right there.

02:10:22.017 --> 02:10:37.931
The first motion is to move the, move to amend the 2025, 2028 title six program update, such that the threshold for triggering either disproved, burden or disparate in that fine late night, finding arising from a major service change from 10% to 20%.

02:10:39.613 --> 02:10:40.393
Do I have a second?

02:10:40.894 --> 02:10:41.815
Second.

02:10:42.115 --> 02:10:43.416
Paglieri is the second.

02:10:44.397 --> 02:10:44.597
Thank you.

02:10:45.488 --> 02:10:51.986
So just to continue a little bit more background and then we can start, I guess, the debate here.

02:10:52.648 --> 02:11:00.510
I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during the pandemic.

02:11:00.490 --> 02:11:13.204
And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested, and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations come out.

02:11:13.865 --> 02:11:30.143
And so I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic, and perhaps do it a little bit quicker.

02:11:31.439 --> 02:11:35.630
and also try to make it not quite so difficult.

02:11:36.071 --> 02:11:43.410
So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the city and county of Broomfield.

02:11:44.212 --> 02:11:48.503
And their transportation staff went through our

02:11:48.483 --> 02:11:55.313
our items quite closely, and they sent us all a letter with recommended changes.

02:11:56.054 --> 02:12:05.869
So I've gone through with their changes, and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the board, see what your thoughts are.

02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:09.074
Hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see what happens.

02:12:09.514 --> 02:12:15.503
But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that

02:12:15.483 --> 02:12:24.714
the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large transit agencies.

02:12:25.374 --> 02:12:30.841
And so I did send you also a copy of the city and county of Broomfields letter just to refresh your memory.

02:12:31.842 --> 02:12:38.629
And so I would like to put forth that the first amendment would be changing the threshold from 10% to 20%.

02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:40.492
Thank you, Treasurer Baker.

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:43.515
So again, the discussion right now is on the motion

02:12:44.153 --> 02:12:46.477
This first motion, the first amendment.

02:12:46.818 --> 02:12:47.639
Director Catlin.

02:12:51.245 --> 02:12:52.147
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

02:12:52.768 --> 02:12:55.613
I'd like to ask GM CEO Johnson.

02:12:56.374 --> 02:13:07.533
I heard from someone I don't remember now because it's getting late, but someone said that some of those assumptions made by City and County Broomfield were incorrect.

02:13:09.036 --> 02:13:09.476
Ms.

02:13:09.496 --> 02:13:09.857
Johnson.

02:13:10.141 --> 02:13:11.283
Yes, thank you very much.

02:13:11.964 --> 02:13:30.470
Relative to the comments that were made and thank you very much, Director Catlin, as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned being more of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in greater Seattle and then Chicago Transit Authority.

02:13:32.232 --> 02:13:39.102
That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there, this is not correct.

02:13:39.453 --> 02:14:04.026
Relative to where we sit and more specifically I do know our director of civil rights when we were going through this quite naturally in the role that he is in He and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies So that's the communicate that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving this information so Mr. Green if you want to just expound succinctly and briefly

02:14:04.495 --> 02:14:10.082
Yes, thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson, to expand upon the response.

02:14:10.122 --> 02:14:19.594
I just also want to ground us in first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes.

02:14:20.215 --> 02:14:27.364
And in doing that audit, we looked at 22 rather 23 different organizations, which includes the four.

02:14:27.344 --> 02:14:31.530
Marta, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority.

02:14:31.570 --> 02:14:43.285
And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right?

02:14:43.486 --> 02:14:45.408
And ours is stacked in the middle.

02:14:45.468 --> 02:14:47.391
So I want to give you some numbers here.

02:14:48.132 --> 02:14:50.635
So for the four that I just mentioned,

02:14:51.762 --> 02:14:53.103
Marta has 10%.

02:14:53.244 --> 02:14:55.166
Elemento has 5%.

02:14:55.946 --> 02:14:57.208
King County has 10%.

02:14:57.448 --> 02:15:00.431
CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%.

02:15:01.472 --> 02:15:10.482
And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, six out of that 23 have 5% or less.

02:15:11.143 --> 02:15:11.964
Two have 8%.

02:15:13.045 --> 02:15:18.090
Six, which includes us or seven, including us, is at 10%.

02:15:18.458 --> 02:15:21.322
three at 15% and then three at 20%.

02:15:21.983 --> 02:15:40.751
And in my over eight years of doing this work, and I'll just say that when you are setting your policy, right, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve, right, specifically with Title VI.

02:15:41.312 --> 02:15:46.980
Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service.

02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:54.997
There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth.

02:15:55.497 --> 02:16:06.969
This is just a mechanism for the agency, such as RTD and the board of directors, so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant.

02:16:06.989 --> 02:16:15.178
So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.

02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.542
I have Director Ruchin next.

02:16:24.407 --> 02:16:29.091
I did have a question, but I also at Treasurer Banker had her hand up and it was her motion.

02:16:29.171 --> 02:16:31.453
So I'm happy to wait if that was in response.

02:16:32.234 --> 02:16:32.794
Treasurer Banker?

02:16:35.277 --> 02:16:40.081
I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic.

02:16:41.062 --> 02:16:44.305
So how can we restore

02:16:45.584 --> 02:16:50.212
let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several years ago.

02:16:50.693 --> 02:16:58.506
How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had that service?

02:16:59.368 --> 02:17:02.513
And so now we're being told

02:17:02.493 --> 02:17:11.625
that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to have it.

02:17:12.786 --> 02:17:19.915
And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to pre-pandemic levels?

02:17:21.237 --> 02:17:21.417
Ms.

02:17:21.437 --> 02:17:21.818
Johnson.

02:17:22.118 --> 02:17:23.740
Yes, thank you very much, Director Banker.

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.362
That question is better suited for me.

02:17:26.164 --> 02:17:29.648
Relative to the service delivery framework that we have,

02:17:29.932 --> 02:17:48.645
While Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy service is based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours, but more specifically at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP.

02:17:49.306 --> 02:17:55.517
When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were.

02:17:56.172 --> 02:17:58.636
85% of what service levels were in 2019.

02:17:59.397 --> 02:18:08.552
We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward.

02:18:09.634 --> 02:18:14.822
What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious

02:18:15.224 --> 02:18:19.651
and how we're applying service because we do want to ensure there's equity.

02:18:19.671 --> 02:18:26.200
I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well.

02:18:26.641 --> 02:18:37.317
As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change.

02:18:37.499 --> 02:18:47.775
That is up to the board quite naturally, but I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service keeping in mind that all transit agencies across the U.S.

02:18:48.055 --> 02:19:00.655
were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power.

02:19:00.972 --> 02:19:06.360
Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio.

02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:16.456
What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio.

02:19:16.776 --> 02:19:24.108
We've deviated from that and have a waiver and we're right sizing the fleet as we move forward.

02:19:24.148 --> 02:19:26.271
So while you're bringing up these points,

02:19:26.555 --> 02:19:31.822
As you indicated, we are in uncharted territory or were, and we're coming back from that.

02:19:32.783 --> 02:19:45.038
We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area from an origin and destination vantage point just by virtue of how our service area is going forward.

02:19:45.519 --> 02:19:51.126
So I'm not providing this to say I don't understand what you're trying to do.

02:19:51.146 --> 02:19:54.570
And as I share it with you, I do clearly, and we want to work

02:19:54.550 --> 02:20:03.282
within the framework that we have, but a whole cell of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible.

02:20:03.362 --> 02:20:13.395
And I say it from the vantage point of, we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour, but that was out on the street.

02:20:13.716 --> 02:20:17.160
Does that really yield the return on investment going forward?

02:20:17.281 --> 02:20:20.625
Hence, that's why there were modifications relative to

02:20:21.331 --> 02:20:24.819
reallocation of services going forward.

02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:26.683
Okay, but if I can.

02:20:26.823 --> 02:20:28.788
Treasure, yeah.

02:20:28.868 --> 02:20:32.837
Some of the issues that you just raised are important.

02:20:33.037 --> 02:20:33.659
There's no doubt.

02:20:34.020 --> 02:20:38.269
However, I don't believe it goes to the equity calculation.

02:20:40.735 --> 02:20:40.875
I

02:20:42.914 --> 02:20:58.611
What I think is important to to hear from staff and I know we're going to be talking about this in our retreat, which is I'm looking forward to that is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in three years.

02:20:59.283 --> 02:21:18.848
what barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110 and start quickly, or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher service levels.

02:21:20.810 --> 02:21:20.970
Ms.

02:21:21.010 --> 02:21:21.351
Johnson.

02:21:21.631 --> 02:21:22.032
Thank you.

02:21:22.893 --> 02:21:25.476
There's a couple of external factors that play into that.

02:21:25.844 --> 02:21:32.777
quite naturally when we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate and the lack of people commuting in.

02:21:33.278 --> 02:21:45.160
It's important to keep in mind that there was, I'm forgetting the name, but the city and county of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate and looking at the occupancy levels.

02:21:45.421 --> 02:21:49.388
But more specifically, what's important to note is that

02:21:49.368 --> 02:21:54.578
There hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to this central business district.

02:21:55.780 --> 02:22:06.640
I believe the last time I looked at stats, city and county at Denver was in the bottom three out of out of 50 major cities.

02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:10.347
And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number

02:22:11.913 --> 02:22:16.757
is the third state relative to remote work and then City of Boulder is number one.

02:22:17.178 --> 02:22:24.925
While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic.

02:22:25.285 --> 02:22:34.734
How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before?

02:22:35.394 --> 02:22:39.338
I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward

02:22:39.672 --> 02:23:03.205
relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair and the other aspects that have cost people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery.

02:23:03.726 --> 02:23:06.810
And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power,

02:23:07.111 --> 02:23:31.442
we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available where people whereby were working extra shifts and then we didn't have enough people for daily pullout on those other routes.

02:23:31.862 --> 02:23:35.447
And so I'm providing that context to say

02:23:35.782 --> 02:23:55.765
to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do, but to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of these agencies.

02:23:57.854 --> 02:23:58.255
Thanks.

02:23:58.315 --> 02:24:01.720
So I have a question for her legal.

02:24:03.142 --> 02:24:13.338
So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I want to be careful of my words.

02:24:15.141 --> 02:24:26.038
Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public comment process or

02:24:26.592 --> 02:24:33.962
Is that something that we, I guess, I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area, and I wanted to get a bit of feedback on that.

02:24:34.422 --> 02:24:39.029
Now, to disparage the motion, I just also want to understand the potential legal implications.

02:24:44.175 --> 02:24:49.743
I will address that question, and then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound.

02:24:49.823 --> 02:24:52.887
I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement,

02:24:53.457 --> 02:25:17.237
and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference of public perception.

02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:23.636
There is leeway relative to the circular in light of what can be done.

02:25:23.696 --> 02:25:36.789
We are sitting here on May 28th, recognizing that we have a new administration and that we do need to have a Title VI program that's submitted and we have been engaged on this topic since January.

02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:39.872
That's not to negate any amendments or anything like that.

02:25:39.953 --> 02:25:42.415
I am just trying to answer the question.

02:25:42.665 --> 02:25:49.813
but more specifically, Mr. Green, since you are very well-versed in 4702.1B, I would yield the floor to you.

02:25:49.853 --> 02:25:53.918
And that's the citation for the FTA circular that we're talking about.

02:25:54.359 --> 02:25:56.721
Yes, thank you so much, GM, CEO, Johnson.

02:25:57.522 --> 02:26:00.526
You, ooh.

02:26:02.388 --> 02:26:03.790
Apology, the apology.

02:26:03.810 --> 02:26:04.771
That's sort of microphone.

02:26:05.071 --> 02:26:06.172
Yes, apologies.

02:26:06.232 --> 02:26:10.157
But to piggyback off what GM CEO Johnson has noted,

02:26:11.167 --> 02:26:18.226
That is, I would couch that as the bigger risk is when we think about establishing policy, right?

02:26:18.767 --> 02:26:22.898
As it relates to 4702.1B, the FTA Title VI circular.

02:26:23.283 --> 02:26:32.698
it does call upon the agency to do a lot of outreach and public involvement to ensure that we are collecting that feedback to inform decisions.

02:26:33.259 --> 02:26:46.641
So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as the policy.

02:26:47.347 --> 02:26:51.472
So, but with respect to the circular, we can, i.e.

02:26:51.792 --> 02:26:55.717
the board of directors could adopt a different threshold.

02:26:55.757 --> 02:27:08.852
So for example, the one that director banker has put forth, although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update.

02:27:09.613 --> 02:27:16.881
There is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the board is ultimately approving the policy.

02:27:18.768 --> 02:27:19.168
Thank you.

02:27:20.009 --> 02:27:23.933
Director Gysinger and then Director Larson.

02:27:27.536 --> 02:27:29.057
Director Larson and then Harwick.

02:27:31.219 --> 02:27:31.660
Thank you.

02:27:33.221 --> 02:27:48.235
I guess my question is I looked through a lot of the title six updates that were for service changes, this title six analysis, the analyses that were in the

02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:49.441
the board packet.

02:27:50.022 --> 02:28:03.959
And it seemed like most of the time we, you know, sometimes there was a little bit of disparate impact on one route or the other, but mostly it sort of ended up that in the aggregate, there wasn't really much.

02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:10.947
And there were legitimate justifications for what there was on an individual basis.

02:28:11.728 --> 02:28:15.893
I guess my, you know, my basic question is with

02:28:16.278 --> 02:28:24.328
with regard to this update and the changes that we're proposing, are we just, I mean, is there really a problem here?

02:28:24.368 --> 02:28:26.531
Are we just making this harder for ourselves?

02:28:26.591 --> 02:28:37.725
Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact one place or the other.

02:28:37.785 --> 02:28:41.569
We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons.

02:28:42.531 --> 02:28:46.015
And on balance, they don't really seem to

02:28:46.619 --> 02:28:59.541
under our current setup, you know, ever, ever sort of look like they were, you know, there were somehow some, you know, bad intent or just inattention to who we're serving.

02:28:59.581 --> 02:29:05.691
It seems like we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have done anyways.

02:29:06.059 --> 02:29:26.827
Why put sort of a greater burden, sort of regulate ourselves more than we have to, and why not just give us the freedom to operate as we would as much as we can, given that we don't, you know, it doesn't necessarily seem like it's been a problem for a long time, at least from what I could see.

02:29:26.848 --> 02:29:35.239
I mean, there weren't that many Title VI complaints that I could, that I, in the information that was provided.

02:29:35.725 --> 02:29:36.087
I don't know.

02:29:37.293 --> 02:29:40.389
My basic question is why would we make things harder for ourselves?

02:29:40.751 --> 02:29:40.993
Thanks.

02:29:42.762 --> 02:29:43.646
Thank you, Ms.

02:29:43.687 --> 02:29:44.149
Johnson.

02:29:45.631 --> 02:29:46.252
Thank you very much.

02:29:46.292 --> 02:30:03.131
The one thing I would share Director Larson, as we look at the modification that's been put forward for your consideration, like a 36 month period, as we're adding back service, there could be unforeseen consequences as we do them in a segmented fashion.

02:30:03.471 --> 02:30:13.022
And so that's one element as a whole, because if we're making modifications going forward, there could be an adverse impact.

02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:15.743
And so that's what I would showcase there.

02:30:16.524 --> 02:30:28.561
Keeping in mind to the point that you raised, when we talk about the aspect of DIDB, it's what can we do as an agency to help mitigate that to your point going forward.

02:30:28.802 --> 02:30:41.119
But it's just to ensure that we have a program whereby we are not causing undue harm to certain population segments.

02:30:43.158 --> 02:31:00.277
But it just seems like when I was reading the documents that there, there's always a legitimate justification for, for everything we want to do or we, you know, it's always, there's always this, we'll have a disparate impact, but we have a legitimate justification for, for doing this or we're just going to do it.

02:31:00.797 --> 02:31:09.807
I mean, how many times, how many times in the last however many years has it been that we did this analysis, we looked at all the service changes we wanted to do,

02:31:10.158 --> 02:31:14.624
And we were like, okay, no, we're not going to do this list of service changes.

02:31:14.664 --> 02:31:20.913
We're going to, you know, cross out these ones because the aggregate impact is too much.

02:31:21.493 --> 02:31:22.655
I mean, is it, is it caught?

02:31:22.695 --> 02:31:30.586
Is that, it just didn't, from what I read in the packet, I didn't, I don't know if I caught everything, but it didn't seem like there were a lot of those.

02:31:30.846 --> 02:31:39.658
Or is this happening kind of at an earlier stage where when Bob in service says, let's just send a bunch of buses to Cherry Hills Village, somebody says, no, no.

02:31:39.892 --> 02:31:44.197
that's not gonna work out before it even gets to this point.

02:31:45.399 --> 02:31:45.699
You know?

02:31:48.102 --> 02:31:48.582
I'm sorry.

02:31:49.323 --> 02:31:50.345
Thank you for the question.

02:31:50.385 --> 02:31:57.012
It's for me, I've only been here for five years and I came in the height of the pandemic and we've been adding back service and not.

02:31:57.413 --> 02:32:07.485
So that's difficult for me to answer just because we have not been in a situation whereby

02:32:08.191 --> 02:32:09.313
It's been the opposite.

02:32:09.954 --> 02:32:12.237
Carl, do you have anything to add?

02:32:12.838 --> 02:32:13.239
Yeah.

02:32:13.259 --> 02:32:14.761
I would just highlight chair bouquet.

02:32:14.781 --> 02:32:31.988
If I may, since January 2023, there was about 270 service change recommendations that have been implemented and roughly 26, 24, 26 of those 276 were considered major service changes.

02:32:32.508 --> 02:32:39.420
And out of that 26 to director Larson's point, there has been 13 potential disparate impacts.

02:32:40.301 --> 02:32:54.465
And to your point, there was a substantial legitimate justification and going, I wouldn't necessarily couch it as an exercise, but I would say we were the transit equity office within the civil rights division.

02:32:54.732 --> 02:32:59.247
works hand in glove with Jesse Carter and his team service development.

02:33:00.030 --> 02:33:07.695
And as we are having those conversations after the service change recommendation are put forth and we analyze it if there is a potential disparate impact.

02:33:08.063 --> 02:33:13.753
More often than not, to your point, and to my earlier, earlier point, that Title VI is not a stopping mechanism.

02:33:14.294 --> 02:33:25.073
And I wouldn't necessarily state that it's burdensome because it's one of our responsibilities to make sure that we are equitably distributing services across our service area.

02:33:25.694 --> 02:33:33.227
But more often not, there is a legitimate justification to put forth the service recommendation as it is presented to the board.

02:33:35.941 --> 02:33:37.704
Thank you, director.

02:33:39.827 --> 02:33:39.927
Okay.

02:33:39.947 --> 02:33:46.358
Uh, I had director Harwick and just as a reminder, we're currently in discussion regarding this first motion.

02:33:46.438 --> 02:33:50.885
Just want to make sure that, uh, first amendment, excuse me, first amendment.

02:33:50.905 --> 02:33:54.390
So make sure, uh, comments are around that.

02:33:54.430 --> 02:33:55.452
Director Harwick.

02:33:57.187 --> 02:34:06.788
Mine will be comments about this, but also moving forward as well, because I am in support of this, this title six, not, not the amendment, just as just a straight title six.

02:34:07.890 --> 02:34:13.542
Um, you know, I'm, I don't think moving, uh, from, from 10 or from.

02:34:13.522 --> 02:34:18.871
from 10% to 20% is going to increase ridership.

02:34:19.091 --> 02:34:29.289
I think that right now it allows our staff the ability to really center equity and effectively protect our communities.

02:34:29.369 --> 02:34:36.120
And while I get that Broomfield feels like they want more service, I don't think this is going to get it there.

02:34:36.758 --> 02:34:41.756
I think this is the 11th hour and I think that it's really imperative that our staff has worked extremely hard on this.

02:34:41.796 --> 02:34:47.275
They've had to jump through a whole variety of hoops.

02:34:47.947 --> 02:35:13.144
bunch of different board members and I think that we're here, they've done an incredible job and I think that this is, they are the subject matter experts and it's our opportunity here to put our trust in them, our belief in them and I think that we owe them that and we have been talking about this since January so we're well into four months and I think that it is key that we support this

02:35:13.124 --> 02:35:22.058
Title 6 as is and we allow them to move forward and we allow them to start you know handing us off to the feds and we can move forward and That's where I'm at.

02:35:22.178 --> 02:35:22.459
Thank you.

02:35:22.819 --> 02:35:32.955
Thank you director any further conversation on this amendment Secretary Nicholson So this is for our deputy general counsel

02:35:33.222 --> 02:35:45.399
If we were to pass this tonight, what's the legal risk to the agency when it comes to our federal Title VI approval as a result of this change?

02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:57.937
Like, is this gonna have any, would this have any legal repercussions or could we just, do we feel pretty comfortable that we could do this and not have the federal government take issue with it?

02:35:59.319 --> 02:36:00.661
In regards to the amendment secretary?

02:36:01.222 --> 02:36:01.322
Yeah.

02:36:04.745 --> 02:36:05.346
deputy counsel.

02:36:09.252 --> 02:36:09.593
There we go.

02:36:09.613 --> 02:36:10.114
Excuse me.

02:36:10.655 --> 02:36:12.037
Uh, thank you, director Nicholson.

02:36:12.578 --> 02:36:13.860
Um, I, I don't have concerns.

02:36:16.785 --> 02:36:17.185
Secretary.

02:36:19.028 --> 02:36:19.569
That is all.

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:21.773
Uh, yeah, treasure banker.

02:36:23.856 --> 02:36:31.208
Um, it, he, here is where I do not understand in 2019.

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:35.055
We had the service.

02:36:36.359 --> 02:36:40.754
My area, my district as many others have grown.

02:36:40.794 --> 02:36:43.864
There's no

02:36:45.177 --> 02:36:53.109
For example, the town of Erie, just a few years ago was 20,000, now it's 40,000, like two, three years later.

02:36:53.149 --> 02:37:01.202
And when I met with Erie, they said, hey, we're planning going to 80,000 in just the next couple of years.

02:37:01.943 --> 02:37:12.619
I also read in the Denver Post that the town of Erie is the 15th fastest city in the country in terms of population growth.

02:37:13.561 --> 02:37:29.186
So my question is, is if we had the service prior to the pandemic and it was serving all of these communities, why is it so difficult to get that restored?

02:37:33.332 --> 02:37:33.953
Just Johnson.

02:37:37.619 --> 02:37:40.243
So thank you, Director Banker.

02:37:42.518 --> 02:38:02.659
This, what I'm going to say goes back to the previous comments that I had before, recognizing that RTD is a regional service and the way the service was outlined for all intents and purposes was bringing individuals into the central business district.

02:38:05.121 --> 02:38:10.787
That level of ridership isn't there and that's not to negate that there

02:38:11.695 --> 02:38:17.121
is some elements centered on a need to move people to and fro.

02:38:17.161 --> 02:38:20.865
Hence, that's why there was the advent of the partnership program.

02:38:21.225 --> 02:38:30.115
And one of the reasons why Erie basically wanted to join the district because they were looking to put forward an application for the partnership program.

02:38:30.135 --> 02:38:41.027
And I know you're just using that as an example, but just wanted to further iterate that because for all intents and purposes, as we're looking to provide mobility options

02:38:41.834 --> 02:39:06.508
The intent behind the partnership program was more or less like a pilot in the sense that let's see how many people are utilizing this means of connection prior to putting out a 40 foot or a 60 foot Arctic that costs more money per revenue hour and doesn't yield the same return on investment relative to the cost per boarding.

02:39:08.110 --> 02:39:11.014
Does that help or did I complicated more?

02:39:11.855 --> 02:39:14.498
No, okay.

02:39:14.518 --> 02:39:14.838
Thank you.

02:39:15.099 --> 02:39:16.900
Director Guzman and then Director Geysinger.

02:39:17.661 --> 02:39:24.148
So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight, getting back to the motion before us.

02:39:25.089 --> 02:39:37.643
I would like to ask one question, which is the 10 to 20% is still not going to prevent us from adding services.

02:39:38.028 --> 02:40:00.669
It is simply a filter through which to look, if I understand this correctly, that we are not unintentionally harming community with protected status under the Title VI legislation or those that might be disproportionately burdened or impacted by their financial and economic status within the region.

02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:05.554
The only purpose we need to pass this is because it is due

02:40:06.108 --> 02:40:14.018
because it is the law and it is how we ensure that we are able to receive our federal funding, which is approximately 25% of our total budget.

02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:23.650
So I just want to make sure I understand, like what has been presented here does not tell the board, no, we cannot provide transit service.

02:40:24.471 --> 02:40:32.301
It is simply a way to look at it and say, we may have an issue if it reaches a certain threshold that we need to be aware of.

02:40:34.306 --> 02:40:48.383
in order to be able to approve changes in service, fair changes, or other changes that would create a potential burden on specific communities as defined within the Title VI language.

02:40:48.563 --> 02:40:52.889
Is that correct, or am I completely lost in this conversation?

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:55.452
Chair, are we okay for me?

02:40:55.832 --> 02:40:56.653
Absolutely, Mr. Green.

02:40:56.914 --> 02:41:03.722
If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear, and if you have any double back, then I'll respond to it.

02:41:04.208 --> 02:41:30.992
So the current 10%, so if we think about different thresholds for DIDB, and we are in, based off the desk audit, we're in the middle tier of having a threshold that allows us as an agency, which ultimately, each service equity analysis is approved by the board of directors, where it allows us, again, to your point, when we're thinking about BIPOC or Black Indigenous people of color,

02:41:31.310 --> 02:41:35.075
for disparate impact or loan communities, for disproportionate burden.

02:41:35.716 --> 02:41:45.288
It allows us to make a well-informed, eyes-wide open decision of better understanding of who's more likely to receive more of the impact.

02:41:45.308 --> 02:41:53.859
And when we're thinking about service increases, we're thinking about the fair share of benefits, where if there is a service reduction, we're looking at who's more likely to receive more of the burden.

02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:59.747
So to your point, Director Guzman, it allows us to just get a better understanding

02:41:59.997 --> 02:42:03.982
of the level of impact that we can have on a particular community.

02:42:04.423 --> 02:42:07.006
It does not prevent us from moving forward.

02:42:09.089 --> 02:42:09.449
Thank you.

02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:16.799
I would just urge a no vote and let's move on to the policy.

02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:18.181
All right.

02:42:18.982 --> 02:42:23.828
Dr. Geisinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this specific amendment.

02:42:24.061 --> 02:42:25.222
I'll be super quick.

02:42:25.242 --> 02:42:31.470
At that last explanation that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of just giving us a better holistic view.

02:42:31.490 --> 02:42:39.340
But I shared Director Larson's sort of view of are we just making this harder for ourselves, creating more work?

02:42:41.062 --> 02:42:41.863
Is that not right?

02:42:43.445 --> 02:42:43.906
Mr. Green?

02:42:44.386 --> 02:42:46.128
Yeah, that's a great follow up question.

02:42:46.509 --> 02:42:47.470
I would say it

02:42:48.698 --> 02:43:01.937
I wouldn't say it's making it harder, because when we think about what we're ultimately trying to achieve, and a percentage that's mathematically consistent relative to the populations that we serve.

02:43:02.498 --> 02:43:16.579
So in doing this work, given my background, and doing an assessment of whether if we, and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is

02:43:16.829 --> 02:43:27.984
with doing this work or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyses, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything.

02:43:29.226 --> 02:43:39.900
And that's a disservice when we think about our populations within our service area, specifically as we look at our census data where 38.1% is BIPOC, 13.1%.

02:43:40.505 --> 02:43:43.448
or 14.1 rather for low income, right?

02:43:43.568 --> 02:43:47.812
And then if we look at the onboard survey, 56% are considered BIPOC.

02:43:48.813 --> 02:44:09.634
And so I say all that to say, just to wrap it up, is that 10% threshold for DINDB allows us to make an informed decision that is backed by not only our desk audit, but the years of experience and knowing, having a better understanding of ultimately what we're trying to achieve.

02:44:12.179 --> 02:44:12.920
Thank you.

02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:13.260
Thank you.

02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:15.222
All right, let's do a roll call vote.

02:44:15.482 --> 02:44:25.591
As a reminder, it is the First Amendment being introduced, as you all can see on that screen, with Director Banker as the mover and Director Pagulieri as the second.

02:44:25.711 --> 02:44:28.354
Again, we're voting on this First Amendment.

02:44:29.174 --> 02:44:29.775
Treasure Banker.

02:44:30.636 --> 02:44:31.657
Yes.

02:44:31.677 --> 02:44:32.778
Director Music is gone.

02:44:33.558 --> 02:44:34.259
Director Katlin.

02:44:35.841 --> 02:44:36.041
No.

02:44:36.901 --> 02:44:38.103
Director Geisinger.

02:44:40.725 --> 02:44:40.785
No.

02:44:42.183 --> 02:44:42.584
Director.

02:44:42.684 --> 02:44:42.864
No.

02:44:43.024 --> 02:44:43.164
No.

02:44:43.906 --> 02:44:44.947
No.

02:44:44.967 --> 02:44:45.067
No.

02:44:45.087 --> 02:44:45.167
No.

02:44:45.268 --> 02:44:45.448
No.

02:44:45.468 --> 02:44:45.608
No.

02:44:46.009 --> 02:44:46.990
No.

02:44:47.050 --> 02:44:47.331
No.

02:44:47.491 --> 02:44:47.711
No.

02:44:48.492 --> 02:44:48.973
No.

02:44:48.993 --> 02:44:49.093
No.

02:44:49.854 --> 02:44:51.396
No.

02:44:51.457 --> 02:44:52.718
No.

02:44:54.501 --> 02:44:55.462
No.

02:44:58.928 --> 02:45:00.750
No.

02:45:02.292 --> 02:45:05.157
No.

02:45:06.178 --> 02:45:08.341
No.

02:45:08.562 --> 02:45:08.682
No.

02:45:09.223 --> 02:45:09.523
No.

02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:13.323
I'm a yes, but the motion will fail.

02:45:14.807 --> 02:45:17.954
And we have three to 10.

02:45:19.278 --> 02:45:20.801
Okay.

02:45:20.821 --> 02:45:21.322
Moving on.

02:45:21.563 --> 02:45:22.164
Yes, Director.

02:45:22.204 --> 02:45:24.309
I would like to withdraw the next two amendments.

02:45:24.771 --> 02:45:25.472
Next two amendments.

02:45:25.592 --> 02:45:25.833
Yes.

02:45:26.495 --> 02:45:27.457
Okay.

02:45:27.477 --> 02:45:30.043
The next two amendments have been withdrawn.

02:45:31.373 --> 02:45:32.918
Okay, they were never introduced.

02:45:32.938 --> 02:45:39.660
So they're not really with John, but now you would return back to the debate on the main motion, which is to approve the title sex program update.

02:45:40.102 --> 02:45:40.483
Excellent.

02:45:41.025 --> 02:45:42.269
Back to the main motion in hand.

02:45:42.831 --> 02:45:43.493
Director Keith.

02:45:45.008 --> 02:45:52.276
So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on this action.

02:45:52.316 --> 02:45:55.039
There's a few things going on.

02:45:55.099 --> 02:45:58.263
First of all, it should never get to the last minute.

02:45:58.783 --> 02:46:03.929
The board should never be asked to pass things because it's due in two days.

02:46:04.249 --> 02:46:10.476
And I know there's a lot of things that go into the delay, but that's just not the right

02:46:10.912 --> 02:46:16.404
That's not the right urgency to place on the board act.

02:46:17.667 --> 02:46:24.763
Secondly, I don't know very much about this topic and I have sat in on two operations committee meetings.

02:46:26.166 --> 02:46:27.389
I've talked to a bunch of people.

02:46:27.449 --> 02:46:30.135
I've done my own research.

02:46:30.115 --> 02:46:35.443
And I still am looking for a succinct description of the program.

02:46:35.464 --> 02:46:40.992
I would note that there was a wonderful book written by Robert Carrow.

02:46:41.092 --> 02:46:42.214
It's called The Power Broker.

02:46:42.455 --> 02:46:44.718
I'm sure a lot of people in this room know it.

02:46:45.439 --> 02:46:52.090
Talks a lot about bad policy decisions on disadvantaged communities.

02:46:52.070 --> 02:47:00.174
and how those decisions were made and the harmful outcome of those decisions.

02:47:01.619 --> 02:47:06.012
It is 15 pages shorter than our packet tonight.

02:47:06.582 --> 02:47:16.158
He won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1,200 page treatise on impact by public infrastructure.

02:47:16.178 --> 02:47:28.438
I would request that when we're passing along documents as part of a packet, it needs to have a point and it should be summarized from the committee for the rest of the board.

02:47:28.418 --> 02:47:33.225
Simply passing things along for us does not help me understand this better.

02:47:33.265 --> 02:47:54.257
I'm probably a yes vote tonight, but I was I was in no vote until about an hour and a half ago And so I just when you are putting together packets on complex on complex questions for the board Given us reams of paper does not help us get to a better decision.

02:47:54.978 --> 02:47:57.902
So that's something request for the

02:47:58.709 --> 02:48:03.879
two, three-ish committee chairs as you're putting together topics like this.

02:48:04.199 --> 02:48:07.686
And that would be very helpful for me to make better decisions.

02:48:08.267 --> 02:48:08.547
Thanks.

02:48:08.848 --> 02:48:09.769
Thank you, Director O'Keefe.

02:48:10.531 --> 02:48:12.555
Any further comments or questions on the main motion?

02:48:13.597 --> 02:48:14.198
Director Guzman.

02:48:14.518 --> 02:48:18.726
I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously

02:48:19.347 --> 02:48:25.014
submitted a proclamation for RTD on May 19th, 2025.

02:48:25.094 --> 02:48:26.696
It is in the director's emails.

02:48:27.357 --> 02:48:43.937
It was sent over by city council that they wholeheartedly support the 2025, 2028 title six program to include the proposed updates to major service change, disparate impact and fair equity policies, as well as updates to RTD's public participation plan and language access plan, which we are voting on now.

02:48:44.660 --> 02:48:48.904
and that the clerk and recorder of the city and county of Denver did affix the seal making it official.

02:48:50.045 --> 02:48:51.827
Uh, I believe that that is necessary.

02:48:51.847 --> 02:48:52.988
There's a whole proclamation.

02:48:53.289 --> 02:49:04.440
You can read through it, but, uh, former board director, uh, Lewis, sorry, we had two Lewis's and I wanted to make sure I said it right.

02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:10.566
Um, did work with city council member, um, Serena Gutierrez Gonzalez and

02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:15.389
the unanimity of that vote is remarkable from our City Council.

02:49:15.489 --> 02:49:18.917
So they stand behind this as well with us to move this forward.

02:49:18.937 --> 02:49:19.257
Thank you.

02:49:19.919 --> 02:49:20.760
Thank you, Director Ruzbel.

02:49:21.542 --> 02:49:22.244
Director Larson?

02:49:23.647 --> 02:49:25.250
I'm going to be in no vote.

02:49:25.651 --> 02:49:27.154
I think

02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:31.716
I think it's kind of like I said, we're constraining our freedom to operate.

02:49:31.756 --> 02:49:34.781
We're spending a lot of energy and effort to track this.

02:49:35.161 --> 02:49:48.862
And I know the intentions behind that are good, but I think just as a matter of principle, we shouldn't be sort of trying to over, or regulating ourselves more.

02:49:49.282 --> 02:49:54.610
We should be thinking is, there's not really a lot of evidence

02:49:54.590 --> 02:50:06.253
that we have disparately ever had any recent plans to to expand service or or decrease service in a way that that

02:50:06.689 --> 02:50:10.195
causes a disparate impact on these populations.

02:50:10.616 --> 02:50:25.701
And I honestly believe that if we focused 100% just on increasing ridership, which is what I think we should be doing and not trying to expand our sort of purview about when, you know, when maybe we shouldn't increase ridership.

02:50:25.782 --> 02:50:28.967
I don't know if we really, if there's, if it's legitimate, we'll do it anyways.

02:50:29.318 --> 02:50:44.474
I really think if we were focusing strictly on increasing ridership, we would actually, it would all be disparately impacted in favor of all the communities we're worried about just based on the way population is distributed in the area.

02:50:44.514 --> 02:50:54.364
And I would like for us to kind of move towards a paradigm of focusing much, much more on increasing ridership across the board.

02:50:54.817 --> 02:50:59.851
and less on finding possible reasons to not increase ridership.

02:51:01.015 --> 02:51:01.997
So I'll be a no vote.

02:51:02.017 --> 02:51:02.258
Thanks.

02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:03.802
Thank you, direct election.

02:51:03.883 --> 02:51:04.725
Secretary Nicholson.

02:51:06.342 --> 02:51:14.970
So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session and a town hall all on this topic.

02:51:15.310 --> 02:51:26.220
And I should say, expertly facilitated by our co-chairs and by our chair of finance and our staff.

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:32.305
And I feel like I just starting to get a decent understanding of it.

02:51:32.325 --> 02:51:36.349
Like I came into this knowing nothing about this.

02:51:36.329 --> 02:51:44.326
I was an absolute no when we first started and my public remarks made that very clear.

02:51:44.426 --> 02:51:56.312
But I want to commend staff and our board leadership who were willing to indulge because I came to understand it.

02:51:56.697 --> 02:51:57.961
I came to understand what it was for.

02:51:58.221 --> 02:51:59.485
I came to understand how it works.

02:52:00.608 --> 02:52:02.694
And I don't necessarily agree with all of it.

02:52:03.056 --> 02:52:08.732
And I think we could use more data in addition to those data we have now to determine this.

02:52:09.843 --> 02:52:11.826
If we don't pass this, we lose federal funding.

02:52:12.167 --> 02:52:14.310
So there's a good reason to pass it even if you don't like it.

02:52:15.873 --> 02:52:20.640
But on top of that, I just think our staff did their jobs.

02:52:21.121 --> 02:52:26.129
They have demonstrated to me this is the right thing to do despite my skepticism.

02:52:26.370 --> 02:52:28.193
And so I'm definitely voting for it tonight.

02:52:28.814 --> 02:52:29.154
Thank you.

02:52:29.595 --> 02:52:30.957
Any further comments on the main motion?

02:52:32.337 --> 02:52:35.841
Okay, seeing none, we had Catlin as the mover and Guzmán as the second.

02:52:36.362 --> 02:52:40.547
There is indication that there will be no votes, so I will be doing a roll call vote on this.

02:52:41.929 --> 02:52:42.690
Uh, Treasurer Banker.

02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:43.992
Uh, no.

02:52:45.854 --> 02:52:46.535
Director Catlin.

02:52:47.416 --> 02:52:47.636
Yes.

02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:50.820
Director Geisinger.

02:52:51.461 --> 02:52:53.524
Yes.

02:52:53.584 --> 02:52:55.486
Director Guzmán.

02:52:55.687 --> 02:52:55.927
Yes.

02:52:56.247 --> 02:52:56.868
Director Harwick.

02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.689
Yes.

02:52:59.031 --> 02:52:59.692
Director Larson.

02:53:00.293 --> 02:53:00.673
No.

02:53:01.008 --> 02:53:01.869
Secretary Nicholson.

02:53:02.530 --> 02:53:02.831
I'm in.

02:53:04.133 --> 02:53:04.994
First Vice Chair O'Keeffe.

02:53:05.855 --> 02:53:06.096
Yes.

02:53:06.476 --> 02:53:07.277
Dr. Pagulari.

02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:09.120
Yes.

02:53:09.801 --> 02:53:10.422
Dr. Arusha.

02:53:10.743 --> 02:53:12.485
Yep.

02:53:12.565 --> 02:53:13.507
Second Vice Chair Whitmore.

02:53:13.907 --> 02:53:14.168
Yes.

02:53:14.909 --> 02:53:15.790
I'm also yes.

02:53:16.211 --> 02:53:22.320
So the motion, the main motion will pass 11, 2, and 2 absent.

02:53:23.762 --> 02:53:25.405
Yes, that math adds up.

02:53:26.146 --> 02:53:26.426
Okay.

02:53:26.947 --> 02:53:30.272
Moving on, we are going to be moving to our next recommended action.

02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:37.610
which is the budget transfer articulated buses supporting Colfax, bus rapid transit or BRT service.

02:53:37.690 --> 02:53:38.631
Do I have a mover?

02:53:39.553 --> 02:53:40.374
So moved Guzman.

02:53:40.534 --> 02:53:41.576
I have Guzman as the mover.

02:53:41.616 --> 02:53:42.297
Do I have a second?

02:53:42.437 --> 02:53:42.697
Second.

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:44.580
Sir.

02:53:44.941 --> 02:53:45.642
Yeah.

02:53:45.662 --> 02:53:45.922
Oh, wait.

02:53:46.343 --> 02:53:46.964
Well, I could be wrong.

02:53:46.984 --> 02:53:47.324
I'm sorry.

02:53:48.105 --> 02:53:49.067
I forgot we started late.

02:53:49.347 --> 02:53:50.429
I thought we had our four hour mark.

02:53:50.909 --> 02:53:54.455
Please ignore me.

02:53:54.475 --> 02:53:54.575
Oh.

02:53:54.835 --> 02:53:54.955
Sorry.

02:53:54.975 --> 02:53:56.718
Guzman is the mover.

02:53:56.778 --> 02:53:58.200
Whitmore is the second.

02:54:01.319 --> 02:54:02.721
Uh, any discussion on it?

02:54:03.702 --> 02:54:03.883
Yeah.

02:54:03.903 --> 02:54:04.243
Director.

02:54:04.263 --> 02:54:09.671
I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting for this.

02:54:10.292 --> 02:54:22.289
Um, I was, uh, not necessarily sure how this would further the clean energy and zero emission goals of the state of Colorado.

02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:26.895
Um, and, uh, therefore we'll just be voting now.

02:54:26.936 --> 02:54:27.276
Thank you.

02:54:29.652 --> 02:54:32.037
Any further conversation, Secretary Nicholson?

02:54:33.701 --> 02:54:37.689
Yeah, so I understand where we're the importance of what we're doing here.

02:54:39.313 --> 02:54:44.364
I think that these buses in particular, you know, in my religion, there's a thing.

02:54:44.444 --> 02:54:46.208
Why is this night different from all other nights?

02:54:46.248 --> 02:54:48.673
Why are these buses different from all other buses?

02:54:49.902 --> 02:54:54.088
These are going to be the flagship of our flagship BRT line.

02:54:54.929 --> 02:55:01.597
And if these suck, it will kill BRT.

02:55:02.118 --> 02:55:12.271
And if they are not comfortable, if they are not just awesome in every way possible, you know, you can make a lot of choices when you buy a bus about how nice it's going to be.

02:55:12.311 --> 02:55:16.517
In the same way, you can make a lot of choices about when you buy a car about how nice it's going to be.

02:55:16.497 --> 02:55:26.013
And so I just want to lean in here, and I do have one question, to say that we need to pull the stops out.

02:55:26.113 --> 02:55:41.037
We need to make sure we're giving you enough money, GMCO Johnson, to make sure we're buying top of the line, to make sure that these are things that when they run through my district, people go, wow, I want to get on that, not

02:55:41.017 --> 02:55:42.739
Wow, that doesn't look very nice.

02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:51.988
And so my question for you is, how do you know that the amount of money that we're authorizing today is enough to get top of the line?

02:55:52.008 --> 02:56:03.200
And how many bytes at the Apple are we going to get to make sure that you are buying the right buses for this incredibly important project?

02:56:04.421 --> 02:56:04.601
Ms.

02:56:04.641 --> 02:56:08.505
Johnson is 51 million enough to make them not suck?

02:56:08.525 --> 02:56:09.066
Yeah.

02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:12.922
So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

02:56:13.583 --> 02:56:15.565
And thank you for the question.

02:56:16.285 --> 02:56:17.246
My apologies.

02:56:17.266 --> 02:56:18.187
That was a perfect question.

02:56:18.427 --> 02:56:23.511
Keep it in mind, this is a budget transfer and full transparency.

02:56:24.032 --> 02:56:28.576
Director Nicholson emailed me about this because I think there was some confusion about where we are.

02:56:28.876 --> 02:56:30.477
There is yet to be a solicitation.

02:56:30.537 --> 02:56:32.359
There's yet to be specifications.

02:56:32.739 --> 02:56:39.525
So these monies that are being transferred or needed

02:56:39.927 --> 02:56:42.250
for all intents and purposes so we can start a procurement.

02:56:44.694 --> 02:56:47.698
Now, keeping in mind, there's a couple of elements.

02:56:48.038 --> 02:56:56.230
These buses have to be dedicated because this is designated as a bus rapid transit project as defined by the Federal Transit Administration.

02:56:56.670 --> 02:57:02.278
There's certain criteria that we have to ensure that we adhere to.

02:57:02.298 --> 02:57:09.428
This will be a dedicated fleet just by virtue of the configuration of BRT with it being a center running platform.

02:57:09.965 --> 02:57:20.884
So when you talk about it being top of the line, that's yet to be seen in reference to what we have before us because there's only two original equipment manufacturers in the United States.

02:57:20.924 --> 02:57:22.487
There's only so many suppliers.

02:57:22.847 --> 02:57:31.382
There are certain seeds and there is a national task force on which I sit where we're talking about doing away with customization because that increases prices.

02:57:31.632 --> 02:57:35.656
I bet you don't know how many shades of white there is with new flier industries.

02:57:35.676 --> 02:57:36.176
24.

02:57:36.216 --> 02:57:37.537
How many?

02:57:37.557 --> 02:57:37.658
24.

02:57:37.678 --> 02:57:38.739
23.

02:57:38.999 --> 02:57:40.760
I think I told you that earlier.

02:57:40.841 --> 02:57:58.357
So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this right, we're going to do our due diligence and we're going to ensure it's a competitive solicitation and we do understand the aspects because that's what separates bus rapid transit from general thick route service.

02:57:59.258 --> 02:57:59.698
Thank you.

02:58:00.337 --> 02:58:02.781
Secretary, I really appreciate it.

02:58:02.821 --> 02:58:07.548
And I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how the purchase is going.

02:58:09.931 --> 02:58:10.191
Yes.

02:58:10.472 --> 02:58:21.448
Uh, director Griswold just really quickly, uh, with regards to this, moving this money from the unrestricted fund is simply to begin the procurement process.

02:58:21.969 --> 02:58:25.734
And although it's not part of the 2025 budget, we do need to get started on it.

02:58:26.455 --> 02:58:28.318
Um, however, I would suggest

02:58:28.518 --> 02:58:34.447
that as we go forward, these buses are meant to be purchased in finality by 2027 to begin this service.

02:58:35.068 --> 02:58:46.624
And that is work that we will do to fully do on finance and planning to ensure that it is included in all necessary documents that come before this board for approval.

02:58:47.546 --> 02:58:50.330
And I am certain that our new CFO is up to the task on that.

02:58:50.430 --> 02:58:56.719
So rest assured, directors, we're not wantonly spending money, but we do need to authorize

02:58:57.273 --> 02:59:19.872
this for the procurement of the buses at this point thank you thank you director any further discussion on this item all right there is a note oh no sounds good all right i was it was indicated there will be a no vote so i'll do a roll call vote again this is the budget transfer articulate articulated buses supporting coal fax vrt service uh treasure banker

02:59:20.307 --> 02:59:20.808
Yes.

02:59:21.289 --> 02:59:21.970
Dr. Catlin.

02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:23.332
Yes.

02:59:23.352 --> 02:59:24.073
Dr. Geisinger.

02:59:24.273 --> 02:59:24.995
Yes.

02:59:25.015 --> 02:59:25.736
Dr. Guciniter.

02:59:26.096 --> 02:59:26.377
Yes.

02:59:26.858 --> 02:59:27.459
Dr. Guzman.

02:59:27.939 --> 02:59:28.160
Yes.

02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:29.021
Dr. Harwick.

02:59:29.221 --> 02:59:29.362
Yep.

02:59:29.702 --> 02:59:30.383
Dr. Larsen.

02:59:30.544 --> 02:59:30.824
Yes.

02:59:30.964 --> 02:59:31.705
Dr. Nicholson.

02:59:32.226 --> 02:59:33.428
Nicholson Gauper.

02:59:35.211 --> 02:59:35.912
What?

02:59:35.932 --> 02:59:36.333
Sorry.

02:59:36.353 --> 02:59:37.515
That was a bad internet wreck.

02:59:37.535 --> 02:59:37.775
Yes.

02:59:38.977 --> 02:59:39.798
Nicholson is a yes.

02:59:39.879 --> 02:59:40.780
Director O'Keeffe.

02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:44.592
Director O'Keith is a yes.

02:59:45.072 --> 02:59:45.913
Director Pagulari?

02:59:46.074 --> 02:59:46.334
No.

02:59:46.815 --> 02:59:47.876
Director Pagulari is a no.

02:59:47.936 --> 02:59:48.637
Director Arusha?

02:59:48.857 --> 02:59:49.758
Yes.

02:59:49.778 --> 02:59:50.439
Director Whitmore?

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:53.503
Yes.

02:59:53.523 --> 02:59:53.583
OK.

02:59:53.603 --> 02:59:56.627
So that passes 12, 1, and 2.

02:59:57.528 --> 02:59:57.828
All right.

02:59:57.868 --> 02:59:58.509
Thank you, folks.

02:59:58.569 --> 02:59:59.410
So we have one.

03:00:00.011 --> 03:00:01.313
Chair Buke, could you remind us?

03:00:01.633 --> 03:00:06.439
Over here, we missed who the mover and the seconder were on that.

03:00:06.799 --> 03:00:07.781
I had Guzman and Whitmore.

03:00:08.281 --> 03:00:08.361
OK.

03:00:08.381 --> 03:00:08.682
Thank you.

03:00:09.403 --> 03:00:09.703
Thank you.

03:00:10.578 --> 03:00:11.459
Um, okay.

03:00:11.479 --> 03:00:11.819
Excellent.

03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:13.621
Uh, thank you all again for your patience.

03:00:13.661 --> 03:00:19.568
We do have one more item and that is the equitable transit oriented development policy amendment.

03:00:20.929 --> 03:00:36.045
So for the board of directors to approve the amendment to resolution number two series of 2021, which created the equal transit oriented development policy that permits and encourages the development of affordable housing on RTD real property in order to include guidelines for disposing.

03:00:36.312 --> 03:00:40.378
of RTD real property below fair market value or rent.

03:00:40.739 --> 03:00:41.400
Do we have a motion?

03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:41.961
So moved.

03:00:41.981 --> 03:00:42.321
Guzman.

03:00:42.522 --> 03:00:43.303
Guzman is the mover.

03:00:43.343 --> 03:00:43.924
Do we have a second?

03:00:44.445 --> 03:00:45.587
I have Harwick as a second.

03:00:47.550 --> 03:00:52.838
I do understand that on this item, we have some proposed amendments from Director Nicholson and Director Ruscha.

03:00:53.780 --> 03:00:57.626
Since Director Nicholson's amendment was circulated to the board first, we will start there.

03:00:58.247 --> 03:01:01.071
Director Nicholson, please now make your motion to amend.

03:01:01.675 --> 03:01:15.846
Yes, I'd like to move to amend the etod policy and I'm hoping that GMC GMC that Mr. Crawl can put up those that language on the screen.

03:01:16.808 --> 03:01:17.229
It's there.

03:01:17.890 --> 03:01:18.071
Right.

03:01:19.774 --> 03:01:20.055
May I.

03:01:21.470 --> 03:01:24.234
Uh, would you like to read the motion and then we'll get a second.

03:01:24.374 --> 03:01:24.735
Thank you.

03:01:24.775 --> 03:01:25.055
Yeah.

03:01:25.315 --> 03:01:39.495
So, uh, move to amend the policy, uh, such that section five of the equitable transit oriented development policy regarding negotiated land price be updated as follows to raise the maximum negotiated land price discount to 75% from 50%.

03:01:39.475 --> 03:02:08.942
and add the following additional factors to favorably consider projects which include more accessible units than required by law, limit residential parking, are deeply affordable, emphasize priority groups as identified by the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, and incorporate smaller footprint retail, including below market rate units, below market rate retail, excuse me, that prioritizes local businesses and entrepreneurs.

03:02:09.125 --> 03:02:13.251
Excellent.

03:02:13.271 --> 03:02:14.192
And do we have a second on that?

03:02:14.793 --> 03:02:15.134
Second.

03:02:15.454 --> 03:02:16.275
Hard work is the second.

03:02:18.458 --> 03:02:20.261
Secretary, would you like to discuss further?

03:02:20.281 --> 03:02:20.662
Thank you.

03:02:20.682 --> 03:02:20.882
Yes.

03:02:21.222 --> 03:02:33.580
Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll to briefly describe the five pieces of written public comment that we received on this recommended action from some of our local public officials.

03:02:34.083 --> 03:02:42.215
Yes, so four of the written public common items were submitted by individuals specifically supportive of the change director Nicholson is offering.

03:02:42.255 --> 03:02:51.889
And those four individuals were the mayor of Boulder, a city council member from Boulder, a city council member from Westminster and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.

03:02:51.869 --> 03:03:05.954
And then the fifth letter was submitted by SWEAP in joint with Conservation Colorado and Denver Streets Partnership, which spoke more broadly to the overall changes being offered this evening.

03:03:08.799 --> 03:03:09.420
Perfect, Secretary.

03:03:09.881 --> 03:03:11.083
Thank you.

03:03:11.204 --> 03:03:13.708
And thank you, Executive Manager Crawl.

03:03:14.465 --> 03:03:17.249
So here at RTD, we make lives better through connections.

03:03:17.610 --> 03:03:21.195
Tonight as a board, we have an opportunity to do that in a particularly powerful way.

03:03:22.076 --> 03:03:23.999
Our rider surveys tell a clear story.

03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:31.129
Over half our passengers live below 200% of the federal poverty level, and they are far less likely to own a car.

03:03:31.870 --> 03:03:38.700
Our riders with disabilities use RTD at disproportionately high rates, as do other vulnerable populations in our community.

03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:45.569
Yet only a fraction of affordable housing developed near our stations truly meets the needs of our most dedicated riders.

03:03:46.250 --> 03:03:50.236
Communities in our state have struggled to create housing targeted at our ridership.

03:03:50.636 --> 03:03:57.505
Inclusionary zoning has mostly led to housing at 60% AMI, about $51,000 a year in earnings.

03:03:57.525 --> 03:04:06.257
This housing is necessary but priced well out of reach for someone making only $31,000, which is 200% of the federal poverty line.

03:04:06.237 --> 03:04:15.612
This amendment empowers RTD to deepen our land discount offerings, up to 75%, to incentivize projects specifically tailored to the actual economic realities of our riders.

03:04:16.273 --> 03:04:17.996
Here's how that can work in practice.

03:04:18.016 --> 03:04:25.208
Just this month, Denver Health donated the land to create Tapestry, a deeply affordable, accessible, transit-oriented housing project.

03:04:25.627 --> 03:04:34.674
It supports a range of affordability from 30% to 80%, as well as far more three-bedroom and even four-bedroom units than most affordable projects being built today.

03:04:35.456 --> 03:04:38.505
It targets accessibility because distance to transit

03:04:38.755 --> 03:04:42.262
is a major barrier for people with disabilities to use transit.

03:04:42.703 --> 03:04:51.582
This holds for all types of disabilities, and unfortunately, painfully few Class A fully accessible units exist in the RTD service area.

03:04:52.143 --> 03:04:56.933
By creating greater incentives for developers, we can do a lot to play our part in fixing that.

03:04:57.082 --> 03:05:03.591
It's late, so I won't go through the argument for reduced parking and the service of CHFA's priority populations.

03:05:03.892 --> 03:05:05.514
You all have an email from me with that data.

03:05:06.015 --> 03:05:12.464
But I do want Director Harwick to speak after me to address the language he added on smaller footprint and below market retail.

03:05:13.285 --> 03:05:19.714
Community is about more than housing, and I enthusiastically added his language for the reasons he'll highlight.

03:05:19.947 --> 03:05:24.674
This framework recognizes that we are not the housing policy experts.

03:05:25.195 --> 03:05:44.164
It increases the scope of our tools and trusts our staff to use them effectively to bring us thoughtful projects, projects that align with our strategic priority of community value and enable us to grow ridership by putting the people who most need transit where they can best be served by it.

03:05:44.665 --> 03:05:46.788
I ask your support for this amendment.

03:05:47.469 --> 03:05:47.690
Thank you.

03:05:47.710 --> 03:05:48.030
Dr. Harbert.

03:05:49.512 --> 03:06:05.817
Yeah, so I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD that we're really thinking also about mixed use TOD and I'm wildly in favor of Anything that we can do to bring more housing let alone affordable housing to

03:06:05.797 --> 03:06:06.999
To our park and rides.

03:06:07.019 --> 03:06:27.568
I do think it's really key that we also think about what are the businesses that we are bringing in there and You know having spent a lot of time working at Starbucks and a good friend of mine works at Starbucks You know, I'm also really in favor of coffee shops like Prodigy and smaller shops, but also thinking about when I've traveled to other

03:06:27.548 --> 03:06:49.995
Communities throughout the world there oftentimes are smaller retail shops that give young entrepreneurs that opportunity to start a business and not be burdened by a larger footprint that Some of our larger restaurants or larger retail shops can they can cover those those costs so you know this this to me was a way to encourage local businesses to

03:06:49.975 --> 03:07:05.706
start up or expand and, you know, give them the opportunity in a place that we all, you know, we all, when we go to a parking ride and there's not something there to grab that quick bite to eat, I want to give them that opportunity, everyone that opportunity, one to shop there and sell there.

03:07:07.089 --> 03:07:07.890
Thank you, Director Harwick.

03:07:08.632 --> 03:07:10.115
Any further discussion on this amendment?

03:07:11.217 --> 03:07:11.798
Director Usha.

03:07:12.082 --> 03:07:14.366
Uh, Mr. Chair, maybe you can help me here.

03:07:14.446 --> 03:07:19.775
So I had a comment slash, but I had a comment on the main motion, but we moved to amendments.

03:07:20.216 --> 03:07:26.126
But like recognizing that Secretary Nicholson's language can't exist without the motion language or the way it's drafted.

03:07:26.346 --> 03:07:28.289
May I just make a general comment?

03:07:28.310 --> 03:07:29.371
Does it sort of make sense?

03:07:29.391 --> 03:07:32.957
It would apply to both, but I don't know if I would be called out of order and I'm tired.

03:07:33.779 --> 03:07:34.420
I don't know what you say.

03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:34.921
You know what?

03:07:35.081 --> 03:07:35.502
Why not?

03:07:35.562 --> 03:07:36.543
Let's give it a try.

03:07:36.564 --> 03:07:37.465
Okay, thanks.

03:07:37.445 --> 03:07:38.126
I'm doing my best.

03:07:38.666 --> 03:07:50.480
Okay, so this morning we got an email from staff that addressed some outstanding questions that I still had just so I knew what I was voting on.

03:07:51.040 --> 03:08:03.975
And I have a heartburn over just the main motion because the way it's written, we as a board

03:08:04.327 --> 03:08:17.864
are not just expanding the bounds of what a policy is, we're also signing away like 30 plus years of precedent of having this guardrail that says, before you go dispense of real property, get our preliminary authorization.

03:08:18.484 --> 03:08:26.454
So I guess like, so I am already a little bit uncomfortable.

03:08:26.855 --> 03:08:29.558
And also the policy says that if

03:08:29.943 --> 03:08:36.430
A developer, as it relates to housing, cannot meet our 50% standard.

03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:41.936
They could still get a major discount, and it could be millions and millions of dollars.

03:08:42.496 --> 03:08:49.163
And so those two combined, and just recognizing that these deals take a long, long time, they're not suburb projects.

03:08:50.645 --> 03:08:59.494
In sum, it means that all of that is going to happen, and then it's going to come back to the board when all of those decisions have been made.

03:08:59.693 --> 03:09:19.086
and that and so it's for that because I'm struggling with the original proposal but I can accept it for now is why I can't vote yes on Secretary Nicholson's amendment because it doesn't because we don't have guardrails that I would prefer so I

03:09:19.454 --> 03:09:23.541
I hope that was not out of order, and if it was, thanks for not calling me out of order.

03:09:23.561 --> 03:09:23.922
Thank you.

03:09:24.202 --> 03:09:24.963
Thank you, Director.

03:09:25.324 --> 03:09:25.865
Director Guzman.

03:09:26.726 --> 03:09:33.498
So, ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee, and this is my concern.

03:09:36.302 --> 03:09:41.952
Although I am with you in spirit, deeply affordable housing is really important.

03:09:42.353 --> 03:09:51.044
I'm not sure that giving an additional 25% discount in our policy is wise for a number of reasons.

03:09:51.605 --> 03:09:56.532
I do believe, however, and maybe Madam CEO or Ms.

03:09:56.572 --> 03:09:59.215
Chessie Brady might be able to speak to this, I'm not sure.

03:10:01.058 --> 03:10:08.327
What we were asked for in this policy was to give guidelines to begin negotiation that would eventually come back to this board.

03:10:09.539 --> 03:10:21.702
let's say a developer comes to us and just brings us an amazing proposal that includes everything that you could want in a development and more.

03:10:21.722 --> 03:10:32.222
I don't see why they wouldn't necessarily come back to us and say hey they're willing to do all of these things, they being staff and asking for an additional amount of up to

03:10:32.945 --> 03:10:43.482
whatever amount makes sense to give that discount from the board that we would consider properly and then be able to authorize in that moment.

03:10:44.244 --> 03:10:50.714
But in order to begin the process, we were simply asked to give authorization for them to work within a parameter.

03:10:50.774 --> 03:10:57.125
That way there was no confusion that they would be able to do a 30 to 50% discount as was written in the original policy.

03:10:57.626 --> 03:10:58.547
Beyond that,

03:10:59.236 --> 03:11:06.247
the board would still have authority, as I understand it, if we were asked to offer an additional discount for more.

03:11:06.888 --> 03:11:24.636
I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of the agency.

03:11:24.796 --> 03:11:26.779
And so I would like to ask that question

03:11:27.265 --> 03:11:40.238
Is there anything that would prevent you from coming back to us if we were to receive such an excellent proposal that prevents you from saying, can we receive an additional discount to offer a developer board?

03:11:40.980 --> 03:11:43.165
And would you approve this so we can make a project work?

03:11:44.967 --> 03:11:45.127
Ms.

03:11:45.167 --> 03:11:46.890
Brady, first off, thank you for your patience.

03:11:46.930 --> 03:11:48.952
I greatly appreciate you sticking around tonight.

03:11:48.993 --> 03:11:49.433
Of course.

03:11:49.774 --> 03:11:51.055
You're recognized.

03:11:51.376 --> 03:11:51.716
Thank you.

03:11:52.357 --> 03:11:55.301
No, there is nothing that would stop us from doing that.

03:11:55.762 --> 03:12:01.490
As you say, the point of the policy is to create guardrails and certainty within those guardrails.

03:12:02.231 --> 03:12:11.503
We would use the opinions of the board to guide developers towards what we think the board would be interested in as we're negotiating with them.

03:12:11.584 --> 03:12:12.645
And we would come back to the board

03:12:12.963 --> 03:12:15.085
for approval of any given project.

03:12:15.906 --> 03:12:16.246
Thank you.

03:12:17.047 --> 03:12:18.048
One more quick thing.

03:12:18.388 --> 03:12:29.278
And director banker, treasurer banker, the sales and the lease income from our real estate properties are put into a specific account.

03:12:29.298 --> 03:12:30.239
Can you guess which one?

03:12:30.979 --> 03:12:42.750
Because when we deeply discount things beyond where we should, we are saying no to the potential income that we could use for operations and maintenance and service provision

03:12:43.405 --> 03:12:44.486
elsewhere in the agency.

03:12:45.147 --> 03:12:52.754
So on balance, real estate and real property are a finite resource, and dollars can be stretched thin.

03:12:53.515 --> 03:13:04.166
But how we use the opportunity to either receive money to prolong and serve the public further is a huge consideration in this.

03:13:04.386 --> 03:13:09.031
So although I am with you in spirit, I would be voting no on the amendment as it is right now.

03:13:09.711 --> 03:13:10.312
Thank you, Director.

03:13:11.273 --> 03:13:12.214
Director Pagulieri.

03:13:12.481 --> 03:13:13.482
Thank you, I'll be brief.

03:13:14.563 --> 03:13:19.287
I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply agree with.

03:13:20.068 --> 03:13:21.630
I am a little bit concerned about two things.

03:13:21.670 --> 03:13:24.352
The first is the language deeply affordable.

03:13:24.813 --> 03:13:29.177
It's a little bit ambiguous, if I'm saying that right.

03:13:30.118 --> 03:13:40.868
And I think using language like that can, like, what's to say, they discounted $100 to some, that's a deep discount to others, that's nothing.

03:13:40.848 --> 03:13:48.758
So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can divine it elsewhere.

03:13:49.279 --> 03:13:51.482
But I do want to leave this language.

03:13:51.502 --> 03:13:58.751
And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that I want.

03:13:59.352 --> 03:14:05.259
And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75%.

03:14:05.820 --> 03:14:10.686
But this is our property and I really

03:14:10.666 --> 03:14:16.572
I would like to see it sold for the highest value to benefit all.

03:14:16.772 --> 03:14:17.132
Thank you.

03:14:17.152 --> 03:14:19.074
Thank you, Director.

03:14:19.094 --> 03:14:19.675
Treasure Banker?

03:14:21.657 --> 03:14:23.218
Just a quick question.

03:14:23.739 --> 03:14:31.146
Some of these surplus properties that we're talking about, we are not including our current park and rides, correct?

03:14:32.147 --> 03:14:38.513
Would be excess land perhaps around a park and ride, but not one of our park and rides?

03:14:39.758 --> 03:14:40.799
Just clarification.

03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:42.041
Thank you.

03:14:42.061 --> 03:14:45.946
So this policy is aimed at transit oriented development.

03:14:45.986 --> 03:14:46.467
So pop.

03:14:46.487 --> 03:15:05.091
So property that RTD owns at transit stations or near near high frequency transit, um, excess property and surplus property are definable terms that, you know, perhaps Michelle could help us with, but those are, um, distinctive properties that, that the board has named to be excess and surplus.

03:15:05.531 --> 03:15:05.952
And so,

03:15:06.353 --> 03:15:08.236
I just want to separate that from a park and ride.

03:15:08.256 --> 03:15:10.240
A park and ride is certainly not access or surplus.

03:15:11.081 --> 03:15:13.325
It may have underutilized land.

03:15:13.525 --> 03:15:27.289
It may have a large drainage area that is part of the park and ride, but not every development that we would consider on a park and ride would remove parking if that's getting more to your question.

03:15:28.090 --> 03:15:28.791
Okay, yes.

03:15:31.275 --> 03:15:32.277
Secretary Nicholson.

03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:35.972
I actually have some questions for Ms.

03:15:36.493 --> 03:15:36.813
Brady.

03:15:37.454 --> 03:15:42.239
So first off, Director Pagliari raised the concern about the term deep affordability.

03:15:42.859 --> 03:15:47.464
I think you and I know what that means, but maybe the rest of the board doesn't, given it's a term of art.

03:15:47.505 --> 03:15:51.189
Can you elaborate on what that's referring to?

03:15:51.929 --> 03:15:52.110
Ms.

03:15:52.130 --> 03:15:52.390
Brady.

03:15:52.830 --> 03:15:53.111
Sure.

03:15:53.191 --> 03:15:53.351
Yes.

03:15:53.671 --> 03:16:01.740
Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means generally 30 to 40% of AMI.

03:16:02.159 --> 03:16:07.278
It is squishy, I think still, but generally it's understood to mean 30 to 40%.

03:16:07.338 --> 03:16:09.486
Secretary.

03:16:09.905 --> 03:16:17.214
So second question, I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as a discount.

03:16:18.896 --> 03:16:32.393
I was hoping maybe you could speak to like, because I mentioned it a little bit, but as someone who's an expert in the space, and I will say you and I worked pretty closely together on this language and went back and forth, you did a meeting with me.

03:16:32.473 --> 03:16:34.876
So this isn't just something that I wrote myself.

03:16:34.956 --> 03:16:39.321
This is something that got vetted pretty heavily by staff.

03:16:40.229 --> 03:16:55.869
What impact does a greater discount have on the types of projects that in the affordable housing space you tend to see people able to build?

03:16:55.909 --> 03:17:00.094
At least from where I sit, the reason for doing this is that

03:17:00.074 --> 03:17:09.686
When it comes to those deeply affordable, which are deeply subsidized units, when it comes to things like units that are fully accessible, those are expensive.

03:17:09.947 --> 03:17:16.395
They cost developers money, which is why when you don't have those subsidies, those units don't get built.

03:17:16.455 --> 03:17:22.082
I think it's about half the projects that are in the CHFA database have zero units.

03:17:22.062 --> 03:17:28.308
at 30% AMI, and very few of them have anything with regard to accessibility.

03:17:28.328 --> 03:17:34.393
So I'm hoping you can maybe elaborate on, you know, you're the one who would be using this tool at the end of the day.

03:17:34.433 --> 03:17:39.077
How do you see it coming in handy with regard to what you're able to do?

03:17:39.698 --> 03:17:41.159
And then I have one last follow up.

03:17:42.981 --> 03:17:43.341
It's pretty.

03:17:46.804 --> 03:17:51.428
You're not.

03:17:53.804 --> 03:17:57.909
Thank you.

03:17:58.650 --> 03:18:02.656
So affordable housing projects aren't notoriously difficult to finance.

03:18:03.337 --> 03:18:13.971
And I mean, I think if you use the example earlier of tapestry and Denver Health, Denver Health, as you stated, is correct, donated the land for tapestry.

03:18:14.011 --> 03:18:18.056
I can assure you that that development was still very difficult to finance.

03:18:18.937 --> 03:18:23.423
So even if the land we were giving the land at 100%,

03:18:23.774 --> 03:18:28.839
discount the projects would still not pencil in many cases.

03:18:29.400 --> 03:18:51.604
And so our ability to discount the land to 75% as the board prefers just in many cases could get us over the hump from a project not being built to a project being built and to that project having more affordable units as opposed to a higher, more of a middle income range.

03:18:51.905 --> 03:18:54.588
And that's the difference that the land discount makes.

03:18:54.949 --> 03:19:05.561
And that's the certainty that this policy helps me bring to conversations with developers is, gets them in the mindset of we're going to get some help here from RTD.

03:19:06.342 --> 03:19:08.945
We can focus on deeper affordability units.

03:19:08.965 --> 03:19:14.531
We can make bigger promises to Chaffa or other financing entities to host in Denver.

03:19:15.192 --> 03:19:18.756
And it helps us keep the projects moving.

03:19:19.073 --> 03:19:21.417
Um, but, and I'd be frank with you.

03:19:21.457 --> 03:19:26.886
This is, as I said, tapestry, even with a hundred percent discount, it's still hard to do.

03:19:27.066 --> 03:19:28.989
This is not a silver bullet.

03:19:29.009 --> 03:19:34.979
Um, but it, it moves the needle and it helps us actually, you know, keep projects afloat and get to the finish line.

03:19:35.399 --> 03:19:35.840
Thank you, Ms.

03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:36.221
Brady.

03:19:36.461 --> 03:19:39.827
We're going to wrap up with director O'Keefe and then director Larson.

03:19:40.307 --> 03:19:42.010
Oh, I thought I got last word.

03:19:42.682 --> 03:19:45.707
So I support this amendment.

03:19:45.848 --> 03:19:56.987
I think it is a reasonable step toward developing communities that are very likely to use our services.

03:19:57.148 --> 03:20:01.315
And I think increasing ridership is something

03:20:01.447 --> 03:20:02.488
we all agree on.

03:20:02.508 --> 03:20:04.731
This is a concrete way to do that.

03:20:05.873 --> 03:20:15.886
It also takes land, not just for our benefit in ridership, but also puts improvements on it that helps the tax base.

03:20:16.307 --> 03:20:30.205
And I think the communities that we serve would rather see a housing project end up on that property where it becomes improved.

03:20:30.185 --> 03:20:31.648
versus somewhere else.

03:20:31.688 --> 03:20:32.990
We're not the only game in town.

03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:34.653
There's a lot of discounts out there.

03:20:34.674 --> 03:20:41.386
And so we're not necessarily in a tight buyer's market.

03:20:41.486 --> 03:20:43.751
There's a lot of projects that can go forward.

03:20:44.452 --> 03:20:52.868
And I think we need to put our best deal, at least give Chessie and the rest of the team the tools to bring the deal forward.

03:20:52.848 --> 03:20:55.053
I do want to put one plug in.

03:20:55.153 --> 03:20:55.995
We talked about it.

03:20:56.296 --> 03:21:01.247
I don't think ground leases are the best tool in Colorado.

03:21:01.287 --> 03:21:04.655
First of all, it's not as common as other places in the world.

03:21:05.296 --> 03:21:10.789
And the other thing is toward the end of your ground lease, no matter how long you make it,

03:21:10.769 --> 03:21:13.492
the property will fall into disrepair.

03:21:13.773 --> 03:21:18.999
They are not going to put money into physical facilities that are going to roll off their books.

03:21:19.680 --> 03:21:26.929
So for that reason, I like the discount is great and I love a sale versus a ground lease.

03:21:26.949 --> 03:21:29.232
And I know you'll keep that in mind as we go forward.

03:21:29.953 --> 03:21:38.363
And anyway, that's another argument in favor of that tactic.

03:21:40.182 --> 03:21:40.663
Thank you.

03:21:41.284 --> 03:21:42.926
I'm going to be a no vote on this.

03:21:43.286 --> 03:21:48.614
I don't, I don't agree with our transit oriented development policy as it is right now.

03:21:48.834 --> 03:21:55.604
I don't agree with the goal of trying to provide affordable housing or encourage it, incentivize it.

03:21:55.984 --> 03:21:59.910
I think we should be focused on trying to increase ridership.

03:22:00.070 --> 03:22:09.784
If we want to provide discounts on our land, we should provide them with the goal in mind of increasing the number of people that can live

03:22:10.186 --> 03:22:15.051
on the property, whatever is developed, and the amount of traffic that is on the property.

03:22:16.212 --> 03:22:18.674
So I'm a no on this.

03:22:19.355 --> 03:22:20.235
Thank you, Director Larson.

03:22:20.396 --> 03:22:20.676
All right.

03:22:21.116 --> 03:22:23.078
The indication there is a no vote.

03:22:23.438 --> 03:22:24.960
I am going to do a roll call vote.

03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:28.183
As a reminder, we are voting on Director Nicholson's amendment.

03:22:28.683 --> 03:22:31.586
He was the mover and Director Harwick is the second.

03:22:32.387 --> 03:22:33.107
Treasure banker.

03:22:33.147 --> 03:22:36.611
Yes.

03:22:36.651 --> 03:22:37.311
Director Catlin.

03:22:38.773 --> 03:22:39.113
Yes.

03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:40.721
Director Keisinger?

03:22:41.041 --> 03:22:41.582
Yes.

03:22:41.602 --> 03:22:42.423
Director Gutschnerner?

03:22:42.944 --> 03:22:43.204
Yes.

03:22:43.484 --> 03:22:44.165
Director Guzman?

03:22:44.446 --> 03:22:44.606
No.

03:22:45.607 --> 03:22:46.228
Director Harwick?

03:22:46.408 --> 03:22:46.628
Yes.

03:22:47.569 --> 03:22:48.290
Director Larsen?

03:22:49.271 --> 03:22:49.472
No.

03:22:50.553 --> 03:22:51.314
Secretary Nicholson?

03:22:51.794 --> 03:22:52.015
Yes.

03:22:52.916 --> 03:22:53.757
First Vice-Chair O'Keefe?

03:22:54.558 --> 03:22:54.778
Yes.

03:22:55.339 --> 03:22:56.140
Director Pagulari?

03:22:56.600 --> 03:22:56.841
Yes.

03:22:57.421 --> 03:22:58.062
Director Ruscha?

03:23:00.725 --> 03:23:01.306
Sorry, no.

03:23:02.227 --> 03:23:03.649
And finally, Second Vice-Chair Whitmore?

03:23:04.210 --> 03:23:04.510
Yes.

03:23:05.317 --> 03:23:16.513
Okay, and I am a yes, that amendment will pass 10, two, excuse me, 10, three and two.

03:23:18.697 --> 03:23:23.484
Yes, 10, yes, three, no, two absent, that is the math.

03:23:24.105 --> 03:23:30.514
Okay, moving on, we are gonna do our second amendment, which was brought forward by Director Ruscha.

03:23:31.979 --> 03:23:35.383
And Director Ruscha, would you like to introduce the language of the amendment?

03:23:37.286 --> 03:23:40.189
It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman.

03:23:40.890 --> 03:23:45.656
And I can make a motion.

03:23:45.716 --> 03:23:45.997
Sorry.

03:23:46.197 --> 03:23:47.519
I think he has the language in front of him.

03:23:47.919 --> 03:23:48.560
Director Guzman.

03:23:49.081 --> 03:23:50.062
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

03:23:50.102 --> 03:24:01.176
We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end of this policy that says, additionally, no project will be eligible for any discounts unless it complies with the greater of the following.

03:24:01.983 --> 03:24:13.384
5% of all units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities and an additional 2% of all units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities or to current U.S.

03:24:13.404 --> 03:24:16.470
Department of Housing, Urban Development Accessibility requirements.

03:24:18.755 --> 03:24:19.536
Do we have a second?

03:24:20.579 --> 03:24:21.620
We have Russia's second.

03:24:22.962 --> 03:24:23.763
Uh, Mr. Croll.

03:24:23.783 --> 03:24:24.124
I'm sorry.

03:24:24.464 --> 03:24:36.080
Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the highlighted portion above would be deleted and is not included in your motion.

03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:36.500
Correct?

03:24:36.581 --> 03:24:36.921
Correct.

03:24:37.241 --> 03:24:39.965
Correct.

03:24:39.985 --> 03:24:43.710
So the language we see, this would substitute the language.

03:24:44.311 --> 03:24:44.551
Okay.

03:24:44.712 --> 03:24:45.052
Perfect.

03:24:45.452 --> 03:24:48.156
Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get this done.

03:24:49.778 --> 03:24:50.299
Director Russia.

03:24:51.764 --> 03:24:56.629
I was happy to speak to motion, but I wasn't sure if we were... I'm tired.

03:24:56.950 --> 03:24:57.310
Is that okay?

03:24:58.411 --> 03:25:02.576
I got Guzman as the mover, and Risha as the second, and we're up for a conversation.

03:25:02.636 --> 03:25:02.796
Okay.

03:25:02.816 --> 03:25:03.557
You're up, Director Risha.

03:25:03.917 --> 03:25:04.438
Thank you, sir.

03:25:04.458 --> 03:25:09.824
Okay, so just for everyone's identification, we struck the first sentence.

03:25:09.884 --> 03:25:14.329
It was a two-sentence amendment, just recognizing that we didn't have

03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:20.676
full staff concurrence on the first sentence, which would have applied this accessibility minimum to market rate housing.

03:25:21.557 --> 03:25:25.822
And sometimes you shoot for the stars and land on the moon.

03:25:26.843 --> 03:25:34.030
The second sentence, which just applies the HUD requirement to affordable housing, we did get staff concurrence.

03:25:34.291 --> 03:25:36.793
So that's just the that was the context behind that.

03:25:38.595 --> 03:25:40.097
I sent out like a

03:25:41.242 --> 03:25:48.529
I kind of frequently ask questions in anticipation of some questions, so I'm happy to entertain any or we can address them.

03:25:49.029 --> 03:26:10.388
I will say that we worked for three weeks and some change on this with housing advocates and folks who had worked in the space and people who had worked at Chaffa and at the state level on similar policy and advocacy organizations and then staff and legal.

03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:32.241
So, I mean, just, I'm sorry, I am tired to, in case anybody has any questions about what this is, I think just simplify it and say the, the, that HUD has a

03:26:32.525 --> 03:26:36.289
current minimum accessibility requirement for funding, right?

03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:44.939
And it's 5% of units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, additional 2% of units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities.

03:26:45.740 --> 03:26:53.368
And so a lot of times in these projects, that HUD requirement is going to kick in, but not all projects are going to have HUD dollars.

03:26:53.969 --> 03:26:59.595
So just recognizing that a lot of jurisdictions take that HUD standard, which is, I

03:26:59.913 --> 03:27:00.454
Maybe Ms.

03:27:00.494 --> 03:27:04.097
Brady can correct me, but I think it's 20 plus years old, 30 plus years old now.

03:27:05.439 --> 03:27:09.743
And they also incorporate that into their policies or their co-order statute.

03:27:10.043 --> 03:27:12.866
We did the same, kind of good for goose, good for gander.

03:27:13.627 --> 03:27:19.253
I will stop there unless anyone else has further questions or comment.

03:27:20.314 --> 03:27:22.336
Questions or comments on this amendment?

03:27:23.677 --> 03:27:27.321
Dr. Catlin, then Secretary Nicholson.

03:27:27.571 --> 03:27:42.689
I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the first amendment that we passed does give a lot of latitude towards Chessie and her staff to negotiate.

03:27:43.390 --> 03:27:51.840
And I fear that this one might be a little bit too regulatory and prescriptive.

03:27:53.542 --> 03:28:03.574
If that's the HUD requirement and somebody is applying for a HUD grant, then this would be taken care of automatically.

03:28:04.175 --> 03:28:13.305
So right now I'm willing to listen to other discussions, but I fear that it would not give Ms.

03:28:13.326 --> 03:28:20.494
Brady and her staff the maximum flexibility to look at the comprehensive merits of a proposal.

03:28:23.309 --> 03:28:24.851
Um, yeah, Ms.

03:28:24.871 --> 03:28:26.132
Spruppy.

03:28:26.312 --> 03:28:26.513
Yeah.

03:28:26.673 --> 03:28:39.327
So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver already requires, for example, and the Colorado Department of Housing is already considering a higher threshold of requirement.

03:28:39.427 --> 03:28:42.230
So I have, I have no concerns about incorporating this.

03:28:42.290 --> 03:28:45.975
I think it, it's already going to be taken care of in most cases.

03:28:46.375 --> 03:28:49.018
If I might, that's kind of my point.

03:28:49.118 --> 03:28:50.700
It seems a little bit redundant.

03:28:54.190 --> 03:28:54.992
Secretary Nicholson.

03:28:56.074 --> 03:28:59.241
I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's all right.

03:29:00.844 --> 03:29:01.405
To the amendment.

03:29:01.606 --> 03:29:02.007
Thank you.

03:29:03.249 --> 03:29:04.632
Just to clarify, that was a question.

03:29:04.672 --> 03:29:06.456
You'd like to offer an amendment to the amendment?

03:29:06.817 --> 03:29:07.017
Yes.

03:29:08.521 --> 03:29:09.162
Let's have an amendment.

03:29:09.378 --> 03:29:10.820
Mr. Krull.

03:29:10.840 --> 03:29:36.567
Technically the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy and this is an amendment to that amendment and at this point you would be amending an amendment to an amendment which is not allowed under Robert's rules so you would need to tackle this amendment as it's being presented and then if you feel so inclined offer an amendment to whatever or

03:29:36.547 --> 03:29:41.368
whatever state the policy is in at that point.

03:29:41.971 --> 03:29:43.317
Rock on, Secretary.

03:29:43.769 --> 03:29:51.682
Yeah, so at that point I would say I'd have to be a no, very simple reason, where it says no project will be eligible.

03:29:51.962 --> 03:30:01.858
We're talking about an equitable TOD policy here, which is specifically focused on using our land to facilitate, like literally the policy is about giving discounts.

03:30:02.439 --> 03:30:09.290
I can't see putting something like this in there unless it is related to said discount.

03:30:09.310 --> 03:30:10.873
So I'd be fine if it said additionally,

03:30:10.853 --> 03:30:28.255
no project receiving a discount will be eligible for any discounts etc unless it complies with but I don't necessarily think it makes sense to do market rate policy in an etod policy thank you secretary i have treasurer banker and then director isha

03:30:28.471 --> 03:30:29.793
It's just real quick.

03:30:29.973 --> 03:30:43.035
Have you perhaps considered something more positive saying something like along the lines greater consideration would be given a project if these items were attained as opposed to make it mandatory?

03:30:46.040 --> 03:30:47.642
Dr. Risha or Dr. Kisman?

03:30:47.662 --> 03:30:50.006
Again, sort of an amendment, but just a thought.

03:30:50.807 --> 03:30:50.948
Thanks.

03:30:50.968 --> 03:30:54.934
So I just want to address what Secretary Nicholson said.

03:30:55.707 --> 03:31:03.735
I might have missed part of the closed captioning, but I think you said you don't think we should be applying accessibility minimums to market rate.

03:31:04.676 --> 03:31:05.217
Okay.

03:31:05.237 --> 03:31:05.818
That's exact.

03:31:06.038 --> 03:31:06.358
We don't.

03:31:06.659 --> 03:31:07.539
So this amendment doesn't do that.

03:31:07.940 --> 03:31:21.074
And the second piece, um, the reason why I didn't say it doesn't reference discounts is because, uh, so this goes at the end of the policy, which is all like the way it's nested under the paragraph, the discount, this is talking about when discounts apply, if that makes sense.

03:31:21.454 --> 03:31:22.255
So it's just,

03:31:23.753 --> 03:31:26.997
It does what you said you wanted it to do.

03:31:27.037 --> 03:31:27.798
It's just late.

03:31:28.518 --> 03:31:29.039
On Nicholson.

03:31:29.259 --> 03:31:29.600
Thank you.

03:31:30.020 --> 03:31:34.205
And then the, I guess the only question I have for, and this is actually for Ms.

03:31:34.225 --> 03:31:35.726
Brady, if that's okay.

03:31:36.247 --> 03:31:48.040
Under what, because you mentioned that Denver has a policy that supersede or that matches this and the state currently is considering a policy that would supersede it, but currently does not.

03:31:48.509 --> 03:31:52.515
Under what circumstances would this have any effect at all?

03:31:52.675 --> 03:32:00.787
Like in what circumstances can you imagine in your professional capacity, do you see this being something that would matter?

03:32:01.869 --> 03:32:02.049
Ms.

03:32:02.069 --> 03:32:02.369
Brady?

03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:07.537
Yes, in a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units.

03:32:07.677 --> 03:32:12.925
And Director Rush has mentioned some, I'm not aware of them, but this is not my area of expertise.

03:32:12.945 --> 03:32:17.892
So, but in a jurisdiction that does not already have those requirements that is not

03:32:18.108 --> 03:32:31.763
accepting HUD money, and if Colorado Department of Housing changes their rules, does not accept Department of Housing money, then that project would then be subject to this policy requirement.

03:32:33.665 --> 03:32:34.085
Thank you, Ms.

03:32:34.125 --> 03:32:34.405
Brady.

03:32:34.726 --> 03:32:35.507
Secretary, quickly.

03:32:36.388 --> 03:32:47.980
Yeah, just, I guess, for Director Rusher, Director Guzman, are there any jurisdictions in the RTD service area that don't have that same requirement that Denver does?

03:32:49.951 --> 03:32:50.732
either directors?

03:32:52.154 --> 03:32:56.842
Yeah, I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate jurisdictions.

03:32:56.902 --> 03:33:05.234
So I'm just going to have to lean into this is E TOD and the E is equitable.

03:33:05.735 --> 03:33:11.143
We spend a lot of time talking about equity today, including spending a significant amount of time talking about people with disabilities.

03:33:11.664 --> 03:33:17.393
And so just again, recognizing that the HUD requirement

03:33:20.444 --> 03:33:38.243
is about equity and not excluding people on the basis of disability from accessing affordable housing, because the Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and other areas of anti-discrimination law, including state law, don't effectively cover that aspect.

03:33:39.444 --> 03:33:42.988
Sorry, that was more than what you asked, but no, I can't answer your question.

03:33:44.730 --> 03:33:46.772
Just like you probably couldn't answer my question.

03:33:47.005 --> 03:33:55.833
about every single jurisdiction in the RTD region that has something regarding parking minimums.

03:33:55.853 --> 03:33:56.974
It's a broad concept.

03:33:58.355 --> 03:33:59.096
Thank you, Director Ruscha.

03:33:59.536 --> 03:34:01.598
Any further conversation on this amendment?

03:34:02.739 --> 03:34:03.439
Dr. Guzman.

03:34:03.459 --> 03:34:04.480
I will offer this last thing.

03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:07.123
And then we probably should go to a vote.

03:34:07.143 --> 03:34:16.911
But very simply put, we need to make sure that we are protecting the vulnerable.

03:34:17.414 --> 03:34:23.318
providing access to these housing units, even in the city and county of Denver's building codes is not clear.

03:34:23.378 --> 03:34:24.623
It's as clear as mud.

03:34:24.991 --> 03:34:31.138
There is reference to this, if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not necessarily required.

03:34:31.218 --> 03:34:39.988
We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to get licensed.

03:34:40.688 --> 03:34:49.378
And so to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units,

03:34:49.966 --> 03:34:52.289
I would like to see this in the policy.

03:34:52.810 --> 03:35:06.247
I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement that's established.

03:35:06.287 --> 03:35:12.295
And although it is established in other places, it is not established in our policy and we are the government of this region.

03:35:12.528 --> 03:35:18.478
And we should take it seriously that we have a due diligence and responsibility to those members of our community that would need this.

03:35:18.719 --> 03:35:18.999
Thank you.

03:35:20.242 --> 03:35:20.883
Director Harwick.

03:35:22.586 --> 03:35:26.773
I always have to follow you director Guzman, but I'm, you know, obviously I'm.

03:35:27.108 --> 03:35:39.502
any time that we can be supportive of our communities most in need, those suffering from a whole variety of disabilities, I want to be able to put our best foot forward there.

03:35:39.962 --> 03:35:51.355
And while we can't call out specific jurisdictions, if there is that chance that there is a jurisdiction that isn't meeting this requirement, then we should make sure we're getting there.

03:35:51.555 --> 03:35:57.081
And if in the process, the state comes up with something better or something in the future, that's okay.

03:35:57.061 --> 03:36:04.371
But I think that this is like a safety net in my mind about like how to really get there for this community and

03:36:06.562 --> 03:36:23.028
I think that also, as we're tying these developments, spur off around our transit, that's also giving them better access to the resources and giving them the life that they want and the freedom of movement that we so cherish.

03:36:23.048 --> 03:36:24.671
So I'm highly in support of this.

03:36:25.192 --> 03:36:25.913
Thank you.

03:36:25.933 --> 03:36:27.996
Secretary, less than 30 seconds.

03:36:27.976 --> 03:36:32.000
This question is for Chessie.

03:36:32.261 --> 03:36:40.169
My understanding with this language is that it applies to buildings with elevators in it.

03:36:40.269 --> 03:36:55.485
And so with single stair buildings, that there are different policies around equitable access because of the challenges, obviously, in a single stair building of getting people into the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth floor.

03:36:55.617 --> 03:36:58.543
You're probably the biggest expert on this in the room.

03:36:59.726 --> 03:37:11.010
Do you see any concerns with this language when it comes to buildings with stairs only versus elevators?

03:37:11.716 --> 03:37:21.428
I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable, I do know that equitable access and accessible units are different things and have different requirements.

03:37:22.249 --> 03:37:25.714
And so we're talking specifically about accessible units.

03:37:27.056 --> 03:37:33.284
We're also not, we're tending to be talking about larger buildings because we do want them to be dense at stations.

03:37:33.324 --> 03:37:37.689
So I think they're typically going to be elevator buildings, but I don't, I don't have any concerns about that.

03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.410
Thank you, Ms.

03:37:38.450 --> 03:37:38.731
Brady.

03:37:39.211 --> 03:37:40.693
Let's do the roll call vote.

03:37:40.792 --> 03:37:46.817
Again, this is the amendment offered by Director Guzman and Director Rusha, Treasurer Banker.

03:37:50.781 --> 03:37:51.401
Director Catlin.

03:37:52.883 --> 03:37:53.103
No.

03:37:54.244 --> 03:37:54.965
Director Geisinger.

03:37:56.186 --> 03:37:56.266

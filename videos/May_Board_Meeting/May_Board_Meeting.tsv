673.15	682.662	Troy Whitmore	Thank you for the presentation and the ease of absorbing the proposed changes. Erin,	
682.642	689.698	Erin Vallejos	It's definitely something I think we could assist with, but I do think there would still be	
692.125	698.693	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Director Catlin.	
699.354	706.863	Peggy Catlin	Thank you. And thank you for a very clear presentation. Although I have one question of	
707.824	713.07	Erin Vallejos	As the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the 3/4 of a mile boundary	
713.05	719.309	Peggy Catlin	That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later. Thank you.	
719.951	723.381	Julien Bouquet	OK. Secretary Nicholson.	
724.762	743.804	Chris Nicholson	Thank you very much. I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more	
743.824	749.47	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Secretary. Director Ruscha.	
750.496	758.554	Joyann Ruscha	Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I just wanted to offer a bit of context. And the General	
758.594	765.49	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director. Director Larsen.	
765.51	769.078	Matt Larsen	Thank you. I just have a question for Ms. Vallejos. So I seen one of these slides that it	
770.898	775.828	Erin Vallejos	No, that would be for the year, I believe. Let me--	
775.908	780.297	Matt Larsen	As of. OK. As of. So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year. That's it? And so I	
780.838	786.669	Erin Vallejos	And I-- go ahead, Debra. Oh.	
790.497	791.218	Debra Johnson	So if I can, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question. I would not	
792.025	802.662	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Any other Directors, comments? Yeah, Director Guzman.	
803.203	810.034	Michael Guzman	I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area. District C is fairly	
810.014	820.69	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director. Director Harwick.	
820.73	826.319	Ian Harwick	Well, thank you, Director Guzman. I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you	
828.141	830.144	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director Harwick. Ms. Johnson.	
831.246	831.667	Debra Johnson	Yes. Director Harwick, if I understood you correctly, because I'm taking copious notes	
832.167	833.89	Julien Bouquet	Thank you.	
833.95	834.391	Ian Harwick	Yeah, but I also want to keep the service areas the same as they are today. Yeah.	
835.332	837.455	Julien Bouquet	Excellent. Director Nicholson, then Director Ruscha.	
837.796	838.637	Chris Nicholson	Yeah, just a quick follow up onto that. When it comes to-- go to Director Ruscha. My	
839.765	844.551	Julien Bouquet	All right. Director Ruscha.	
845.433	857.93	Joyann Ruscha	Thank you for the Red Rover. I wasn't prepared. I went back to my notes. OK. So	
858.671	864.118	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director Ruscha. Director Nicholson.	
864.098	889.87	Chris Nicholson	Thank you. Is there any step during enrollment of AAR and AOD where we ask	
890.356	895.925	Erin Vallejos	I will have to find out about that as part of the process, and we will confirm if that is how	
896.466	904.859	Chris Nicholson	Yeah. So yeah, as a first thing, I would say that since we're going to be updating this	
907.082	907.723	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Secretary. Ms. Johnson.	
909.526	909.986	Debra Johnson	Yes, thank you very much, Director Nicholson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,	
910.127	916.273	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Director Larsen.	
916.633	919.376	Matt Larsen	Thank you. I was just kind of doing some stuff on my calculator. So if we only have 3,000	
920.657	935.652	Debra Johnson	First, if I may. Just for everyone's edification, probably you have heard this over the	
936.391	938.353	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director.	
938.373	943.198	Erin Vallejos	And I don't think I need to add anything. That was really exactly what I was going to say.	
944.199	953.249	Matt Larsen	Can I just follow up? But I mean, surely many more people than 3,000 in the metro area	
956.793	957.373	Erin Vallejos	Well, and again, we have continued to see substantial growth in the number of customers	
959.976	963.299	Julien Bouquet	Thank you.

1313.395	1322.188	Joyann Ruscha	OK. I did have a question, but also Treasurer Benker had her hand up, and it was her	
1322.528	1326.454	Julien Bouquet	Treasurer Benker?	
1327.395	1331.521	Karen Benker	I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic. So how can	
1331.882	1337.39	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Johnson.	
1337.79	1338.131	Debra Johnson	Yes, thank you very much. Director Benker, that question is better suited for me.	
1340.113	1341.175	Karen Benker	OK. But if I can--	
1342.505	1344.588	Julien Bouquet	Treasurer, yeah.	
1344.608	1345.409	Karen Benker	Some of the issues that you just raised are important. There's no doubt. However, I don't	
1346.351	1353.882	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Johnson.	
1356.365	1360.311	Debra Johnson	Thank you. There's a couple of external factors that play into that quite naturally. When	
1360.713	1369.686	Julien Bouquet	Director Ruscha.	
1370.127	1383.767	Joyann Ruscha	Thank you, sir. So I have a question for legal. So recognizing this has to be submitted	
1386.262	1398.596	Debra Johnson	I will address that question and then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound. I think if anything,	
1399.478	1404.624	Carl Green	Yes. Thank you so much, GM/CEO Johnson. Oh. Apologies. Apologies.	
1405.845	1416.117	Julien Bouquet	Sensitive microphone.	
1416.451	1430.934	Carl Green	Yes. Apologies. But to piggyback off of what GM/CEO Johnson has noted, I would couch	
1430.954	1432.637	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Director Ruscha? OK. Director Guissinger and then Director Larsen. Oh,	
1433.107	1446.549	Matt Larsen	Thank you. I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were	
1447.511	1454.081	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Ms. Johnson.	
1454.542	1459.35	Debra Johnson	Thank you very much. The one thing I would share, Director Larsen, is we look at the	
1460.579	1468.37	Julien Bouquet	Director Larsen.	
1469.371	1478.384	Matt Larsen	But it just seems like, when I was reading the documents, that there's always a legitimate	
1478.924	1481.608	Debra Johnson	I'm sorry. Thank you for the question. For me, I've only been here for five years, and I	
1482.128	1492.688	Carl Green	Yeah, I would just highlight, Chairman, if I may. Since January 2023, there was about 270	
1493.249	1496.014	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Director? OK. I had Director Harwick. And just as a reminder, we're	
1497.397	1500.643	Ian Harwick	Mine will be comments about this but also moving forward as well, because I am in support	
1501.028	1502.05	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director. Any further conversation on this amendment? Secretary	
1503.191	1508.7	Chris Nicholson	So this is for our deputy General Counsel. If we were to pass this tonight, what's the	
1509.621	1512.145	Julien Bouquet	In regards to the amendment, Secretary?	
1512.185	1518.295	Chris Nicholson	Yeah.	
1518.68	1543.557	Julien Bouquet	OK. Deputy Counsel.	
1544.566	1546.914	Melanie Snyder	There we go. Excuse me. Thank you, Director Nicholson. I don't have concerns.	
1547.255	1548.479	Julien Bouquet	Secretary.	
1548.499	1552.994	Chris Nicholson	That is all.	
1553.175	1553.476	Julien Bouquet	Yeah, Treasurer Benker.	
1554.058	1554.76	Karen Benker	Here is where I do not understand. In 2019, we had the service. My area, my district, as	
1555.443	1556.145	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Johnson.	
1557.138	1559.422	Debra Johnson	So thank you, Director Benker. What I'm going to say goes back to the previous	
1559.442	1561.746	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Director Guzman and then Director Guissinger.	
1561.766	1571.162	Michael Guzman	So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight, getting back to the motion	
1571.362	1572.564	Carl Green	Chair, OK for me?	
1572.645	1573.506	Julien Bouquet	Absolutely, Mr. Green.	
1574.167	1579.637	Carl Green	If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear, and if you	
1580.198	1582.842	Michael Guzman	Thank you. I would just urge a no vote, and let's move on to the policy.	
1583.395	1585.438	Julien Bouquet	All right. Director Guissinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this	
1585.558	1590.484	Lynn Guissinger	I'll be super quick. That last explanation that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of	
1590.504	1606.905	Julien Bouquet	Mr. Green.	
1607.408	1612.899	Carl Green	Yeah, that's a great follow up question. I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when	
1612.959	1624.101	Lynn Guissinger	Thank you.	
1625.009	1627.453	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. All right, let's do a roll call vote. As a reminder, it is the first amendment	
1627.613	1640.816	Karen Benker	Yes.	
1641.878	1650.072	Julien Bouquet	Director Buzek is gone. Director Catlin.	
1650.052	1677.561	Peggy Catlin	No.	
1677.541	1692.317	Julien Bouquet	Director Guissinger.	
1692.417	1699.605	Lynn Guissinger	No.	
1699.645	1700.906	Julien Bouquet	Director Gutschenritter.	
1700.946	1701.667	Chris Gutschenritter	No.	
1701.867	1702.028	Julien Bouquet	Director Guzman.	
1702.048	1702.468	Michael Guzman	No.	
1703.478	1721.897	Julien Bouquet	Director Harwick.	
1722.397	1723.178	Ian Harwick	No.	
1724.439	1725.06	Julien Bouquet	Director Larsen.	
1725.08	1729.144	Matt Larsen	No.	
1729.664	1731.967	Julien Bouquet	Director Nicholson.	
1731.987	1732.287	Chris Nicholson	Yes.	
1733.549	1735.493	Julien Bouquet	First Vice Chair O'Keefe.	
1737.036	1740.702	Patrick O'Keefe	No.	
1741.684	1749.058	Julien Bouquet	Director Paglieri.	
1750.341	1751.102	Brett Paglieri	No.	
1755.908	1757.11	Julien Bouquet	Director Ruscha.	
1757.171	1757.972	Joyann Ruscha	No.	
1757.992	1758.874	Julien Bouquet	Director Whitmore.	
1759.375	1759.796	Troy Whitmore	No.	
1759.816	1774.305	Julien Bouquet	I'm a yes, but the motion will fail. And we have 3 to 10. OK. Moving on. Yes, Director?	
1774.758	1792.084	Karen Benker	I would like to withdraw the next two amendments.	
1792.185	1795.129	Julien Bouquet	Next two amendments?	
1795.43	1799.337	Karen Benker	Yes.	
1799.678	1810.558	Julien Bouquet	OK. The next two amendments have been withdrawn.	
1810.958	1812.601	Chris Nicholson	They were never introduced, so they're not really withdrawn. But now you would	
1813.363	1818.552	Julien Bouquet	Excellent. Back to the main motion at hand. Director O'Keefe.	
1820.337	1832.897	Patrick O'Keefe	So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on this action. There's a few things going	
1833.277	1841.731	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director O'Keefe. Any further comments or questions on the main motion?	
1841.891	1843.233	Michael Guzman	I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously submitted a	
1843.393	1844.415	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director Guzman. Director Larsen.	
1844.856	1848.201	Matt Larsen	I'm going to be a no vote, I think it's kind of, like I said, we're constraining our freedom to	
1849.008	1853.458	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director Larsen. Secretary Nicholson.	
1855.102	1860.013	Chris Nicholson	So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session, and a town hall, all on	
1860.415	1864.88	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Any further comments on the main motion? OK. Seeing none, we had	
1865.961	1868.864	Karen Benker	No.	
1869.184	1888.164	Julien Bouquet	Director Catlin.	
1888.885	1889.325	Peggy Catlin	Yes.

1918.418	1937.892	Chris Gutschenritter	Yes.	
1938.445	1946.853	Julien Bouquet	Director Guzman.	
1947.013	1950.717	Michael Guzman	Yes.	
1951.117	1960.907	Julien Bouquet	Director Harwick.	
1960.927	1968.334	Ian Harwick	Yes.	
1969.023	1981.228	Julien Bouquet	Director Larsen.	
1981.869	1983.673	Matt Larsen	No.	
1984.396	1985.957	Julien Bouquet	Director Nicholson.	
1986.738	1992.203	Chris Nicholson	I'm in.	
1992.243	2001.11	Julien Bouquet	First Vice Chair O'Keefe.	
2001.751	2009.618	Patrick O'Keefe	Yes.	
2009.638	2013.441	Julien Bouquet	Director Paglieri.	
2013.691	2018.728	Brett Paglieri	Yes.	
2018.748	2019.671	Julien Bouquet	Director Ruscha.	
2019.691	2021.076	Joyann Ruscha	Yep.	
2022.28	2023.143	Julien Bouquet	Second Vice Chair Whitmore.	
2023.323	2024.046	Troy Whitmore	Yes.	
2025.431	2026.755	Julien Bouquet	I'm also a yes. So the motion, the main motion will pass 11, 2, and 2 absent. Yes. That	
2028.119	2042.977	Michael Guzman	So moved, Guzman.	
2042.997	2046.982	Julien Bouquet	Guzman is the mover. Do I have a second?	
2047.723	2053.911	Troy Whitmore	Second.	
2053.951	2055.072	Julien Bouquet	I have--	
2059.844	2062.427	Joyann Ruscha	Wait. Sir.	
2062.828	2067.734	Julien Bouquet	Yeah?	
2068.855	2069.075	Joyann Ruscha	Oh, wait. Well, I could be wrong. I'm sorry, I forgot we started late. I thought we hit our	
2069.155	2079.448	Julien Bouquet	Oh.	
2079.508	2087.978	Joyann Ruscha	Sorry.	
2088.228	2092.593	Julien Bouquet	Guzman is the mover. Whitmore is the second. Any discussion on it? Yeah, Director	
2092.653	2099.22	Brett Paglieri	I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting for this. I was not	
2099.34	2105.888	Julien Bouquet	Any further conversation? Secretary Nicholson.	
2105.908	2108.291	Chris Nicholson	Yeah, so I understand the importance of what we're doing here. I think that these	
2108.331	2117.661	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Johnson, is 51 million enough to make them not suck?	
2118.215	2134.3	Debra Johnson	Yeah. So thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you for the question.	
2134.28	2137.643	Julien Bouquet	My apologies. That was unprofessional.	
2137.723	2140.966	Debra Johnson	Keep it in mind, this is a budget transfer. And full transparency, Director Nicholson	
2140.986	2145.11	Chris Nicholson	24.	
2145.17	2147.712	Debra Johnson	How many?	
2148.033	2158.522	Chris Nicholson	24.	
2158.763	2159.744	Debra Johnson	23. I think I told you that earlier. So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this,	
2160.184	2162.346	Julien Bouquet	Secretary.	
2162.326	2175.021	Chris Nicholson	I really appreciate it and I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how	
2175.062	2177.104	Speaker	Yes. And what white.	
2177.284	2184.653	Julien Bouquet	Director Guzman.	
2185.374	2186.215	Michael Guzman	Just really quickly. With regards to this, moving this money from the unrestricted fund	
2186.315	2186.475	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director. Any further discussion on this item? All right. There is a no-- oh,	
2186.515	2186.856	Karen Benker	Yes.

2227.752	2228.193	Matt Larsen	Yes.

2327.677	2328.278	Julien Bouquet	OK. So that passes 12, 1, and 2. All right. Thank you, folks. So we have one--	
2328.781	2333.165	Jack Kroll	Chairman Bouquet, could you remind us over here? We missed who the mover and the	
2333.225	2338.851	Julien Bouquet	I had Guzman and Whitmore.	
2339.251	2340.633	Jack Kroll	OK. Thank you.	
2341.293	2342.214	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. OK. Excellent. Thank you all again for your patience. We do have one	
2342.234	2349.161	Michael Guzman	So moved, Guzman.	
2350.682	2355.447	Julien Bouquet	Guzman is the mover. Do we have a second?	
2355.865	2360.29	Ian Harwick	Second.	
2360.751	2367.62	Julien Bouquet	I have Harwick as the second. I do understand that on this item, we have some	
2370.763	2371.084	Chris Nicholson	Yes. I'd like to move to amend the ETOD policy. And I'm hoping that GM/CEO-- not	
2371.264	2371.584	Speaker	It's there.	
2372.385	2372.686	Chris Nicholson	Great. May I?	
2373.927	2375.389	Julien Bouquet	Would you like to read the motion and then we'll get a second?	
2377.632	2377.812	Chris Nicholson	Thank you. Yeah. So move to amend the policy such that Section 5 of the equitable	
2377.872	2378.613	Julien Bouquet	Excellent.	
2378.633	2380.636	Jack Kroll	Do we have a second?	
2380.676	2382.959	Julien Bouquet	And do we have a second on that?	
2383.419	2384.1	Ian Harwick	Second.	
2384.722	2385.824	Julien Bouquet	Harwick is the second. Secretary, would you like to discuss further?	
2385.864	2388.708	Chris Nicholson	Thank you. Yes. Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll	
2388.748	2391.733	Jack Kroll	Yes. So four of the written public comment items were submitted by individuals specifically	
2391.773	2394.156	Julien Bouquet	Perfect. Secretary.	
2394.677	2404.352	Chris Nicholson	Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Executive Manager Kroll. So here at RTD, we make	
2404.372	2404.732	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Director Harwick.	
2405.013	2405.313	Ian Harwick	Yeah. So I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD, that we're really	
2405.814	2406.395	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director Harwick. Any further discussion on this amendment? Director	
2406.795	2410.181	Joyann Ruscha	Mr. Chair, maybe you can help me here. So I had a comment, but I had a comment on	
2411.923	2412.063	Julien Bouquet	You know what? Why not? Let's give it a try.	
2412.103	2412.484	Joyann Ruscha	OK, thanks. I'm doing my best. So this morning, we got an email from staff that	
2412.785	2414.751	Julien Bouquet	Thank you. Thank you, Director Ruscha. Director Guzman.	
2414.811	2417.318	Michael Guzman	So ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee, and this is my	
2417.599	2419.706	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Brady. First off, thank you for your patience and greatly appreciate you sticking	
2420.006	2422.614	Chessy Brady	Of course.	
2422.634	2425.282	Julien Bouquet	You're recognized.	
2425.703	2426.305	Chessy Brady	Thank you. No, there is nothing that would stop us from doing that. As you say, the point	
2426.977	2427.678	Karen Benker	Thank you. One more quick thing. And Director Benker, Treasurer Benker, the sales	
2428.899	2429.22	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director. Director Paglieri.	
2429.3	2430.381	Brett Paglieri	Thank you. I'll be brief. I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply	
2430.421	2430.862	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director. Treasurer Benker.	
2431.823	2432.104	Karen Benker	Just a quick question. Some of the surplus properties that we're talking about, we are	
2432.384	2432.925	Chessy Brady	Thank you. So this policy is aimed at transit oriented development. So property that RTD	
2432.985	2435.268	Karen Benker	OK.	
2435.568	2441.716	Chessy Brady	Yes.	
2441.756	2445.201	Julien Bouquet	Secretary Nicholson.	
2445.761	2449.486	Chris Nicholson	I actually have some questions for Ms. Brady. So first off, Director Paglieri raised the	
2450.107	2452.27	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Brady.	
2452.29	2453.271	Chessy Brady	Sure, yes. Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means	
2454.213	2455.014	Julien Bouquet	Secretary.	
2455.054	2456.676	Chris Nicholson	So second question. I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as a discount. I was	
2456.716	2458.518	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Brady.	
2459.098	2460.2	Chessy Brady	Thank you. So affordable housing projects are notoriously difficult to finance. And I think	
2460.58	2461.281	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Ms. Brady. We're going to wrap up with Director O'Keefe and then Director	
2461.301	2461.981	Patrick O'Keefe	Oh, I thought I got last word. So I support this amendment. I think it is a reasonable	
2463.944	2466.386	Julien Bouquet	Director Larsen.	
2466.807	2467.467	Matt Larsen	Thank you. I'm going to be a no vote on this. I don't agree with our transit oriented	
2468.669	2476.217	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director Larsen. All right. With the indication there is a no vote, I am going	
2476.958	2483.545	Karen Benker	Yes.	
2483.66	2485.122	Julien Bouquet	Director Catlin.	
2485.823	2494.014	Peggy Catlin	Yes.	
2495.776	2507.071	Julien Bouquet	Director Guissinger.	
2507.212	2507.592	Lynn Guissinger	Yes.

2521.64	2524.204	Ian Harwick	Yes.	
2524.405	2526.829	Julien Bouquet	Director Larsen.	
2527.49	2529.714	Matt Larsen	No.	
2529.874	2532.219	Julien Bouquet	Secretary Nicholson.	
2533.24	2533.781	Chris Nicholson	Yes.	
2533.881	2535.104	Julien Bouquet	First Vice Chair O'Keefe.	
2536.166	2540.413	Patrick O'Keefe	Yes.	
2540.393	2563.279	Julien Bouquet	Director Paglieri.	
2563.259	2568.224	Brett Paglieri	Yes.	
2568.344	2570.247	Julien Bouquet	Director Ruscha.	
2570.287	2578.996	Joyann Ruscha	Sorry, no.	
2579.777	2583.24	Julien Bouquet	And finally, Second Vice Chair Whitmore.	
2584.282	2588.406	Troy Whitmore	Yes.	
2588.842	2593.869	Julien Bouquet	And I am a yes. That amendment will pass 10, 2-- excuse me. 10, 3, and 2. Yes. 10	
2594.69	2596.932	Joyann Ruscha	It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman, and I--	
2597.653	2608.167	Michael Guzman	I can make the motion. Sorry.	
2608.147	2611.492	Joyann Ruscha	I think he has the language in front of him.	
2612.253	2619.585	Julien Bouquet	Director Guzman.	
2620.186	2631.403	Michael Guzman	Thank you, Mr. Chair. We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end	
2631.383	2643.481	Jack Kroll	Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the	
2644.383	2653.016	Michael Guzman	Correct.	
2653.797	2654.097	Julien Bouquet	So the language we see, this would substitute the language? OK, perfect.	
2654.558	2655.94	Michael Guzman	Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get this done.	
2656.375	2659.039	Julien Bouquet	Director Ruscha.	
2659.46	2660.06	Joyann Ruscha	I was happy to speak to the motion, but I wasn't sure if we were-- I'm tired. Is that OK?	
2660.721	2661.623	Julien Bouquet	Mhm.	
2662.043	2663.886	Joyann Ruscha	OK.	
2663.926	2679.649	Julien Bouquet	We got Guzman as the mover and Ruscha as the second, and we're up for	
2679.629	2692.12	Joyann Ruscha	OK.	
2692.64	2694.002	Julien Bouquet	You're up, Director Ruscha.	
2694.183	2697.449	Joyann Ruscha	Thank you sir. OK. So just for everyone's edification, we struck the first sentence. It	
2697.489	2699.432	Julien Bouquet	Questions or comments on this amendment? Director Catlin, then Secretary	
2700.013	2702.718	Peggy Catlin	I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the first amendment that we	
2703.019	2705.283	Julien Bouquet	Yeah, Ms. Brady.	
2706.064	2714.479	Chessy Brady	Would you like me to comment? So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver	
2714.847	2720.033	Peggy Catlin	If I might? That's kind of my point. It seems a little bit redundant.	
2720.613	2725.799	Julien Bouquet	Secretary Nicholson.	
2726.54	2727.041	Chris Nicholson	I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's all right.	
2727.201	2728.362	Julien Bouquet	To the Amendment?	
2729.483	2735.99	Chris Nicholson	Thank you.	
2736.111	2738.273	Julien Bouquet	Just to clarify, that was a question. You would like to offer an amendment to the	
2738.607	2743.333	Chris Nicholson	Yes. Sub-amendment.	
2743.874	2757.713	Julien Bouquet	Mr. Kroll?	
2759.127	2766.416	Jack Kroll	Technically, the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy, and this is an	
2767.357	2772.243	Julien Bouquet	Rock on. Secretary.	
2772.263	2781.754	Chris Nicholson	Yeah. So at that point, I would say I'd have to be a no for the very simple reason.	
2782.315	2786.4	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Secretary. Treasurer Benker and then Director Ruscha.	
2786.752	2793.682	Karen Benker	Just real quick. Have you perhaps considered something more positive, saying	
2794.102	2801.893	Julien Bouquet	Director Ruscha or Director Guzman.	
2802.094	2815.813	Karen Benker	Again, sort of an amendment, but just a thought.	
2816.266	2822.801	Joyann Ruscha	So I just want to address what Secretary Nicholson said. I might have missed part of	
2823.462	2833.023	Julien Bouquet	Nicholson.	
2833.063	2833.785	Chris Nicholson	Thank you. And then I guess the only question I have for-- and this is actually for Ms.	
2834.288	2835.591	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Brady.	
2836.432	2837.234	Chessy Brady	Yes. In a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units-- and Director Ruscha	
2838.055	2845.43	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Ms. Brady. Secretary.	
2846.151	2850.299	Chris Nicholson	Yeah. Just, I guess for Director Ruscha or Director Guzman. Are there any	
2853.506	2854.187	Julien Bouquet	Either Directors.	
2855.568	2855.909	Joyann Ruscha	Yeah. I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate	
2856.249	2862.739	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Director Ruscha. Any further conversation on this amendment. Director	
2863.38	2874.977	Michael Guzman	I will offer this last thing, and then we probably should go to a vote. But very simply	
2875.801	2881.987	Julien Bouquet	Director Harwick.	
2882.388	2883.248	Ian Harwick	I always have to follow you, Director Guzman. But obviously, I'm very in support. Any time	
2883.589	2884.67	Julien Bouquet	Secretary, less than 30 seconds.	
2885.591	2886.812	Chris Nicholson	This question is for Chessy. My understanding with this language is that it applies to	
2886.832	2887.112	Julien Bouquet	Ms. Brady.	
2887.293	2888.314	Chessy Brady	I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable-- I do know	
2891.697	2895.521	Julien Bouquet	Thank you, Ms. Brady. Let's do the roll call vote. Again, this is the amendment offered	
2895.661	2897.102	Peggy Catlin	No.	
2901.767	2902.388	Julien Bouquet	Director Guissinger.	
2902.408	2904.029	Lynn Guissinger	Yes.	
2904.189	2905.791	Julien Bouquet	Director Gutschenritter.	
2908.319	2912.85	Chris Gutschenritter	Yes.	
2914.574	2914.955	Julien Bouquet	Director Guzman.

2943.755	2946.238	Chris Nicholson	Yes.	
2946.738	2947.219	Julien Bouquet	Director O'Keefe.	
2950.827	2953.209	Patrick O'Keefe	No.	
2953.229	2954.21	Julien Bouquet	Director Paglieri.	
2954.631	2961.557	Brett Paglieri	No.	
2962.037	2964.56	Julien Bouquet	Director Ruscha.	
2965.0	2968.223	Joyann Ruscha	Yes.	
2968.443	2970.265	Julien Bouquet	Director Whitmore.	
2970.365	2976.451	Troy Whitmore	Yes.	
2976.491	2978.272	Julien Bouquet	I'm also a yes. So that'll pass. 1, 2, 3, 4. I think I got 10 yeses, 3 nos, and 2 absent.	
2978.473	2978.893	Jack Kroll	There are 4 nos.	
2980.139	2984.505	Julien Bouquet	Excuse me, four nos. Thank you.	
2984.525	2998.385	Jack Kroll	So 9, 4, and 2.	
3000.308	3009.1	Julien Bouquet	9, 4 and 2. My apologies. We'll save that for the record. OK. Now moving on back to	
3009.451	3022.069	Karen Benker	Yes.	
3022.75	3033.045	Julien Bouquet	Director Catlin.

3251.439	3272.232	Speaker	Amen, buddy.	
3272.701	3276.885	Julien Bouquet	Director Guzman.	
3277.326	3288.898	Michael Guzman	I got one quick. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for approving the travel consideration	
3288.918	3293.543	Julien Bouquet	Secretary-- thank you, Director Guzman. Secretary Nicholson.	
3294.184	3301.071	Chris Nicholson	I just wanted to flag that this weekend is the reopening of Downtown Celebration on	
3303.194	3315.85	Julien Bouquet	Any other matters? OK. I got a quick one. It's only going to take 19 minutes. Just	
3317.092	3329.708	Chris Gutschenritter	Second.	
3330.228	3332.932	Julien Bouquet	And a second from Gutschenritter. You guys all have a lovely night. Thank you all for

3424.475	3429.942		So with that, I will yield the floor so we can move on to the rest of the matters that we have before.	
3429.962	3431.564		So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.	
3434.307	3436.089		Thank you, GMCO Johnson.	
3436.97	3439.834		Any comments or questions for GMCO Johnson?	
3443.003	3443.404		 Yeah.	
3448.41	3449.071		Very exciting.	
3449.411	3450.953		And Kelly, welcome to the team.	
3451.474	3451.834		Thank you.	
3454.658	3455.038		All right.	
3455.559	3456.28		Moving on.	
3456.3	3459.364		Uh, they, we're going to move on to unanimous consent.	
3459.764	3470.057		Uh, there are three items on the unanimous consent agenda listed under section 16 actions A through C. Those items are the security operations budget transfer.	
3470.273	3477.692		 The 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, and the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension for one year.	
3477.712	3485.532		I do understand that Director Banker would like to offer some amendments to Item B, the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update.	
3485.95	3491.237		 And such I will remove, I will move that to a recommended actions, actions, excuse me.	
3491.817	3500.728		If anyone else has a change to discussion on or questions about any of the remaining unanimous consent items, please feel free to advise the chair at this time.	
3501.109	3506.656		And I'll of course be happy to pull the item from unanimous consent for consideration under recommended action.	
3507.757	3508.498		Director Nicholson.	
3510.721	3513.484		The Allied Universal Security Contract, please pull that.	
3514.085	3514.185		Okay.	
3514.537	3520.383		 So item B will be removed and placed into recommended action.	
3521.444	3527.771		Excuse me, former item C, as I look in real time here, the Allied Universal Security.	
3527.971	3531.635		Are we okay with security operations, budget transfer?	
3536.08	3540.505		I would move to approve the remainder of the unanimous consent agenda.	
3540.885	3541.506		Second.	
3541.672	3544.635		 Okay, I have Whitmore and then Roush as the second.	
3545.636	3566.078		Okay, so this is item A for the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $3,845,437.10 between Operated Expenses Lines for Transit Security Services.	
3568.64	3571.223		Is there any no votes on that?	
3573.548	3573.848		 Okay.	
3575.47	3577.954		Seeing none, that item will pass 14-0-1.	
3577.974	3584.602		All right, now we're moving on to our recommended action items.	
3585.363	3591.471		And we're gonna have first on our list, the Allied Universal Security Surface Contract Extension for one year.	
3591.511	3594.295		Is there a motion?	
3595.296	3595.697		So moved.	
3596.117	3596.738		Okay, Nicholson.	
3598.135	3598.576		 In a second.	
3599.637	3600.077		And Russia.	
3601.8	3602.04		All right.	
3602.22	3602.941		Any discussion.	
3604.122	3604.723		Director Nicholson.	
3605.384	3605.564		Yeah.	
3605.584	3608.968		So I just have a quick question about this one that came from a constituent.	
3610.57	3617.759		How many people do we have working from working on our security side from Allied?	
3618.26	3622.906		And how many do we have from, you know, RTDPD right now?	
3623.727	3624.007		Thank you.	
3625.248	3625.389		Ms.	
3625.409	3625.729		Johnson.	
3626.333	3629.765		 Yes, I will yield the floor to Chief Martin Gano who can address that question.	
3629.805	3630.146		Thank you.	
3632.736	3633.458		Chief Martin Gano.	
3634.535	3637.481		 I am trying to figure out whether we're going to be hot chat for me.	
3638.322	3638.683		Yes.	
3638.703	3638.923		Yeah.	
3638.943	3644.214		So technically, in regards to how many ally personnel, it's an hourly contract.	
3644.554	3647.52		So you'd have to take the amount of the hours and obviously divided by 40.	
3648.181	3651.848		It roughly equates to the recommended action for next year.	
3651.868	3653.812		I think it's about 9100 hours.	
3653.872	3656.998		So roughly equates about 180 security officers.	
3656.978	3662.706		 Right now we currently have 87 on our staff in regards to post certified police officers.	
3663.046	3668.453		We have a couple in training and one in the academy who should be probably about 90 by the end of next month.	
3669.955	3670.796		Thank you, secretary.	
3673.76	3675.202		This is for GMCO Johnson.	
3676.023	3678.767		What are there any.	
3680.249	3684.837		 plans in place or is and please feel free to not answer this as we can't.	
3685.959	3692.07		But I know there's been a drawdown over the last few years in our reliance on allied security.	
3692.11	3698.882		Is there anything in this contract or in your planning around this contract or.	
3698.862	3713.822		 anything that can give us guidance on whether we expect that to continue after authorizing this, or are we expecting to stay at, you know, 90, 90 something hundred or 180 people over the next few years?	
3714.843	3715.084		Yes.	
3715.524	3716.806		Thank you very much for the question.	
3716.946	3720.972		As chief indicated, this is a contract extension and there's hours that are specified.	
3721.072	3726.439		Hence, in reference to the dollar amount that we have here, I would have to come back to the board.	
3726.824	3732.632		 as it relates to any type of authorization as we're doing now currently with this contract extension, if that were to be modified.	
3732.873	3750.197		So on this point in time, it would stay the same unless there's some extenuating circumstances whereby we go out for a solicitation and we're not able to ensure that we're meeting the timeline before, since that's why we're here now with the contract extension quite naturally in doing so.	
3750.278	3754.063		We have to ensure that we have the appropriate staffing levels.	
3754.398	3759.584		 So, I'm talking around and around in circles right now, but the answer would be no at this point in time.	
3761.165	3761.546		Secretary.	
3763.668	3764.729		Perfect.	
3765.17	3766.091		Second Vice Chair Whitmore.	
3767.172	3773.519		So, Chief, jog my memory on our goal for the end of the year for sworn officers.	
3773.599	3774.8		It's not 90, right?	
3774.82	3776.302		It's continuing to grow.	
3776.862	3777.503		Chief Morrigano.	
3777.601	3779.584		 Yeah, so we are budgeted for 150.	
3780.024	3782.667		We're still in the process of growing to those numbers.	
3784.31	3790.858		So obviously with applications, background checks, everything else, we're heading positively to that.	
3790.918	3792.88		We're putting in more in the academy here in June.	
3792.941	3795.404		We'll continue to get lateral transfers.	
3795.904	3799.829		I'm sorry, lateral applications from other agencies, officers of experience.	
3799.849	3802.713		So we're hoping to hit that 150 goal by the end of year.	
3802.733	3803.234		All right.	
3803.254	3803.955		Thank you very much.	
3803.975	3806.458		I did have the right memory up here.	
3806.538	3807.439		Thank you, Mr. Chair.	
3807.487	3809.028		 Absolutely.	
3809.128	3812.351		Any further, well, any further questions or discussions on this?	
3813.292	3813.853		Yeah, Director Riesha.	
3815.694	3816.035		Thank you, sir.	
3816.115	3837.274		So I just wanted to note in the in the past upon request, the agency has provided a breakdown of how many just like our security personnel from, you know, our city to contracted and even break down in terms of with our contracted Allied Force like	
3838.402	3843.989		 the ones that are authorized to have firearms versus not, and our mental health staff and stuff.	
3844.009	3850.296		So that's something that I think the agency, I'm sure the agency would be happy to provide like that breakdown chart.	
3850.376	3852.239		I think it's been a little over a year since we've had one.	
3852.719	3861.249		So I just wanted to offer that to those who are interested and just to piggyback on Secretary Nicholson's comments.	
3862.431	3862.711		Thank you.	
3863.372	3864.013		Thank you, Director.	
3866.335	3866.435		Okay.	
3866.456	3867.717		Any further comments or questions?	
3869.317	3870.118		 Okay, seeing none.	
3870.238	3872.161		So I did have, thank you, Chief.	
3872.962	3876.066		I did have Nicholson as the mover and Roush as the second.	
3876.566	3878.569		Are there any no votes on this item?	
3882.814	3886.739		Okay, seeing none, the item will pass 14-0-1 absent.	
3887.58	3891.866		We are hitting our two hour mark, so we are gonna take a break for our cart employee.	
3892.947	3896.151		Let's shoot to be back here at nine o'clock.	
3896.291	3897.012		Would that be enough time?	
3898.409	3898.749		 Nope.	
3898.77	3899.35		Okay.	
3899.37	3899.571		Okay.	
3899.591	3900.592		Let's do 905 then.	
3901.153	3901.714		Thank you.	
3901.734	3902.675		Thank you.	
3902.695	3927.69		We'll back at 905.	
3927.94	3954.935		 We've got it.	
3954.955	3955.215		We've got it.	
3955.235	3955.435		All right.	
3955.455	3955.736		There are two.	
3955.756	3955.956		All right.	
3957.809	3968.376		 not.	
3988.994	3990.536		 Yeah.	
3990.836	3991.277		Yeah.	
3991.377	4011.103		Yeah.	
4023.976	4025.038		 Yeah.	
4025.058	4027.322		Yeah.	
4027.943	4047.317		Yeah.	
4065.252	4070.622		 You know what it is.	
4111.996	4113.899		 Okay.	
4114.38	4115.702		But yeah.	
4117.064	4119.828		Yeah.	
4120.449	4139.86		I hear.	
4144.7	4172.057		 We had a tower backed up on Friday night.	
4172.408	4178.217		 And, uh, Senator, if you're in the hot quarter, so you know, it's not a big deal.	
4178.278	4183.626		So, but if my daughter's school, no, they're out there, like an ankle thing.	
4183.767	4185.169		I don't know.	
4186.591	4187.272		I don't know.	
4187.412	4188.294		I don't know.	
4188.314	4189.776		I don't know.	
4189.796	4191.94		I don't know.	
4192.18	4193.783		I don't know.	
4193.963	4195.065		I don't know.	
4195.125	4196.187		I don't know.	
4196.367	4197.589		I don't know.	
4212.25	4217.678		 Thank you.	
4219.941	4240.452		Thank you.	
4240.87	4258.963		 You do it.	
4317.247	4326.719		 We're out of time.	
4327.079	4334.428		We're out of time.	
4334.548	4345.802		We're out of time	
4356.532	4357.97		 I'm sorry.	
4391.024	4418.905		 Okay.	
4432.013	4452.233		 Thank you very much.	
4506.635	4507.924		 Yeah, we're gonna get started.	
4508.186	4511.43		Have you seen Jack?	
4546.814	4572.809		 All right, folks, we're at 906.	
4573.931	4575.032		We're going to get started.	
4579.433	4580.655		 Director Bouquet, how do you vote?	
4581.015	4581.536		I mean, yes.	
4585.262	4591.852		We have a quorum of me and Director Packillary and Director Nicholson and Director Harwick.	
4607.075	4607.415		All right.	
4607.581	4609.083		 Thank you everyone for your patience.	
4609.483	4612.807		We are now moving on to our next recommended action for tonight.	
4614.069	4626.664		And that is going to be the recommended action of the 2025-2028 Title VI program update to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.	
4627.165	4628.687		Do we have a motion?	
4629.768	4630.289		So moved.	
4630.849	4631.911		I have Catlin as the mover.	
4632.932	4633.633		Second, Guzman.	
4633.933	4635.495		Guzman is the second.	
4636.96	4641.367		 I do understand that Director Banker has two amendments she would like to offer on this item.	
4641.747	4644.271		Director Banker will take your amendments one at a time.	
4645.814	4647.777		What is your first amendment, Director Banker?	
4648.338	4649.159		Thank you very much.	
4649.86	4656.37		And I'm glad everybody is now, you know, second wind and we're ready to go on to our	
4657.244	4659.409		 I don't know, six or seventh hour of meeting.	
4660.371	4663.76		Actually, I will tell you I have three.	
4663.8	4665.043		We'll see how things go.	
4665.083	4666.165		They're short.	
4667.168	4669.674		The first one, well, let me give you a little bit of background.	
4669.774	4670.636		Okay.	
4670.656	4675.708		So the background is I met with my four cities back in February and March.	
4675.688	4680.192		 And of course, you meet with them and you say hi and you say, okay, what are your needs?	
4680.272	4681.093		What are your wants?	
4682.154	4691.943		I met with all of them and they all gave me a list of basically trying to restore service that was removed during the pandemic.	
4691.963	4702.533		And so, of course, as my job as director, I'm trying to work with our staff to try to get that service restored.	
4703.373	4703.974		And so,	
4705.726	4729.371		 One of my questions or issues is I am guessing that when the RTD Board had to make the hard decisions of how to cut service almost in half because of this highly unusual pandemic, perhaps some of these cuts were not done equally across all 15 districts.	
4729.587	4734.775		 Director Banker, I'm sorry to interrupt, just so that we keep in order, could we get a second on?	
4735.155	4736.838		Could you read the motion and then we get a second?	
4736.858	4750.378		Yes, the motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact from 10% to 20% as it relates to major service changes and consistent with the FTA circular 4702.1B.	
4752.02	4758.43		And I believe the version that will be voted on is actually the version that	
4759.0	4760.842		 Mr. Kroll put up for us.	
4761.924	4764.147		So that's, that's the language right there.	
4764.187	4771.517		The first motion is to move the move to amend the 2025, 2028 title six program update, such that the threshold for triggering either.	
4771.977	4780.088		Disappointed Burton or disparate in that fine late night, finding a rising from a major service change from 10% to 20%.	
4781.77	4782.591		Do I have a second?	
4783.072	4783.433		Second.	
4783.453	4785.575		Pagliari is the second.	
4786.457	4786.797		Thank you.	
4787.637	4794.125		 So just to continue a little bit more background and then we can start, I guess, the debate here.	
4795.066	4802.115		I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during the pandemic.	
4802.936	4817.475		And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations come out.	
4817.455	4832.292		 I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic and perhaps do it a little bit quicker and	
4833.605	4837.794		 and also try to make it not quite so difficult.	
4838.215	4849.538		So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the city and county of Broomfield, and their transportation staff went through	
4849.518	4857.468		 our items quite closely and they sent us all a letter with recommended changes.	
4858.209	4868.021		So I've gone through with their changes and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the board, see what your thoughts are.	
4868.642	4871.225		You know, hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see what happens.	
4871.666	4877.533		But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that	
4877.513	4886.844		 the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large transit agencies.	
4887.525	4892.992		And so I did send you also a copy of the city and county of Broomfields letter just to refresh your memory.	
4893.993	4901.162		And so I would like to put forth that the first amendment would be changing the threshold from 10% to 20%.	
4901.182	4902.663		Thank you, Treasurer Baker.	
4902.804	4905.647		So again, the discussion right now is on the motion	
4906.319	4908.643		 This first motion, the first amendment.	
4908.984	4909.805		Director Catlin.	
4913.411	4914.313		Thank you, Mr. Chair.	
4914.934	4917.759		I'd like to ask GM CEO Johnson.	
4918.54	4931.422		I heard from someone I don't remember now because it's getting late, but someone said that some of those assumptions made by City and County Broomfield were incorrect.	
4931.482	4931.622		Ms.	
4931.662	4932.023		Johnson.	
4932.307	4933.428		 Yes, thank you very much.	
4934.129	4952.606		Relative to the comments that were made, and thank you very much, Director Catlin, as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned being part of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in Greater Seattle and then Chicago Transit Authority.	
4954.388	4959.192		That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there,	
4959.661	4963.024		 This is not correct relative to where we sit.	
4963.485	4970.932		And more specifically, I do know our director of civil rights when we were going through this quite naturally in the role that he is in.	
4970.993	4976.018		He and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies.	
4976.038	4981.363		So that's the communique that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving this information.	
4981.603	4986.208		So Mr. Green, if you want to just expound succinctly and briefly.	
4986.661	4992.248		 Yes, thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson, to expand upon the response.	
4992.288	5001.74		I just also want to ground us in first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes.	
5002.381	5009.53		And in doing that audit, we looked at 22, rather 23 different organizations, which includes the four.	
5009.51	5013.695		 Marta, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority.	
5014.235	5025.428		And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right?	
5025.629	5027.571		And ours is stacked in the middle.	
5027.611	5029.533		So I want to give you some numbers here.	
5030.294	5032.817		So for the four that I just mentioned,	
5033.911	5042.602		 Marta has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%.	
5043.623	5054.637		And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, six out of that 23 have 5% or less, two have 8%,	
5054.971	5063.929		 six, which includes us, or seven, including us, is at 10%, three at 15%, and then three at 20%.	
5064.15	5070.803		And in my over eight years of doing this work, and I'll just say that	
5070.783	5082.882		 When you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve, specifically with Title VI.	
5083.463	5089.112		Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service.	
5089.818	5097.146		 There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth.	
5097.666	5109.138		This is just a mechanism for the agency, such as RTD and the board of directors, so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant.	
5109.158	5117.327		So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.	
5119.349	5121.713		 I've director Ruchin next.	
5126.58	5131.227		Um, I did have a question, but I also, um, treasure banker had her hand up and it was her motion.	
5131.327	5133.611		So I'm happy to, to wait if that was in response.	
5134.392	5134.973		Treasure banker.	
5136.335	5142.264		Um, I, I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic.	
5143.225	5146.47		So how can we restore	
5147.75	5152.399		 let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several years ago.	
5152.84	5160.654		How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had that service?	
5161.536	5164.662		And so now we're being told	
5164.642	5173.772		 that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to have it.	
5174.934	5182.062		And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to pre-pandemic levels?	
5183.403	5183.564		Ms.	
5183.584	5183.964		Johnson.	
5184.264	5185.886		Yes, thank you very much, Director Banker.	
5185.926	5187.508		That question is better suited for me.	
5187.548	5191.813		Relative to the service delivery framework that we have,	
5192.097	5210.798		 While Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy service is based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours, but more specifically at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP.	
5211.439	5217.666		When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were.	
5218.321	5220.785		 85% of what service levels were in 2019.	
5221.546	5230.721		We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward.	
5231.783	5236.971		What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious	
5237.39	5241.798		 and how we're applying service because we do want to ensure there's equity.	
5241.838	5248.37		I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well.	
5248.811	5259.33		As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change.	
5259.665	5282.415		 That is up to the board quite naturally, but I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service keeping in mind that all transit agencies across, you know, the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power.	
5283.138	5288.485		 Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio.	
5288.585	5298.579		What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio.	
5298.92	5306.25		We've deviated from that and have a waiver and we're right sizing the fleet as we move forward.	
5306.29	5312.318		So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory or were.	
5312.5	5313.942		 And we're coming back from that.	
5314.924	5327.185		We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area from an origin and destination vantage point just by virtue of how our service area is going forward.	
5327.686	5331.032		So I'm not providing this to say I don't.	
5331.012	5333.254		 understand what you're trying to do.	
5333.275	5338.961		And as I share it with you, I do clearly and we want to work within the frameworks that we have.	
5339.602	5345.428		But a whole cell of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible.	
5345.508	5353.577		And I say it from the vantage point of, we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour.	
5354.03	5355.552		 but that was out on the street.	
5355.852	5359.316		Does that really yield the return on investment going forward?	
5359.416	5366.965		Hence, that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services going forward.	
5367.386	5368.847		Okay, but if I can.	
5368.988	5370.93		Treasure, yeah.	
5371.01	5375.015		Some of the issues that you just raised are important.	
5375.195	5375.816		There's no doubt.	
5376.156	5380.421		However, I don't believe it goes to the equity calculation.	
5382.884	5383.024		I	
5385.08	5400.76		 What I think is important to to hear from staff and I know we're going to be talking about this in our retreat, which is I'm looking forward to that is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in three years.	
5401.432	5420.994		 what barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110, and start quickly, or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher service levels.	
5422.957	5423.117		Ms.	
5423.157	5423.497		Johnson.	
5423.778	5424.178		Thank you.	
5424.198	5427.642		There's a couple of external factors that play into that.	
5427.993	5434.926		 quite naturally when we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate and the lack of people commuting in.	
5435.427	5447.309		It's important to keep in mind that there was, I'm forgetting the name, but the city and county of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the occupancy levels.	
5447.57	5451.537		But more specifically, what's important to note is that	
5451.517	5456.726		 there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to this central business district.	
5457.949	5468.388		I believe the last time I looked at stats, city and county at Denver was in the bottom three out of out of 50 major cities.	
5468.828	5472.495		And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number	
5474.078	5478.923		 is the third state relative to remote work and then City of Boulder is number one.	
5479.344	5487.092		While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic.	
5487.452	5496.882		How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before?	
5497.563	5501.487		I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward	
5501.838	5525.374		 relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery.	
5525.894	5528.959		And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power,	
5529.26	5553.588		 we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available where people whereby were working extra shifts and then we didn't have enough people for daily pullout on those other routes.	
5554.009	5557.613		And so I'm providing that context to say	
5557.93	5577.93		 to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do, but to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of this agency's.	
5580.02	5580.44		 Thanks, sir.	
5580.48	5583.864		So I have a question for legal.	
5585.285	5595.475		So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I want to be careful of my words.	
5597.297	5608.187		Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public comment process or	
5608.741	5613.908		 Is that something that we, I guess, I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area.	
5613.988	5616.131		And I wanted to get a bit of feedback on that.	
5616.591	5621.217		Now, to disparage the motion, I just also want to understand the potential legal implications.	
5626.324	5628.687		I will address that question.	
5629.228	5631.891		And then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound.	
5631.991	5635.035		I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement,	
5635.606	5659.386		 and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference of public perception.	
5659.855	5665.784		 There is leeway relative to the circular in light of what can be done.	
5665.864	5678.945		We are sitting here on May 28th, recognizing that we have a new administration and that we do need to have a Title VI program that's submitted and we have been engaged on this topic since January.	
5679.406	5682.03		That's not to negate any amendments or anything like that.	
5682.11	5684.614		I am just trying to answer the question.	
5684.797	5691.965		 But more specifically, Mr. Green, since you are very well-versed in 4702.1B, I would yield the floor to you.	
5692.025	5696.069		And that's the citation for the FTA circular that we're talking about.	
5696.509	5696.69		Yes.	
5696.75	5698.872		Thank you so much, GM CEO Johnson.	
5698.932	5700.133		You.	
5704.538	5706.94		Apology, the positive microphone.	
5707.221	5707.521		Yes.	
5707.881	5708.322		Apologies.	
5708.382	5712.306		But to piggyback off what GM CEO Johnson has noted,	
5713.332	5720.373		 That is, I would couch that as the bigger risk is when we think about establishing policy, right?	
5720.433	5725.047		As it relates to 4702.1B, the FTA Title VI circular.	
5725.432	5734.847		 it does call upon the agency to do a lot of outreach and public involvement to ensure that we are collecting that feedback to inform decisions.	
5735.408	5748.79		So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as the policy.	
5749.495	5753.62		 So, but with respect to the circular, we can, i.e.	
5753.94	5757.885		the board of directors could adopt a different threshold.	
5757.905	5771.001		So for example, the one that director banker has put forth, although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update.	
5771.761	5779.03		There is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the board is ultimately approving the policy.	
5780.917	5781.318		 Thank you.	
5782.179	5786.085		Director Gysinger and then Director Larson.	
5789.69	5791.212		Director Larson and then Harwick.	
5793.395	5793.816		Thank you.	
5795.378	5810.4		I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were for service changes, this Title VI analysis that were in the	
5810.583	5833.095		 the board packet, and it seemed like most of the time we, you know, sometimes there was a little bit of disparate impact on one route or the other, but mostly it sort of ended up that in the aggregate there wasn't really much, and there were legitimate justifications for what there was on an individual basis.	
5833.896	5838.042		I guess my, you know, my basic question is with	
5838.393	5846.48		 with regard to this update and the changes that we're proposing, are we just, I mean, is there really a problem here?	
5846.5	5848.682		Are we just making this harder for ourselves?	
5848.742	5859.872		Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact one place or the other.	
5859.933	5863.716		We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons.	
5864.677	5868.18		And on balance, they don't really seem to	
5868.785	5881.669		 under our current setup, you know, ever, ever sort of look like they were, you know, there were somehow some, you know, bad intent or just inattention to who we're serving.	
5881.729	5887.84		It seems like we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have done anyways.	
5888.208	5908.974		 Why put sort of a greater burden, sort of regulate ourselves more than we have to, and why not just give us the freedom to operate as we would as much as we can, given that we don't, you know, it doesn't necessarily seem like it's been a problem for a long time, at least from what I could see.	
5909.014	5917.405		I mean, there weren't that many Title VI complaints that I could, that I, in the information that was provided.	
5917.874	5918.256		 I don't know.	
5919.442	5922.537		My basic question is why would we make things harder for ourselves?	
5922.898	5923.14		Thanks.	
5924.908	5925.793		Thank you, Ms.	
5925.833	5926.315		Johnson.	
5927.78	5928.401		 Thank you very much.	
5928.461	5945.298		The one thing I would share Director Larson, as we look at the modification that's been put forward for your consideration, like a 36 month period, as we're adding back service, there could be unforeseen consequences as we do them in a segmented fashion.	
5945.618	5955.188		And so that's one element as a whole, because if we're making modifications going forward, there could be an adverse impact.	
5955.488	5957.911		 And so that's what I would showcase there.	
5958.692	5970.728		Keeping in mind to the point that you raised, when we talk about the aspect of DIDB, it's what can we do as an agency to help mitigate that to your point going forward.	
5970.949	5980.301		But it's just to ensure that we have a program whereby we are not causing undue harm to certain population segments.	
5982.764	5983.285		Director Larson.	
5985.307	5993.215		 But it just seems like when I was reading the documents that there, we, there's always a legitimate to justification for, for everything we want to do.	
5993.235	6001.124		Or we, you know, it's always, there's always this, we'll have a disparate impact, but we have a legitimate justification for, for doing this.	
6001.204	6002.425		So we're, we're just going to do it.	
6002.966	6011.955		I mean, how many times, how many times in the last however many years has it been that we did this analysis, we looked at all the service changes we wanted to do.	
6012.323	6016.77		 And we were like, okay, no, we're not going to do this list of service changes.	
6016.81	6023.039		We're going to, you know, cross out these ones because the aggregate impact is too much.	
6023.64	6025.843		I mean, is it, is it, is that happened?	
6026.043	6032.733		I just didn't, from what I read in the packet, I didn't, I don't know if I caught everything, but it didn't seem like there were a lot of those.	
6032.994	6041.807		Or is this happening kind of at an earlier stage where when Bob in service says, let's just send a bunch of buses to Cherry Hills Village, somebody says, no, no.	
6042.04	6046.365		 That's not going to work out before it even gets to this point.	
6047.566	6047.847		You know?	
6050.269	6050.75		I'm sorry.	
6051.491	6052.492		Thank you for the question.	
6052.532	6053.613		It's for me.	
6053.753	6059.179		I've only been here for five years and I came in the height of the pandemic and we've been adding back service and not.	
6059.56	6069.651		So that's difficult for me to answer just because we have not been in a situation whereby	
6070.357	6071.459		 It's been the opposite.	
6072.12	6074.403		Carl, do you have anything to add?	
6075.004	6075.405		Yeah.	
6075.425	6076.927		I would just highlight chair bouquet.	
6076.947	6094.153		If I may, since January 2023, there was about 270 service change recommendations that have been implemented and roughly 26, 24, 26 of those 276 were considered major service changes.	
6094.657	6101.608		 And out of that 26 to director Larson's point, there has been 13 potential disparate impacts.	
6102.449	6106.555		And to your point, there was a substantial legitimate justification.	
6106.575	6116.631		And going it's, I wouldn't necessarily couch it as an exercise, but I would say we were the transit equity office within within the civil rights division.	
6116.881	6121.415		 works hand in glove with Jesse Carter and his team service development.	
6122.177	6129.861		And as we are having those conversations after the service change recommendation are put forth and we analyze it if there is a potential disparate impact.	
6130.212	6135.922		 More often than not, to your point, and to my earlier, earlier point, that Title VI is not a stopping mechanism.	
6136.443	6147.202		And I wouldn't necessarily state that it's burdensome because it's one of our responsibilities to make sure that we are equitably distributing services across our service area.	
6147.863	6155.376		But more often not, there is a legitimate justification to put forth the service recommendation as it is presented to the board.	
6158.073	6158.474		 Thank you.	
6159.576	6159.837		Director.	
6162.021	6162.121		Okay.	
6162.142	6168.515		Uh, I had director Harwick and just as a reminder, we're currently in discussion regarding this first motion.	
6168.595	6173.044		Just want to make sure that, um, first amendment, excuse me, first amendment.	
6173.064	6176.572		So make sure, uh, comments are around that.	
6177.033	6177.634		Director Harwick.	
6179.369	6190.03		 Mine will be comments about this, but also moving forward as well, because I am in support of this, this title six, not, not the amendment, just as just a straight title six.	
6190.05	6195.741		Um, you know, I, I don't think moving, uh, from, from 10 or from.	
6195.721	6201.028		 from 10% to 20% is going to increase ridership.	
6201.248	6211.441		I think that right now it allows our staff the ability to really center equity and effectively protect our communities.	
6211.521	6218.269		And while I get that Broomfield feels like they want more service, I don't think this is going to get it there.	
6218.907	6223.928		 I think this is the 11th hour and I think that it's really imperative that our staff has worked extremely hard on this.	
6223.948	6229.39		They've had to jump through a whole variety of hoops.	
6230.095	6255.293		 bunch of different board members and I think that we're here, they've done an incredible job and I think that this is, they are the subject matter experts and it's our opportunity here to put our trust in them, our belief in them and I think that we owe them that and we have been talking about this since January so we're well into four months and I think that it is key that we support this	
6255.273	6264.211		 Title six as is and we allow them to move forward and we allow them to start you know handing us off to the feds and we can move forward and That's where I'm at.	
6264.331	6264.612		Thank you.	
6264.972	6274.952		Thank you director any further conversation on this amendment Secretary Nicholson So this is for our deputy general counsel	
6275.388	6287.544		 If we were to pass this tonight, what's the legal risk to the agency when it comes to our federal Title VI approval as a result of this change?	
6287.704	6300.101		Like, is this gonna have any, would this have any legal repercussions or could we just, do we feel pretty comfortable that we could do this and not have the federal government take issue with it?	
6301.482	6303.385		In regards to the amendment secretary?	
6303.405	6303.505		Yeah.	
6306.91	6307.491		 deputy counsel.	
6311.415	6311.755		There we go.	
6311.775	6312.255		Excuse me.	
6312.816	6314.177		Uh, thank you, director Nicholson.	
6314.738	6316.019		Um, I, I don't have concerns.	
6318.922	6319.323		Secretary.	
6321.165	6321.725		That is all.	
6322.806	6323.907		Uh, yeah, treasure banker.	
6325.389	6333.357		Um, here is where I do not understand in 2019.	
6335.716	6337.201		 We had the service.	
6338.506	6342.902		My area, my district as many others have grown.	
6342.962	6346.013		There's no	
6347.208	6355.277		 For example, the town of Erie, just a few years ago was 20,000, now it's 40,000, like two, three years later.	
6355.297	6363.345		And when I met with Erie, they said, hey, we're planning going to 80,000 in just the next couple of years.	
6364.086	6374.717		I also read in the Denver Post that the town of Erie is the 15th fastest city in the country in terms of population growth.	
6375.727	6391.322		 So my question is, is if we had the service prior to the pandemic and it was serving all of these communities, why is it so difficult to get that restored?	
6395.466	6396.086		Just Johnson.	
6399.77	6402.392		So thank you, Director Banker.	
6404.667	6424.808		 This, what I'm going to say goes back to the previous comments that I had before, recognizing that RTD is a regional service and the way the service was outlined for all intents and purposes was bringing individuals into the central business district.	
6427.27	6432.936		That level of ridership isn't there and that's not to negate that there	
6433.844	6439.258		 is some elements centered on a need to move people to and fro.	
6439.318	6443.047		Hence, that's why there was the advent of the partnership program.	
6443.388	6450.486		And one of the reasons why Erie basically wanted to join the district because they were looking to put forward an application	
6450.837	6476.018		 for the partnership program, and I know you're just using that as an example, but just wanted to further iterate that because for all intents and purposes, as we're looking to provide mobility options, the intent behind the partnership program was more or less like a pilot in the sense that let's see how many people are utilizing this means of connection	
6476.656	6488.651		 prior to putting out a 40 foot or a 60 foot Arctic that costs more money per revenue hour and doesn't yield the same return on investment relative to the cost per boarding.	
6490.253	6493.037		Does that help or did I complicated more?	
6493.077	6496.661		Okay.	
6496.682	6497.082		Thank you.	
6497.222	6499.105		Director Guzman and then Director Geisinger.	
6499.846	6503.791		So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight.	
6504.191	6506.494		I'm getting back to the motion before us.	
6506.997	6519.312		 I would like to ask one question, which is the 10 to 20% is still not going to prevent us from adding services.	
6520.293	6535.232		It is simply a filter through which to look, if I understand this correctly, that we are not unintentionally harming community with protected status under the Title VI legislation,	
6535.634	6542.843		 or those that might be disproportionately burdened or impacted by their financial and economic status within the region.	
6543.964	6556.219		The only purpose we need to pass this is because it is due, because it is the law, and it is how we ensure that we are able to receive our federal funding, which is approximately 25% of our total budget.	
6557.4	6560.764		So I just want to make sure I understand.	
6560.98	6565.827		 what has been presented here does not tell the board no, we cannot provide transit service.	
6566.608	6586.195		It is simply a way to look at it and say we may have an issue if it reaches a certain threshold that we need to be aware of in order to be able to approve changes in service, fair changes or other changes that would create a potential burden on specific	
6587.137	6590.501		 communities as defined within the Title VI language.	
6590.701	6595.027		Is that correct or am I completely lost in this conversation?	
6596.849	6597.59		Chair, are we okay for me?	
6597.97	6599.031		Absolutely, Mr. Green.	
6599.051	6603.136		If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear.	
6603.196	6605.88		And if you have any double back, then I'll respond to it.	
6606.5	6612.047		So the current 10%, so if we think about different thresholds for DIDB,	
6612.77	6641.983		 And we are in, based off the desk audit, we're in the middle tier of having a threshold that allows us as an agency, which ultimately each service equity analysis is approved by the board of directors, where it allows us, again, to your point, when we're thinking about BIPOC or Black Indigenous people of color, for disparate impact or loan communities, for disproportionate burden, it allows us to make a well-informed, eyes-wide open decision	
6642.402	6646.948		 of better understanding of who's more likely to receive more of the impact.	
6647.469	6656.02		And when we're thinking about service increases, we're thinking about the fair share of benefits, where if there is a service reduction, we're looking at who's more likely to receive more of the burden.	
6656.54	6666.173		So to your point, Director Guzman, it allows us to just get a better understanding of the level of impact that we can have on a particular community.	
6666.594	6669.237		It does not prevent us from moving forward.	
6671.191	6671.612		 Thank you.	
6671.632	6678.953		I would just urge a no vote and let's move on to the policy.	
6679.856	6680.317		All right.	
6681.139	6685.993		Dr. Geisinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this specific amendment.	
6686.227	6687.389		 I'll be super quick.	
6687.409	6693.637		At that last explanation that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of just giving us a better holistic view.	
6693.657	6701.487		But I shared Director Larson's sort of view of are we just making this harder for ourselves, creating more work?	
6703.23	6704.051		Is that not right?	
6705.593	6706.534		Mr. Green?	
6706.554	6708.276		Yeah, that's a great follow up question.	
6708.296	6709.618		I would say it	
6710.847	6738.711		 I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when we think about what we're ultimately trying to achieve and a percentage that's mathematically consistent relative to the populations that we serve, so in doing this work, given my background, right, in doing an assessment of whether if we, and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is	
6738.978	6750.132		 with doing this work, or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyses, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything.	
6751.393	6762.066		And that's a disservice when we think about our populations within our service area, specifically as we look at our census data where 38.1% is BIPOC, 13.1%.	
6762.653	6765.596		 or 14.1 rather for low income, right?	
6765.716	6769.96		And then if we look at the onboard survey, 56% are considered BIPOC.	
6770.981	6791.8		And so I say all that to say, just to wrap it up, is that 10% threshold for DINDB allows us to make an informed decision that is backed by not only our desk audit, but the years of experience and knowing, having a better understanding of ultimately what we're trying to achieve.	
6794.345	6794.765		 Thank you.	
6795.086	6795.406		Thank you.	
6795.927	6797.628		All right, let's do a roll call vote.	
6797.648	6807.759		As a reminder, it is the First Amendment being introduced, as you all can see on that screen, with Director Banker as the mover and Director Pagulieri as the second.	
6807.859	6810.541		Again, we're voting on this First Amendment.	
6811.342	6811.923		Treasure Banker.	
6812.784	6813.004		Yes.	
6813.825	6814.926		Director Buzik is gone.	
6814.966	6816.387		Director Katlin.	
6818.009	6819.03		No.	
6819.05	6820.271		Director Geisinger.	
6822.874	6822.934		No.	
6824.348	6824.729		 Director.	
6824.849	6825.169		No.	
6825.189	6825.329		No.	
6826.051	6827.092		No.	
6827.112	6827.332		No.	
6827.413	6827.753		No.	
6828.174	6828.935		No.	
6828.955	6829.135		No.	
6829.656	6829.856		No.	
6830.637	6830.838		No.	
6831.138	6831.258		No.	
6831.999	6832.22		No.	
6833.321	6833.562		No.	
6833.622	6837.628		No.	
6841.073	6842.916		No.	
6844.458	6847.302		No.	
6848.344	6850.507		No.	
6850.708	6850.848		No.	
6851.389	6851.689		No.	
6854.048	6855.471		 I mean, yes, but the motion will fail.	
6856.953	6860.099		And we have three to 10.	
6861.342	6862.965		Okay.	
6862.985	6863.466		Moving on.	
6863.726	6864.307		Yes, Director.	
6864.347	6866.491		I would like to withdraw the next two amendments.	
6866.912	6867.614		Next two amendments.	
6867.754	6867.954		Yes.	
6868.635	6869.617		Okay.	
6869.637	6872.142		The next two amendments have been withdrawn.	
6873.522	6875.067		 Okay, they were never introduced.	
6875.107	6881.829		So they're not really with John, but now you would return back to the debate on the main motion, which is to approve the title six program update.	
6882.251	6882.632		Excellent.	
6883.174	6884.418		Back to the main motion at hand.	
6885.0	6885.642		Director Keith.	
6887.174	6894.424		 So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on this action.	
6894.484	6897.207		There's a few things going on.	
6897.247	6900.412		First of all, it should never get to the last minute.	
6900.932	6906.099		The board should never be asked to pass things because it's due in two days.	
6906.42	6912.608		And I know there's a lot of things that go into the delay, but that's just not the right	
6913.077	6919.51		 That's not the right urgency to place on the board act.	
6919.81	6926.884		Secondly, I don't know very much about this topic and I have sat in on two operations committee meetings.	
6928.327	6929.55		I've talked to a bunch of people.	
6929.61	6932.335		I've done my own research.	
6932.315	6937.602		 And I still am looking for a succinct description of the program.	
6937.642	6943.23		I would note that there was a wonderful book written by Robert Carrow.	
6943.25	6944.372		It's called The Power Broker.	
6944.612	6946.855		I'm sure a lot of people in this room know it.	
6947.596	6954.205		Talks a lot about bad policy decisions on disadvantaged communities.	
6954.185	6962.324		 and how those decisions were made and the harmful outcome of those decisions.	
6963.767	6968.278		It is 15 pages shorter than our packet tonight.	
6968.731	6978.289		 He won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1200 page treatise on impact by public infrastructure.	
6978.309	6985.423		I would request that when we're passing along documents as part of a packet,	
6985.403	6990.088		 it needs to have a point and it should be summarized from the committee for the rest of the board.	
6990.148	6995.373		Simply passing things along for us does not help me understand this better.	
6995.393	7002.58		I'm probably a yes vote tonight, but I was a no vote until about an hour and a half ago.	
7002.64	7012.17		And so I just, when you are putting together packets on complex questions for the board,	
7012.15	7016.376		 Given us reams of paper does not help us get to a better decision.	
7017.097	7029.856		So that's something request for the two three ish committee chairs As you're putting together topics like this and that would be very helpful for me to make better Decisions.	
7030.437	7030.697		Thanks.	
7031.018	7031.719		Thank you director.	
7031.839	7034.703		Okay any further comments or questions on the main motion?	
7035.765	7040.892		Dr. Guzman, I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously	
7041.496	7047.163		 submitted a proclamation for RTD on May 19th, 2025.	
7047.263	7048.845		It is in the director's emails.	
7049.506	7066.086		It was sent over by city council that they wholeheartedly support the 2025, 2028 title six program to include the proposed updates to major service change, disparate impact and fair equity policies, as well as updates to RTD's public participation plan and language access plan, which we are voting on now.	
7066.808	7071.073		 and that the clerk and recorder of the city and county of Denver did affix the seal making it official.	
7072.275	7074.017		I believe that that is necessary.	
7074.037	7092.681		There's a whole proclamation, you can read through it, but former board director Lewis, sorry, we had two Lewises and I wanted to make sure I said it right, did work with city council member Serena Gutierrez Gonzalez and	
7093.285	7097.534		 The unanimity of that vote is remarkable from our city council.	
7097.634	7101.081		So they stand behind this as well with us to move this forward.	
7101.101	7102.063		Thank you.	
7102.083	7102.905		Thank you, director.	
7103.687	7104.388		Director Larson.	
7106.312	7107.374		I'm going to be a no vote.	
7107.815	7109.218		I think.	
7109.738	7113.864		 I think it's kind of like I said, we're constraining our freedom to operate.	
7113.924	7116.928		We're spending a lot of energy and effort to track this.	
7117.308	7131.007		And I know the intentions behind that are good, but I think just as a matter of principle, we shouldn't be sort of trying to over, or regulating ourselves more.	
7131.428	7134.632		We should be thinking is, we have not,	
7134.612	7147.17		 There's not really a lot of evidence that we have disparately ever had any recent plans to expand service or decrease service in a way that	
7147.623	7152.349		 that causes a disparate impact on these populations.	
7152.77	7171.133		And I honestly believe that if we focused 100% just on increasing ridership, which is what I think we should be doing, and not trying to expand our sort of purview about when, you know, when maybe we shouldn't increase ridership, I don't know if we really, if it's legitimate, we'll do it anyways.	
7171.467	7186.633		 I really think if we were focusing strictly on increasing ridership, we would actually, it would all be disparately impacted in favor of all the communities we're worried about just based on the way population is distributed in the area.	
7187.114	7196.53		And I would like for us to kind of move towards a paradigm of focusing much, much more on increasing ridership across the board.	
7196.965	7202.02		 and less on finding possible reasons to not increase ridership.	
7203.163	7204.146		So I'll be in no vote.	
7204.166	7205.089		Thanks.	
7205.109	7205.951		Thank you, Director Larson.	
7206.032	7206.874		Secretary Nicholson.	
7208.491	7217.099		 So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session and a town hall all on this topic.	
7217.479	7228.369		And I should say, expertly facilitated by our co-chairs and by our chair of finance and our staff.	
7228.649	7234.294		And I feel like I just starting to get a decent understanding of it.	
7234.494	7238.498		Like I came into this knowing nothing about this.	
7238.478	7258.461		 I was an absolute no when we first started and my public remarks, you know, made that very clear but I want to commend staff and our board leadership who were willing to indulge because I came to understand it.	
7258.863	7270.864		 I came to understand what it was for, I came to understand how it works, and I don't necessarily agree with all of it, and I think we could use more data in addition to those data we have now to determine this, but...	
7271.992	7273.995		 If we don't pass this, we lose federal funding.	
7274.316	7276.479		So there's a good reason to pass it even if you don't like it.	
7278.021	7282.789		But on top of that, I just think our staff did their jobs.	
7283.29	7288.298		They have demonstrated to me this is the right thing to do despite my skepticism.	
7288.518	7290.341		And so I'm definitely voting for it tonight.	
7290.982	7291.723		Thank you.	
7291.743	7293.105		Any further comments on the main motion?	
7294.503	7295.205		 Okay, seeing none.	
7295.225	7298.011		We had Catlin as the mover and Guzman as the second.	
7298.532	7300.497		There is indication that there will be no votes.	
7300.557	7302.722		So I will be doing a roll call vote on this.	
7304.085	7304.846		Uh, treasurer banker.	
7304.866	7306.149		Uh, no.	
7308.034	7308.695		Director Catlin.	
7309.597	7309.818		Yes.	
7312.243	7313.085		Dr. Geisinger.	
7313.555	7313.835		 Yes.	
7314.937	7315.718		Dr. Gutierrez.	
7316.119	7316.439		Yes.	
7316.96	7317.621		Dr. Guzman.	
7317.821	7318.062		Yes.	
7318.362	7319.003		Dr. Harwick.	
7319.424	7319.844		Yes.	
7321.166	7321.847		Dr. Larson.	
7322.428	7322.649		No.	
7323.249	7324.051		Secretary Nicholson.	
7324.712	7324.992		I'm in.	
7326.294	7327.155		First Vice Chair O'Keeffe.	
7328.017	7328.257		Yes.	
7328.657	7329.439		Dr. Pagulari.	
7331.041	7331.321		Yes.	
7331.962	7332.603		Dr. Ruscha.	
7332.924	7334.666		Yep.	
7334.747	7335.748		Second Vice Chair Whitmore.	
7335.982	7336.282		 Yes.	
7337.043	7337.905		I'm also, yes.	
7338.345	7344.453		So the motion, the main motion will pass 11, two and two absent.	
7345.895	7346.095		Yes.	
7346.416	7348.258		That math adds up.	
7348.278	7348.559		Okay.	
7349.079	7359.773		Moving on, we're going to be moving to our next recommended action, which is the budget transfer articulated buses supporting Colfax bus rapid transit or BRT service.	
7359.873	7360.775		Do I have a mover?	
7361.736	7362.136		So moved.	
7362.176	7362.597		Guzman.	
7362.644	7363.726		 I have Guzman as the mover.	
7363.746	7364.447		Do I have a second?	
7364.567	7364.848		Second.	
7366.55	7366.711		Sir.	
7367.071	7367.792		Yeah.	
7367.812	7368.073		Oh, wait.	
7368.473	7369.114		Well, I could be wrong.	
7369.134	7369.455		I'm sorry.	
7370.256	7371.238		I forgot we started late.	
7371.498	7372.56		I thought we had our four hour mark.	
7373.041	7373.562		Please ignore me.	
7376.546	7377.087		Oh, sorry.	
7377.107	7378.87		Guzman is the mover.	
7378.93	7380.132		Whitmore is the second.	
7383.858	7384.9		Any discussion on it?	
7385.881	7386.863		Yeah, director Pagular.	
7387.231	7391.818		 I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting for this.	
7391.858	7404.438		I was not necessarily sure how this would further the clean energy and zero emission goals of the state of Colorado.	
7404.458	7409.025		And therefore, we'll just be voting now.	
7409.085	7409.425		Thank you.	
7411.949	7413.431		Any further conversation?	
7413.472	7414.453		Secretary Nicholson?	
7415.767	7419.856		 Yeah, so I understand where we're the importance of what we're doing here.	
7421.459	7430.839		I think that these buses in particular, you know, in my religion, there's a thing why is this night different from all other nights why are these buses different from all other buses.	
7432.068	7436.232		 These are going to be the flagship of our flagship BRT line.	
7437.093	7443.74		And if these suck, it will kill BRT.	
7444.28	7458.555		And if they are not comfortable, if they are not just awesome in every way possible, you can make a lot of choices when you buy a bus about how nice it's going to be in the same way you can make a lot of choices about when you buy a car about how nice it's going to be.	
7459.215	7462.058		And so I just want to lean in here	
7462.038	7484.939		 and I do have one question, to say that we need to pull the stops out, we need to make sure we're giving you enough money, GMCO Johnson, to make sure we're buying top of the line, to make sure that these are things that when they run through my district, people go, wow, I want to get on that, not, wow, that doesn't look very nice.	
7485.659	7492.045		And so my question for you is, how do you know that the amount of money that we're authorizing today	
7492.025	7494.128		 is enough to get top of the line.	
7494.909	7505.364		And how many bytes at the Apple are we going to get to make sure that you are buying the right buses for this incredibly important project?	
7506.565	7506.746		Ms.	
7506.806	7509.49		Johnson is 51 million enough to make them not suck.	
7510.671	7511.232		Yeah.	
7512.308	7515.09		 So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.	
7515.731	7517.733		And thank you for the question.	
7518.433	7519.594		My apologies.	
7519.634	7520.355		That was a good question.	
7520.575	7521.336		Keep it in mind.	
7521.356	7525.66		This is a budget transfer and full transparency.	
7526.18	7530.724		Director Nicholson emailed me about this because I think there was some confusion about where we are.	
7531.045	7532.626		There is yet to be a solicitation.	
7532.666	7534.488		There's yet to be specifications.	
7534.888	7541.674		So these monies that are being transferred or needed	
7542.076	7544.399		 for all intents and purposes so we can start a procurement.	
7546.841	7549.845		Now, keeping in mind, there's a couple of elements.	
7550.185	7558.355		These buses have to be dedicated because this is designated as a bus rapid transit project as defined by the Federal Transit Administration.	
7558.815	7564.402		There's certain criteria that we have to ensure that we adhere to.	
7564.462	7571.61		This will be a dedicated fleet just by virtue of the configuration of BRT with it being a center running platform.	
7572.097	7583.033		 So when you talk about it being top of the line, that's yet to be seen in reference to what we have before us because there's only two original equipment manufacturers in the United States.	
7583.093	7584.635		There's only so many suppliers.	
7584.996	7593.548		There are certain seeds and there is a national task force in which I sit where we're talking about doing away with customization because that increases prices.	
7593.798	7597.842		 I bet you don't know how many shades of white there is with new flier industries.	
7598.142	7598.323		24.	
7598.623	7599.684		How many?	
7599.704	7600.285		24.	
7600.305	7601.186		23.	
7601.446	7602.927		I think I told you that earlier.	
7603.008	7613.118		So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this, right, we're going to do our due diligence and we're going to ensure it's a competitive solicitation.	
7613.158	7620.526		And we do understand the aspects because that's what separates bus rapid transit from general thick route service.	
7621.427	7621.847		Thank you.	
7622.485	7624.928		 Secretary, I really appreciate it.	
7625.008	7629.695		And I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how the purchase is going.	
7632.098	7632.599		Yes.	
7632.619	7643.594		Uh, director Griswold, just really quickly, uh, with regards to this, moving this money from the unrestricted fund is simply to begin the procurement process.	
7644.115	7647.9		And although it's not part of the 2025 budget, we do need to get started on it.	
7648.501	7649.202		Um, however,	
7649.452	7656.6		 I would suggest that as we go forward, these buses are meant to be purchased in finality by 2027 to begin this service.	
7657.241	7668.754		And that is work that we will do to fully do on finance and planning to ensure that it is included in all necessary documents that come before this board for approval.

7739.668	7739.969		All right.	
7740.009	7740.669		Thank you, folks.	
7740.709	7741.75		So we have one.	
7742.171	7743.472		Chair Buke, could you remind us?	
7743.772	7748.577		Over here, we missed who the mover and the seconder were on that.	
7748.957	7749.938		I had Guzman and Whitmore.	
7750.278	7750.459		OK.	
7750.539	7750.839		Thank you.	
7751.54	7751.92		Thank you.	
7752.743	7753.624		 Um, okay.	
7753.644	7753.985		Excellent.	
7754.265	7755.787		Uh, thank you all again for your patience.	
7755.807	7761.734		We do have one more item and that is the equitable transit oriented development policy amendment.	
7763.096	7778.194		So for the board of directors to approve the amendment to resolution number two series of 2021, which created the equal transit oriented development policy that permits and encourages the development of affordable housing on RTD real property in order to include guidelines for disposing	
7778.461	7782.527		 of RTD real property, below fair market value or rent.	
7782.887	7783.548		Do we have a motion?	
7783.749	7784.49		So moved, Guzman.	
7784.69	7785.471		Guzman's the mover.	
7785.491	7786.092		Do we have a second?	
7786.613	7787.755		I have Harwick as a second.	
7789.697	7794.985		I do understand that on this item, we have some proposed amendments from Director Nicholson and Director Ruscha.	
7795.926	7799.772		Since Director Nicholson's amendment was circulated to the board first, we will start there.	
7800.393	7803.237		Director Nicholson, please now make your motion to amend.	
7803.824	7817.993		 Yes, I'd like to move to amend the etod policy and I'm hoping that GMC GMC that Mr. Crawl can put up those that language on the screen.	
7818.954	7819.395		It's there.	
7820.037	7820.217		Right.	
7821.92	7822.221		May I.	
7823.618	7826.363		 Uh, would you like to read the motion and then we'll get a second.	
7826.524	7826.884		Thank you.	
7826.924	7827.445		Yeah.	
7827.466	7841.593		So, uh, move to amend the policy, uh, such that section five of the equitable transit oriented development policy regarding negotiated land price be updated as follows to raise the maximum negotiated land price discount to 75% from 50%.	
7841.573	7859.97		 and add the following additional factors to favorably consider projects which include more accessible units than required by law, limit residential parking, are deeply affordable, emphasize priority groups as identified by the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority,	
7860.085	7870.429		 and incorporate smaller footprint retail, including below market rate units, below market rate retail, excuse me, that prioritizes local businesses and entrepreneurs.	
7873.236	7875.461		Excellent.	
7875.481	7876.403		And do we have a second on that?	
7876.985	7877.606		Second.	
7877.626	7878.448		Hardwick is the second.	
7880.521	7882.165		 Secretary, would you like to discuss further?	
7882.425	7882.786		Thank you.	
7882.806	7883.027		Yes.	
7883.367	7895.695		Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll to briefly describe the five pieces of written public comment that we received on this recommended action from some of our local public officials.	
7896.232	7904.392		 Yes, so four of the written public common items were submitted by individuals specifically supportive of the change director Nicholson is offering.	
7904.412	7914.055		And those four individuals were the mayor of Boulder, a city council member from Boulder, a city council member from Westminster and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.	
7914.035	7928.098		 And then the fifth letter was submitted by SWEAP in joint with Conservation Colorado and Denver Streets Partnership, which spoke more broadly to the overall changes being offered this evening.	
7930.943	7931.564		Perfect, Secretary.	
7932.045	7933.347		Thank you.	
7933.367	7935.891		And thank you, Executive Manager Crawl.	
7936.63	7939.394		 So here at RTD, we make lives better through connections.	
7939.755	7943.381		Tonight as a board, we have an opportunity to do that in a particularly powerful way.	
7944.242	7946.125		Our rider surveys tell a clear story.	
7946.666	7953.277		Over half our passengers live below 200% of the federal poverty level, and they are far less likely to own a car.	
7954.018	7960.849		Our riders with disabilities use RTD at disproportionately high rates, as do other vulnerable populations in our community.	
7960.829	7967.738		 Yet only a fraction of affordable housing developed near our stations truly meets the needs of our most dedicated riders.	
7968.419	7972.405		Communities in our state have struggled to create housing targeted at our ridership.	
7972.785	7979.134		Inclusionary zoning has mostly led to housing at 60% AMI, about $51,000 a year in earnings.	
7979.694	7988.406		This housing is necessary but priced well out of reach for someone making only $31,000, which is 200% of the federal poverty line.	
7988.386	7997.766		 This amendment empowers RTD to deepen our land discount offerings, up to 75%, to incentivize projects specifically tailored to the actual economic realities of our riders.	
7998.428	8000.151		Here's how that can work in practice.	
8000.171	8007.407		Just this month, Denver Health donated the land to create Tapestry, a deeply affordable, accessible, transit-oriented housing project.	
8007.775	8016.789		 It supports a range of affordability from 30% to 80%, as well as far more three-bedroom and even four-bedroom units than most affordable projects being built today.	
8017.59	8024.842		It targets accessibility because distance to transit is a major barrier for people with disabilities to use transit.	
8024.862	8032.213		This holds for all types of disabilities and unfortunately, painfully few Class A fully accessible units exist	
8032.193	8033.715		 in the RTD service area.	
8034.255	8038.579		By creating greater incentives for developers, we can do a lot to play our part in fixing that.	
8039.34	8045.767		It's late, so I won't go through the argument for reduced parking and the service of CHFA's priority populations.	
8046.047	8047.649		You all have an email from me with that data.	
8048.169	8054.616		But I do want Director Harwick to speak after me to address the language he added on smaller footprint and below market retail.	
8055.437	8061.863		Community is about more than housing, and I enthusiastically added his language for the reasons he'll highlight.	
8062.113	8066.82		 This framework recognizes that we are not the housing policy experts.	
8067.341	8086.29		It increases the scope of our tools and trusts our staff to use them effectively to bring us thoughtful projects, projects that align with our strategic priority of community value and enable us to grow ridership by putting the people who most need transit where they can best be served by it.	
8086.831	8088.233		I ask your support for this amendment.	
8088.754	8088.954		Thank you.	
8089.856	8090.196		Dr. Harbert.	
8091.661	8108.05		 Yeah, so I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD that we're really thinking also about mixed use TOD and I'm wildly in favor of Anything that we can do to bring more housing let alone affordable housing to	
8108.03	8109.191		 to our park and rides.	
8109.211	8120.846		I do think it's really key that we also think about what are the businesses that we are bringing in there and, you know, having spent a lot of time working at Starbucks and a good friend of mine works at Starbucks.	
8120.866	8129.717		You know, I'm also really in favor of coffee shops like Prodigy and smaller shops, but also thinking about when I've traveled to other	
8129.697	8152.144		 Communities throughout the world there oftentimes are smaller retail shops that give Young entrepreneurs that opportunity to start a business and not be burdened by a larger footprint that Some of our larger restaurants or larger retail shops can they can cover those those costs so you know this this to me was a way to encourage local businesses to	
8152.124	8167.852		 start up or expand and, you know, give them the opportunity in a place that we all, you know, we all, when we go to a parking ride and there's not something there to grab that quick bite to eat, I want to give them that opportunity, everyone that opportunity, one to shop there and sell there.	
8169.415	8172.26		Director Harwick, any further discussion on this amendment?	
8173.362	8173.963		Director Usha.	
8174.23	8176.513		 Uh, Mr. Chair, maybe you can help me here.	
8176.613	8181.94		So I had a comment slash, but I had a comment on the main motion, but we moved to amendments.	
8182.361	8188.269		But like recognizing that Secretary Nicholson's language can't exist without the motion language of the way it's drafted.	
8188.489	8190.432		May I just make a general comment?	
8190.452	8191.373		Does that sort of make sense?	
8191.533	8196.56		It would apply to both, but I don't know if I would be called out of order and I'm tired of what you say.	
8196.6	8197.201		So you know what?	
8197.221	8197.641		Why not?	
8197.721	8198.783		Let's give it a try.	
8198.863	8199.664		Thanks.	
8199.644	8200.305		 I'm doing my best.	
8200.826	8212.644		Okay, so this morning we got an email from staff that addressed some outstanding questions that I still had, just so I knew what I was voting on.	
8213.205	8226.225		And I have a heartburn over just the main motion because the way it's written, we as a board,	
8226.475	8240.03		 are not just expanding the bounds of what a policy is, we're also signing away like 30 plus years of precedent of having this guardrail that says, before you go dispense of real property, get our preliminary authorization.	
8240.651	8248.6		So I guess like I've, so I am already a little bit uncomfortable.	
8249.0	8251.723		And also the policy says that if	
8252.092	8258.579		 A developer, as it relates to housing, cannot meet our 50% standard.	
8259.039	8264.105		They could still get a major discount, and it could be millions and millions of dollars.	
8264.645	8271.312		And so those two combined, and just recognizing that these deals take a long, long time, they're not suburb projects.	
8272.794	8281.643		In sum, it means that all of that is going to happen, and then it's going to come back to the board when all of those decisions have been made.	
8281.859	8301.235		 and that and so it's for that because I'm struggling with the original proposal but I can accept it for now is why I can't vote yes on Secretary Nicholson's amendment because it doesn't because we don't have guardrails that I would prefer so I	
8301.603	8305.688		 I hope that was not out of order and if it was, thanks for not calling me out of order.	
8305.708	8306.069		Thank you.	
8306.409	8307.13		Are you director chef?	
8307.471	8308.032		Director Guzmore.	
8308.873	8315.642		So, ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee and this is my concern.	
8318.446	8324.033		Although I am with you in spirit, deeply affordable housing is really important.	
8324.519	8333.892		 I'm not sure that giving an additional 25% discount in our policy is wise for a number of reasons.	
8334.233	8338.679		I do believe, however, and maybe Madam CEO or Ms.	
8338.719	8341.403		Chessie Brady might be able to speak to this, I'm not sure.	
8343.206	8350.476		What we were asked for in this policy was to give guidelines to begin negotiation that would eventually come back to this board.	
8351.688	8363.853		 Let's say a developer comes to us and just brings us an amazing proposal that includes everything that you could want in a development and more.	
8363.873	8369.605		I don't see why they wouldn't necessarily come back to us and say, hey, they're willing to do all of these things.	
8369.985	8370.827		They being staff.	
8371.145	8385.639		 and asking for an additional amount of up to whatever amount makes sense to give that discount from the board that we would consider properly and then be able to authorize in that moment.	
8386.379	8392.866		But in order to begin the process, we were simply asked to give authorization for them to work within a parameter.	
8392.926	8399.272		That way there was no confusion that they would be able to do a 30 to 50% discount as was written in the original policy.	
8399.772	8400.713		Beyond that,	
8401.385	8408.376		 the board would still have authority, as I understand it, if we were asked to offer an additional discount for more.	
8409.037	8426.785		I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of the agency.	
8426.945	8428.928		And so I would like to ask that question	
8429.431	8442.383		 Is there anything that would prevent you from coming back to us if we were to receive such an excellent proposal that prevents you from saying, can we receive an additional discount to offer a developer board?	
8443.125	8445.33		And would you approve this so we can make a project work?	
8447.116	8447.296		 Ms.	
8447.316	8449.059		Brady, first off, thank you for your patience.	
8449.079	8451.122		I greatly appreciate you sticking around tonight.	
8451.162	8451.602		Of course.	
8451.923	8453.204		You're recognized.	
8453.525	8453.865		Thank you.	
8454.526	8457.45		No, there is nothing that would stop us from doing that.	
8457.931	8463.639		As you say, the point of the policy is to create guardrails and certainty within those guardrails.	
8464.38	8473.652		We would use the opinions of the board to guide developers towards what we think the board would be interested in as we're negotiating with them.	
8473.753	8474.794		And we would come back to the board	
8475.112	8477.235		 for approval of any given project.	
8478.056	8478.417		Thank you.	
8479.218	8491.356		One more quick thing and Director Banker, Treasurer Banker, the sales and the lease income from our real estate properties are put into a specific account.	
8491.456	8492.398		Can you guess which one?	
8493.139	8504.916		Because when we deeply discount things beyond where we should, we are saying no to the potential income that we could use for operations and maintenance and service provision	
8505.554	8506.636		 elsewhere in the agency.	
8507.296	8514.907		So on balance, real estate and real property are a finite resource, and dollars can be stretched thin.	
8515.668	8526.324		But how we use the opportunity to either receive money to prolong and serve the public further is a huge consideration in this.	
8526.564	8531.191		So although I am with you in spirit, I would be voting no on the amendment as it is right now.	
8531.872	8532.492		Thank you, Director.	
8533.434	8534.295		Director Pagulieri.	
8534.63	8536.292		 Thank you, I'll be brief.	
8536.712	8541.438		I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply agree with.	
8542.219	8543.801		I am a little bit concerned about two things.	
8543.841	8546.544		The first is the language deeply affordable.	
8546.564	8551.309		It's a little bit ambiguous, if I'm saying that right.	
8552.291	8562.983		And I think using language like that can, like, what's to say, they discounted $100 to some, that's a deep discount to others, that's nothing.	
8562.963	8570.914		 So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can divine it elsewhere.	
8571.435	8573.638		But I do want to leave this language.	
8573.658	8581.95		And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that I want.	
8581.93	8598.726		 And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75%, but this is our property and I really would like to see it sold for the highest value to benefit all.	
8598.947	8599.287		Thank you.	
8599.788	8601.913		Thank you, Director.	
8602.889	8605.332		 Just a quick question.	
8605.892	8613.261		Some of these surplus properties that we're talking about, we are not including our current park and rides, correct?	
8614.282	8620.489		Would be excess land, perhaps around a park and ride, but not one of our park and rides.	
8622.011	8622.992		Just clarification.	
8623.733	8624.214		Thank you.	
8624.234	8628.158		So this policy is aimed at transoriented development.	
8628.619	8630.601		So property that RTD owns	
8630.8	8633.784		 at transit stations or near high frequency transit.	
8634.404	8647.24		Access property and surplus property are definable terms that perhaps Michelle could help us with, but those are distinctive properties that the board has named to be excess and surplus.	
8647.661	8650.384		And so I just want to separate that from a park and ride.	
8650.424	8652.407		A park and ride is certainly not excess or surplus.	
8653.268	8655.531		It may have underutilized land.	
8655.691	8659.896		It may have a large drainage area that is part of the park and ride.	
8660.551	8669.414		 But not every development that we would consider on a park and ride would remove parking if that's getting more to your question.	
8670.216	8670.938		Okay, yes.	
8673.425	8674.307		Secretary Nicholson.	
8675.435	8678.138		 I actually have some questions for Ms.	
8678.659	8678.979		Brady.	
8679.62	8684.386		So first off, Director Pagliari raised the concern about the term deep affordability.	
8685.006	8689.612		I think you and I know what that means, but maybe the rest of the board doesn't, given it's a term of art.	
8689.672	8693.356		Can you elaborate on what that's referring to?	
8694.097	8694.258		Ms.	
8694.298	8694.538		Brady.	
8694.978	8695.279		Sure.	
8695.339	8695.519		Yes.	
8695.819	8703.889		Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means generally 30 to 40% of AMI.	
8704.308	8709.427		 It is squishy, I think still, but generally it's understood to mean 30 to 40%.	
8709.487	8711.635		Secretary.	
8712.07	8719.36		 So second question, I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as a discount.	
8721.042	8734.541		I was hoping maybe you could speak to like, because I mentioned it a little bit, but as someone who's an expert in the space, and I will say you and I worked pretty closely together on this language and went back and forth, you did a meeting with me.	
8734.621	8737.024		So this isn't just something that I wrote myself.	
8737.104	8741.47		This is something that got vetted pretty heavily by staff.	
8742.395	8758.017		 What impact does a greater discount have on the types of projects that in the affordable housing space you tend to see people able to build?	
8758.077	8762.243		At least from where I sit, the reason for doing this is that	
8762.223	8771.859		 When it comes to those deeply affordable, which are deeply subsidized units, when it comes to things like units that are fully accessible, those are expensive.	
8772.12	8778.551		They cost developers money, which is why when you don't have those subsidies, those units don't get built.	
8778.611	8782.257		I think it's about half the projects that are in the CHFA database.	
8782.237	8790.49		 have zero units at 30% AMI and very few of them have anything with regard to accessibility.	
8790.51	8796.559		So I'm hoping you can maybe elaborate on, you know, you're the one who would be using this tool at the end of the day.	
8796.599	8801.246		How do you see it coming in handy with regard to what you're able to do?	
8801.867	8803.33		And then I've won the last follow up.	
8805.152	8805.493		It's pretty.	
8809.159	8809.459		You're not.	
8813.185	8820.073		 Thank you.	
8820.793	8824.778		So affordable housing projects aren't notoriously difficult to finance.	
8825.479	8836.13		And I mean, I think if you use the example earlier of tapestry and Denver health, Denver health, as you stated is correct donated the land for tapestry.	
8836.17	8840.235		I can assure you that that development was still very difficult to finance.	
8841.076	8841.336		So	
8841.569	8851.042		 even if the land we were giving the land at 100% discount, the projects would still not pencil in many cases.	
8851.563	8869.888		And so our ability to discount the land to 75% as the board prefers just in many cases could get us over the hump from a project not being built to a project being built and to that project having more affordable units as opposed to	
8870.105	8873.649		 a higher, more of a middle income range.	
8874.309	8876.752		And that's the difference that the land discount makes.	
8877.112	8887.704		And that's the certainty that this policy helps me bring to conversations with developers is, gets them in the mindset of we're going to get some help here from RTD.	
8888.484	8891.107		We can focus on deeper affordability units.	
8891.127	8898.475		We can make bigger promises to Chaffa or other financing entities to host in Denver.	
8898.877	8900.839		 It helps us keep the projects moving.	
8901.42	8909.047		Um, but, and I'd be frank with you, this is, as I said, tapestry, even with a hundred percent discount, it's still hard to do.	
8909.227	8910.569		This is not a silver bullet.	
8911.169	8917.135		Um, but it, it moves the needle and it helps us actually, you know, keep projects afloat and get to the finish line.	
8917.555	8917.996		Thank you, Ms.	
8918.016	8918.356		Brady.	
8918.597	8921.96		We're going to wrap up with director O'Keith and then director Larson.	
8922.46	8924.142		Oh, I thought I got last word.	
8924.847	8927.854		 So, I support this amendment.	
8927.994	8939.161		I think it is a reasonable step toward developing communities that are very likely to use our services.	
8939.301	8943.531		And I think increasing ridership is something	
8943.511	8944.613		 we all agree on.	
8944.653	8946.916		This is a concrete way to do that.	
8948.018	8958.052		It also takes land not just for our benefit in ridership, but also puts improvements on it that helps the tax base.	
8958.473	8972.353		And I think the communities that we serve would rather see a housing project end up on that property where it becomes improved.	
8972.333	8973.815		 versus somewhere else.	
8973.835	8975.136		We're not the only game in town.	
8975.176	8976.778		There's a lot of discounts out there.	
8977.518	8983.505		And so we're not necessarily in a tight buyers market.	
8983.645	8985.907		There's a lot of projects that can go forward.	
8986.588	8994.797		And I think we need to put our best deal, at least give Chessie and the rest of the team the tools to bring the deal forward.	
8995.758	8997.279		I do want to put one plug in.	
8997.319	8998.18		We talked about it.	
8998.481	9000.703		I don't think round leases	
9000.683	9003.386		 are the best tool in Colorado.	
9003.426	9006.791		First of all, it's not as common as other places in the world.	
9007.431	9015.642		And the other thing is toward the end of your ground lease, no matter how long you make it, the property will fall into disrepair.	
9015.942	9021.409		They are not going to put money into physical facilities that are going to roll off their books.	
9021.389	9029.08		 So, for that reason, I like the discount is great and I love a sale versus a ground lease.	
9029.1	9031.383		And I know you'll keep that in mind as we go forward.	
9032.084	9039.876		And anyway, that's another argument in favor of that tactic.	
9039.896	9040.456		Director Bill Arson.	
9042.399	9042.86		Thank you.	
9043.1	9046.485		I'm going to be a no vote on this.	
9046.938	9050.763		 I don't agree with our transit oriented development policy as it is right now.	
9050.983	9057.752		I don't agree with the goal of trying to provide affordable housing or encourage it, incentivize it.	
9058.132	9062.198		I think we should be focused on trying to increase ridership.	
9062.218	9071.95		If we want to provide discounts on our land, we should provide them with the goal in mind of increasing the number of people that can live	
9072.335	9077.22		 on the property, whatever is developed, and the amount of traffic that is on the property.	
9078.381	9080.823		So I'm a no on this.	
9081.504	9082.404		Thank you, Director Larson.	
9082.545	9082.845		All right.	
9083.265	9085.247		The indication there is a no vote.	
9085.587	9087.109		I am going to do a roll call vote.	
9087.189	9090.332		As a reminder, we are voting on Director Nicholson's amendment.	
9090.832	9093.755		He was the mover and Director Harwick is the second.	
9094.536	9095.256		Treasure banker.	
9098.62	9098.8		Yes.	
9098.82	9099.44		Director Catlin.	
9100.922	9101.262		Yes.	
9102.068	9102.869		 Director Keisinger?	
9103.189	9103.75		Yes.	
9103.77	9104.571		Director Gucinander?	
9105.092	9105.612		Yes.	
9105.632	9106.313		Director Guzman?	
9106.594	9107.735		No.	
9107.755	9108.396		Director Harwick?	
9108.556	9108.796		Yes.	
9109.717	9110.458		Director Larsen?	
9111.419	9111.62		No.	
9112.721	9113.922		Secretary Nicholson?	
9113.942	9114.183		Yes.	
9115.064	9115.905		First Vice-Chair O'Keefe?	
9116.706	9116.926		Yes.	
9117.487	9118.268		Director Pagulari?	
9118.748	9119.009		Yes.	
9119.569	9120.21		Director Ruscha?	
9122.873	9123.454		Sorry, no.	
9124.375	9125.797		And finally, Second Vice-Chair Whitmore?	
9126.358	9126.658		Yes.	
9127.465	9138.662		 Okay, and I am a yes, that amendment will pass 10, two, excuse me, 10, three and two.	
9140.845	9145.652		Yes, 10, yes, three, no, two absent, that is the math.	
9146.253	9152.663		Okay, moving on, we are gonna do our second amendment, which was brought forward by Director Ruscha.	
9154.128	9157.552		 And Director Ruscha, would you like to introduce the language of the amendment?	
9159.454	9162.358		It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman.	
9163.038	9170.067		And I think he has the language in front of him.	
9170.087	9171.208		Director Guzman.	
9171.228	9172.209		Thank you, Mr. Chair.	
9172.249	9183.342		We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end of this policy that says, additionally, no project will be eligible for any discounts unless it complies with the greater of the following.	
9184.148	9195.53		 5% of all units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities and an additional 2% of all units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities or to current U.S.	
9195.55	9198.616		Department of Housing, Urban Development Accessibility requirements.	
9200.921	9201.702		Do you have a second?	
9202.745	9203.766		 We have Russia's second.	
9204.828	9205.91		Uh, Mr. Crow.	
9205.93	9206.27		I'm sorry.	
9206.631	9218.207		Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the highlighted portion above would be deleted and is not included in your motion.	
9218.267	9218.648		Correct?	
9218.748	9219.089		Correct.	
9221.973	9222.133		Correct.	
9222.153	9225.879		So the language we see, this would substitute the language.	
9226.419	9226.72		Okay.	
9226.88	9227.18		Perfect.	
9227.601	9231.907		Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get this done.	
9231.927	9232.448		Director Russia.	
9233.913	9238.8		 I was happy to speak to motion, but I wasn't sure if we were, I'm tired.	
9239.1	9239.461		Is that okay?	
9240.502	9240.602		Okay.	
9240.622	9244.728		I got Guzman as the mover and Risha as the second and we're up for a conversation.	
9244.808	9244.989		Okay.	
9245.009	9245.73		You're up, Dr. Risha.	
9246.09	9246.511		Thank you, sir.	
9246.551	9246.831		Okay.	
9246.851	9263.194		So just for everyone's identification, we struck the first sentence, it was a two sentence amendment, just recognizing that we didn't have full staff concurrence on the first sentence, which would have applied this accessibility minimum to market rate housing.	
9263.174	9268.001		 And sometimes you shoot for the stars and land on the moon.	
9269.003	9276.434		The second sentence, which just applies the HUD requirement to affordable housing, we did get staff concurrence.	
9276.454	9278.978		So that's just the, that was the context behind that.	
9280.741	9282.263		I sent out like a	
9283.39	9290.701		 I kind of frequently ask questions in anticipation of some questions, so I'm happy to entertain any or we can address them.	
9291.202	9312.553		I will say that we worked for three weeks and some change on this with housing advocates and folks who had worked in the space and people who had worked at CHAFA and at the state level on similar policy and advocacy organizations and then staff and legal.	
9312.955	9322.209		 So, I mean, just, I'm sorry, I am tired, too.	
9322.469	9334.407		In case anybody has any questions about what this is, I think just simplify it and say that HUD has a	
9334.673	9338.438		 current minimum accessibility requirement for funding, right?	
9338.538	9347.108		And it's 5% of units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, additional 2% of units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities.	
9347.909	9355.538		And so a lot of times in these projects, that HUD requirement is going to kick in, but not all projects are going to have HUD dollars.	
9356.139	9361.305		So just recognizing that a lot of jurisdictions take that HUD standard, which is	
9361.522	9366.267		 I maybe miss Brady can correct me, but I think it's 20 plus years old, 30 plus years old now.	
9366.868	9371.913		Um, and they also incorporate that into their policies or their code or statute.	
9372.193	9375.016		We did the same kind of good for goose, good for gander.	
9375.797	9378.059		Um, I will stop there.	
9378.079	9387.529		Uh, unless anyone else has further questions or, or comment questions or comments on this amendment, uh, Dr. Catlin and then secretary Nicholson.	
9388.91	9404.835		 I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the First Amendment that we passed does give a lot of latitude towards Chessie and her staff to negotiate.	
9405.556	9413.989		And I fear that this one might be a little bit too regulatory and prescriptive.	
9415.707	9425.74		 If that's the HUD requirement and somebody is applying for a HUD grant, then this would be taken care of automatically.	
9426.341	9435.453		So right now I'm willing to listen to other discussions, but I fear that it would not give Ms.	
9435.493	9442.643		Brady and her staff the maximum flexibility to look at the comprehensive merits of a proposal.	
9445.441	9447.002		 Um, yeah, Ms.	
9447.022	9448.444		Spriby.	
9448.464	9448.664		Yeah.	
9448.824	9461.496		So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver already requires, for example, and the Colorado Department of Housing is already considering a higher threshold of requirement.	
9461.576	9464.378		So I have, I have no concerns about incorporating this.	
9464.458	9468.122		I think it, it's already going to be taken care of in most cases.	
9468.522	9471.164		If I might, that's kind of my point.	
9471.265	9472.866		It seems a little bit redundant.	
9476.339	9477.14		 Secretary Nicholson.	
9478.223	9481.388		I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's all right.	
9482.991	9483.573		To the amendment.	
9483.753	9484.174		Thank you.	
9485.396	9486.799		Just to clarify, that was a question.	
9486.919	9488.622		You would like to offer an amendment to the amendment?	
9488.983	9489.143		Yes.	
9490.666	9491.327		Let's have an amendment.	
9491.543	9492.985		 Mr. Krull.	
9493.005	9521.382		Technically the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy and this is an amendment to that amendment and at this point you would be amending an amendment to an amendment which is not allowed under Robert's rules so you would need to tackle this amendment as it's being presented and then if you feel so inclined offer an amendment to whatever state the	
9521.362	9547.437		 uh policy is in at that point rock on uh secretary yeah so at that point i would say i'd have to be a no been for the very simple reason um where it says no project will be eligible we're talking about an uh equitable tod policy here um which is specifically focused on using our land to facilitate like the literally the policy is about giving discounts um i can't see	
9547.417	9570.437		 putting something like this in there unless it is related to said discount so I'd be fine if it said additionally no project receiving a discount will be eligible for any discounts etc unless it complies with but I don't necessarily think it makes sense to do market rate policy in an etod policy thank you secretary i have treasurer banker and then director isha	
9570.637	9571.959		 It's just real quick.	
9571.999	9585.199		Have you perhaps considered something more positive saying something like along the lines greater consideration would be given a project if these items were attained as opposed to make it mandatory?	
9588.183	9589.786		Dr. Risha or Dr. Kisman?	
9589.806	9592.189		Again, sort of an amendment, but just a thought.	
9592.97	9593.111		Thanks.	
9593.131	9597.437		So I just want to address what Secretary Nicholson said.	
9597.856	9605.885		 I might have missed part of the closed captioning, but I think you said you don't think we should be applying accessibility minimums to market rate.	
9606.826	9607.047		Okay.	
9607.387	9607.988		That's exact.	
9608.188	9608.508		We don't.	
9608.829	9609.69		So this amendment doesn't do that.	
9610.09	9623.226		And the second piece, um, the reason why I didn't say it doesn't reference discounts is because, uh, so this goes at the end of the policy, which is all, like the way it's nested under the paragraph, the discount, this is talking about when discounts apply, if that makes sense.	
9623.606	9624.387		So it's just,	
9625.902	9629.167		 It does what you said you wanted it to do.	
9629.187	9630.128		It's just late.	
9630.669	9631.19		On Nicholson.	
9631.41	9631.751		Thank you.	
9632.171	9636.358		And then the, I guess the only question I have for, and this is actually for Ms.	
9636.398	9637.9		Brady, if that's okay.	
9638.401	9650.138		Under what, because you mentioned that Denver has a policy that supersede or that matches this and the state currently is considering a policy that would supersede it, but currently does not.	
9650.675	9654.661		 Under what circumstances would this have any effect at all?	
9654.841	9662.933		Like in what circumstances can you imagine in your professional capacity, do you see this being something that would matter?	
9664.034	9664.194		Ms.	
9664.234	9664.515		Brady?	
9665.276	9669.682		Yes, in a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units.	
9669.842	9675.07		And Director Rush has mentioned some, I'm not aware of them, but this is not my area of expertise.	
9675.09	9680.057		So, but in a jurisdiction that does not already have those requirements that is not	
9680.257	9693.936		 accepting HUD money, and if Colorado Department of Housing changes their rules, does not accept Department of Housing money, then that project would then be subject to this policy requirement.	
9695.819	9696.239		Thank you, Ms.	
9696.28	9696.56		Breedy.	
9696.88	9697.702		Secretary, quickly.	
9698.543	9710.179		Yeah, just, I guess, for Director Rusher, Director Guzman, are there any jurisdictions in the RTD service area that don't have that same requirement that Denver does?	
9712.1	9712.901		 either directors?	
9714.303	9718.991		Yeah, I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate jurisdictions.	
9719.051	9727.383		So I'm just going to have to lean into this is E TOD and the E is equitable.	
9727.904	9733.292		We spend a lot of time talking about equity today, including spending a significant amount of time talking about people with disabilities.	
9733.813	9739.542		And so just again, recognizing that the HUD requirement	
9742.61	9758.492		 is about equity and not excluding people on the basis of disability from accessing affordable housing because the FH Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and other areas of anti-discrimination law, including state law, don't effectively	
9758.995	9760.377		 covered that aspect.	
9761.599	9763.041		Sorry, that was more than what you asked.	
9763.061	9765.125		But no, I can't answer your question.	
9766.867	9777.083		Just like you probably couldn't answer my question about every single jurisdiction in the RTD region that has something regarding parking minimums.	
9778.024	9779.126		It's a broad concept.	
9780.528	9781.29		Thank you, Director Usha.	
9781.73	9783.773		Any further conversation on this amendment?	
9784.915	9785.636		Dr. Guzman.	
9785.656	9787.399		I will offer this last thing.	
9787.733	9801.912		 and then we probably should go to a vote, but very simply put, we need to make sure that we are protecting the vulnerable, providing access to these housing units.	
9802.193	9805.477		Even in the city and county of Denver's building codes is not clear.	
9805.537	9806.839		It's as clear as mud.	
9807.14	9813.326		 There is reference to this if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not necessarily required.	
9813.366	9822.155		We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to get licensed.	
9822.836	9835.408		And so to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units, I would like to see this in the policy.	
9835.591	9848.383		 I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement that's established.	
9848.423	9860.655		And although it is established in other places, it is not established in our policy, and we are the government of this region, and we should take it seriously that we have a due diligence and responsibility to those members of our community that would need this.	
9860.875	9863.117		Thank you.	
9864.683	9870.373		 I always have to follow you, Director Guzman, but obviously I'm very in support.	
9870.633	9881.672		Any time that we can be supportive of our communities most in need, those suffering from a whole variety of disabilities, I want to be able to put our best foot forward there.	
9882.113	9886.54		And while we can't call specific jurisdictions, if there is that	
9886.52	9893.495		 chance that there is a jurisdiction that isn't meeting this requirement, then we should make sure we're getting there.	
9893.555	9899.087		And if in the process the state comes up with something better or something in the future, that's okay.	
9899.448	9906.503		But I think that this is a safety net in my mind about how to really get there for this community.	
9908.727	9925.158		 I think that also, as we're tying these developments, spur off around our transit, that's also giving them better access to the resources and giving them the life that they want and the freedom of movement that we so cherish.	
9925.218	9927.242		So I'm highly in support of this.	
9927.222	9927.562		 Thank you.	
9928.043	9929.304		Secretary, less than 30 seconds.	
9930.606	9934.17		This question is for Chessie.	
9934.41	9942.299		My understanding with this language is that it applies to buildings with elevators in it.	
9942.419	9956.976		And so with single stair buildings, that there are different policies around equitable access because of the challenges, obviously, in a single stair building of getting people into the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth floor.	
9957.277	9960.686		 You're probably the biggest expert on this in the room.	
9961.869	9973.159		Do you see any concerns with this language when it comes to buildings with stairs only versus elevators?	
9973.865	9983.579		 I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable, I do know that equitable access and accessible units are different things and have different requirements.	
9984.4	9987.885		And so we're talking specifically about accessible units.	
9989.207	9995.476		We're also not, we're tending to be talking about larger buildings because we do want them to be dense at stations.	
9995.497	10000.183		So I think they're typically going to be elevator buildings, but I don't have any concerns about that.	
10000.203	10000.584		Thank you, Ms.	
10000.604	10000.864		Brady.	
10001.365	10002.707		Let's do the roll call vote.

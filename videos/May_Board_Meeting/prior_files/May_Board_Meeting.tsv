31	2534	Comments, feel free to come up to the podium.
6018	8381	Seeing none, were there any emailed comments, Mr. Carroll?
8561	9262	There were a number.
9302	12466	I am not going to go through all 46 and read the names.
12666	19575	However, you received 36 letters with respect to Northwest Rail and the IGA conversation that you held earlier today.
19615	24341	Five letters with respect to the ETOD policy you will consider later this evening.
24861	29667	Three letters with respect to Title VI policy or the program update.
29917	42896	You all will consider later this evening, one regarding the National Women's Soccer League proposed stadium that was discussed earlier here in person, and one regarding paratransit AOD program modifications.
43497	45961	All will be appended to the transcript of this meeting.
46421	59080	And just as a reminder to directors, a majority of these written public comments were submitted to the RTD.directors email group, which you all have access to and can see in real time.
59819	60740	Thank you, Mr. Krull.
61060	65105	With no other participants in the queue, we will now close public participation at this time.
66346	69009	Moving on to our next item, external entities report.
69290	72533	We have no external entity reports this month.
74035	76137	Moving on to our next item, discussion items.
76518	83245	We have one discussion item on the agenda this evening, which is a holdover from last week's operation safety and security committee meeting.
84102	87008	It is the access on demand program modifications.
87710	93583	I would like to offer the floor to GM CEO Deborah Johnson for some opening remarks before introducing Ms.
93924	94405	Vallejo's.
95808	97331	Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
97832	102583	Good afternoon or evening, board members, Deborah Johnson, general manager and chief executive officer.
103238	111572	I am joined by Aaron Valleos, who serves as the Acting Assistant or Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations.
112033	125196	And as indicated in your remarks, we are here referencing the previous agendized topic at the Operations Safety and Security Committee that we did not get to and wanted to have this conversation.
125176	154879	with you all this evening, the intent of this presentation is to ground all board members in our paratransit programs, but more specifically, what we are seeking from this body is some guidance relative to access on demand, which is a supplemental premium service as relates to paratransit services, not the American with Disabilities Act of 1990, Complementary Paratransit Services.
154859	160708	And in doing so, this conversation will help us guide our path forward.
161750	171966	Specifically, I think what's notable for everybody to understand that the current paratransit contracts that we have for access on demand do sunset at the end of December.
172547	177795	We have had conversations relative to modifications and absence of having some guidance
177775	189491	We run the risk of not having any type of services and hence why it's so imperative is that we adhere to open and fair competition in order to do a solicitation relative to services.
189571	197522	We have to have some guidance relative to the specifications that would be included in a solicitation for a request for proposal.
198043	205673	So this is not for you to make a decision relative to where we are but provide guidance because what we anticipate doing with said guidance
205653	210938	and bringing forward these scenarios after meeting with some board members, i.e.
212039	227432	Chair Ruscha and Director Chandler, that are both on the Operation Safety and Security Committee, is to seek that direction so we can then go out to the customer segments and garner a better understanding.
227472	234158	While we've heard comments here, we have taken part in a myriad of different public participation engagements
234138	247755	and want to ensure that we are being good fiscal stewards, but also ensuring that we are providing the independence and ability for all aspects of our population to be able to travel and move about to and fro.
247815	251099	So with that being said, I will yield the floor to Ms.
251179	253842	Filaios to commence with the presentation.
253902	257526	If we could have board office staff pull that up, that would be appreciated.
257727	258087	Thank you.
276950	278712	been a while since I've used these microphones.
279333	280155	Good evening, everyone.
280415	288126	As GMCEO Johnson said, I'm Erin Vallejoz, the acting deputy assistant general manager for bus operations.
288707	292171	And we are just going to go over just kind of a quick overview.
292231	296798	I think it's a lot of information that you've already seen, so we won't spend too much time on that.
297118	300443	Just kind of hit on what the initial recommendation was that we made.
300423	308458	talk about some revised recommendations and then again kind of open it up for discussion to kind of get an idea of some direction.
308692	308912	Ms.
308952	312037	Faleos before, could you speak a little closer to the microphone?
312057	312799	Yes, I can.
312819	313400	Thank you so much.
313440	314281	Of course.
314301	326481	Okay, so just to kind of highlight on this again as GM CEO Johnson said, Accessor Ride and Access on Demand are the two programs that we have.
326681	333332	Accessor Ride is RTD's federally required ADA complimentary paratransit service.
333312	336420	It does supplement our fixed route services.
336480	349212	There is a fair payment required for these services and customers must meet the criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to be eligible.
349192	355840	This is provided with all RTD branded access ride vehicles that are all 100 percent accessible.
356781	361547	Then access on demand is our supplemental premium paratransit service.
362308	366093	It is a curb-to-curb taxi and ride share service.
366794	378608	It is available to current paratransit customers, so they must meet those eligibility criteria to qualify for access ride to then use access on demand.
378588	384947	And as it stands today, RTD pays the first $25 of the trip and the remaining portion is paid by the customer.
385830	389661	And again, ability today to take 60 total trips.
390502	392826	So just some quick operating statistics.
392966	400839	The annual operating cost in 2024 for excessive ride was just over 53 million and the customer trips were just over 500,000.
400979	410434	And again, these are RTD owned vehicles and the contractors that operate this service have over 500 drivers mechanics and other staff.
410414	415968	And then access on demand slash year it was about just over 15 3 million for the budget.
418174	423327	Just over 685,000 trips and these are all provided by third party vehicles.
425180	431508	So again, as we touched on, you must be eligible for access ride to also use access on demand.
432790	442222	There is a process that customers must go through that determines if a customer has a disabling condition that would prevent them from using a regular fixed route service.
443203	450192	There's an application process, a medical verification process, and then an in-person assessment that customers must complete.
450172	454719	And there are a couple of different types of eligibility that a customer could receive.
454899	460448	Unconditional means you can have access to the full service for up to four years.
460988	466797	Temporary, you might have a condition that's going to improve recovering from surgery or something along those lines.
467398	473708	And then conditional would be when there was something maybe you're sensitive to extreme hot or extreme cold.
474208	477934	So you would be able to use it at those times, but not the full year.
479686	485693	Okay, and as we have touched on, this is something that you've probably seen as well.
486473	490638	We are continuing to see an increase in access on demand usage.
491179	498246	This is through 2024, but we continue to see that access on demand trend line going up into the start of this year.
498266	507837	And access ride, when you look at the trend line, while it is staying a little bit more stable, we are still seeing an increase in usage there as well.
510010	518685	And as we've talked about, average monthly trips per customer, the majority of customers are falling into the category of taking up to 50 trips.
519346	523333	That is about 90% of the customers when we lasted the analysis.
523854	529183	And about 10% of the customers, again, fall into that 51 to 60 category.
531155	536401	So now I'm going to just remind everyone of what our initial recommendations were back in 2024.
536562	542409	As it stands today again quickly, there's a zero dollar base customer fare.
542449	544511	The trip cap is 60 per month.
545072	547215	Subsidy is up to $25 per trip.
548596	553382	It is available within the entire district and it is available 24 seven.
553362	568024	Back when we came to you in November of 2024, we had proposed making changes, and this involved having a $4.50 based customer fare, which would be $2.25 for our live eligible customers.
568605	571149	We proposed a trip cap of 40 per month.
572531	580703	The subsidy would go to $20 per trip, and then it was proposed to mirror both the current service area and the service hours.
582320	590960	With this recommendation, there were going to be cost savings that the district would realize, and that was going to be about 5.8 million dollars.
592323	600362	So instead of the projected yearly spend being a little bit over 15 million, we would go down to about 9.4.
604105	611537	Okay, and as a result of some of the feedback and comments that we've heard, we did put together two additional revised scenarios.
611657	615103	So scenario one is what I'm going to touch on first.
615323	619650	So this has to do with an increased trip cap approach.
619630	627746	So what we were proposing in this scenario is increasing the trip cap to 50 per month from the original 40 that was proposed.
628548	635682	We are proposing as this is again as we've said a premium supplemental service a fair of $6.50 per trip.
635662	640271	which would be $3.25 for our live customers.
641373	643718	Then the remainder of the proposal does remain the same.
643878	655662	We were still proposing a subsidy per trip of $20, and we are proposing mirroring the current service area and service hours as that of our accessoride program.
656468	671347	With this program, we did see actually a little bit of the yearly impact would be a cost savings of about $6.1 million, bringing our total spend to about a little over $9.1.
673150	682662	With the 50 trips, that does allow for customers to still have, given there's about 20 weekdays in a month,
682642	689698	That does allow for customers to still travel to work, but then does allow for some ancillary trips throughout the month.
692125	698693	And then another scenario that we had put together is the tiered approach that we have discussed.
699354	706863	With this approach, we would still maintain a trip cap of up to 60 trips per month, which matches what we have currently.
707824	713070	There would be a $4.50 based customer fare for up to 30 trips.
713050	719309	$5.50 for 31 to 50 and $6.50 for 51 to 60.
719951	723381	And the remainder of the recommendation would remain the same.
724762	743804	With this program, as some people have noted, due to kind of the program structure and some of the manual aspects that exist with monitoring today, there would be an increase in staff oversight that would result in additional staff headcount.
743824	749470	Again, that had been noted, but as it stands today, the program does require quite a bit of manual intervention.
750496	758554	There is also, as someone mentioned, the customers would need to be keeping a little bit closer track of their trips, and that could lead to confusion.
758594	765490	It is something a customer would have to be regularly thinking, where am I at for the month?
765510	769078	Have I hit that 30 trips so they know what to expect for their costs?
770898	775828	With this program, we would see some reductions of just over $5 million.
775908	780297	So it is a little bit less than some of the other recommendations that we've put forth.
780838	786669	And it would bring our projected yearly spend to about $10.28 million a year.
790497	791218	And actually,
792025	802662	So proposed next steps we are here as GM CEO Johnson has said to just kind of garner everyone's feedback and get some guidance on a path forward.
803203	810034	The intent is to do outreach and engagement in June based on some of that guidance and engage with the community.
810014	820690	We would be coming back for board consideration in July with an actual recommended action to the committee and then provided the committee advanced it at the board meeting.
820730	826319	And we would begin implementation in August with full implementation in October.
828141	830144	And with that, I will open it up.
831246	831667	Perfect.
832167	833890	Thank you very much for your presentation, Ms.
833950	834391	Vallejoz.
835332	837455	OK, I'm going to open it up for directors.
837796	838637	Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
839765	844551	Thank you for the presentation and the ease of absorbing the proposed changes.
845433	857930	Erin, looking at the second proposal, the tiered approach, one of our commenters talked about the complications of keeping up with number of trips.
858671	864118	Is that something that the new staff would be able to be
864098	889870	Clearinghouse if you will tour you have one call to RTD instead of calling a taxi and a lift and an Uber That seems to be the most difficult part of that I'm just curious if you think our staff would be handling that in a way that would be handy for our customers It's definitely something I think we could assist with but I do think there would still be some burden on the customer for having some of that responsibility and
890356	895925	Again, as I mentioned, as it stands today, there is just a very manual aspect of the program.
896466	904859	And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.
907082	907723	Thank you.
909526	909986	Thank you.
910127	916273	And thank you for a very clear presentation, although I have one question of clarification.
916633	919376	You talk about mirroring the existing service area.
920657	935652	One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that, um, I don't think that the customers were restricted to the three quarter mile within a fixed route.
936391	938353	Would that change with this?
938373	943198	Any of these proposals or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?
944199	953249	As the pro the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the three quarter of a mile boundary that exists today for our accessory customers.
956793	957373	Okay, that.
959976	963299	That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.
963339	963900	Thank you.
966142	967204	Secretary Nicholson.
969247	970669	Thank you very much.
971731	978081	I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.
980164	985613	We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.
986674	989719	There are commuter routes and I
989699	998215	would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.
998275	1004687	So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.
1004727	1006290	Otherwise, Peggy has like
1006962	1010689	two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.
1010709	1013836	There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.
1014818	1022052	I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of
1022673	1031729	you know, not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.
1032530	1042487	The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, you know, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.
1042467	1051493	You know, I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in Peggy's district or yours exactly.
1051513	1053017	And so.
1053638	1058545	But creating a system where the trip cap is 40 bucks doesn't work for me.
1058665	1064074	Creating a trip cap where it's 15 bucks doesn't work for the people in her district.
1064154	1075811	It strikes me that the right approach would be to have different levels of financial cap and different levels of trip cap to go along with them and let people pick.
1075931	1077874	You want 60 trips at
1078090	1079212	$15 per.
1079673	1079914	Great.
1079974	1082539	You want 50 trips at $20 per.
1082679	1082900	Great.
1082960	1085906	You want 40 trips at $30 per.
1086266	1086507	Great.
1086567	1087669	Depends on where you live.
1087689	1089633	Depends on the types of trips you're going to be taking.
1089693	1099693	But making people all fit into one size is either going to leave her people paying $20 for every single trip that they take.
1099673	1108772	or it's going to put people in my district in a reduced number of rides because very few trips are going to cost $20 or $25.
1109032	1111076	So those are my two pieces of feedback.
1111096	1111397	Thank you.
1113581	1114363	Thank you, Secretary.
1115165	1115826	Director Ruscha.
1120480	1121161	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
1122322	1126726	So I just wanted to offer a bit of context.
1126887	1131792	And the general manager, please interrupt me if I'm framing this wrong.
1132172	1138459	But the conversation that we're having tonight is a framework of a potential path forward.
1139139	1145526	And because of our OSS meeting went so long,
1145506	1152034	we weren't able to get to through the discussion and that also I think impacted our ability to have some interim discussions.
1152074	1175344	So I just want folks to you know keep keep an open mind to what staff is saying and definitely share that feedback because we're on a timeline but also just recognize that well and please if I'm saying the strong introduction but what is being presented is a concept framework and so we want so we'll get more feedback and then of course staff is going to be working very closely
1175662	1183093	with our existing customers and advocacy organizations to make further refinements and give us some more stuff to look at.
1183154	1190285	So I hope I didn't speak out of turn, but I just wanted to offer that for context.
1191026	1203525	And I'm also listening and taking notes and I know staff is, so I would just urge if anyone has thoughts one way or another, please share them tonight since we are also on
1203809	1207758	timeline with our existing partners and those contracts as well.
1207798	1208159	Thank you.
1209281	1209923	Thank you, Director.
1210724	1211406	Director Larson.
1215054	1215495	Thank you.
1215595	1217940	I just have a question for Ms.
1217980	1218441	Vallejos.
1219744	1223252	So I saw I seen one of those slot these slides that it says there's
1223536	1232065	In December of 2024, there were about 2,900 total active customers of access on demand.
1233127	1238292	So there were 2,900 people, roughly, who used it in all of December.
1239073	1239574	Is that right?
1240915	1243518	I know that would be for the year, I believe.
1244599	1245280	Let me just.
1245420	1245941	OK.
1245961	1250946	So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year.
1251227	1251687	That's it.
1252578	1265271	And so I guess what I'm trying to just understand is, if we were going to spend, say, $10 million or $15 million on 2,900 people,
1265740	1270807	What do we think the equivalent is for just our regular riders?
1271107	1272048	Do we have any guess?
1272669	1275032	I mean, I know people have different ridership.
1275072	1289430	If we have a million customers a year and it's the majority of our budget, I'm just trying to get a sense of how the per-person spend for a regular rider compares to the per-person spend for access on demand.
1291713	1293756	Go ahead, Deborah.
1295542	1299048	So if I can, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question.
1299309	1301753	I would not want us to conjecture and speculate.
1301814	1303617	We could double back and give you those numbers.
1304519	1310249	As we talk about, you use the term regular writer, you're talking about those that are using fixed route service.
1310269	1313415	I just want to be clear and intentional with the language we're using going forward.
1313395	1322188	So we need to assess that because it's a different level of service because with fixed route bus, we're not providing curb to curb service.
1322528	1326454	And so we can double back and share that information with the board.
1327395	1331521	But I think it wouldn't be fruitful for us to guesstimate because this is critically important.
1331882	1337390	But as we come back and we have some guidance, we could provide that detailed information, if you will.
1337790	1338131	Thank you.
1340113	1341175	Thank you.
1342505	1344588	Any other directors comments?
1344608	1345409	Yeah, director Guzman.
1346351	1353882	So I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area.
1356365	1360311	District C is fairly blessed with
1360713	1369686	multiple forms of transit and fixed route, where this is not a particular problem, but it is an issue in the suburban areas of the region.
1370127	1383767	And it is highly concerning that we would restrict it so much where people would be left off of the system that live within a quarter mile of a commuter bus and still not be able to access this.
1386262	1398596	I also think that as we proceed into the future after the demographers presentation to the finance and planning committee, a big concern will be our aging population in the region.
1399478	1404624	And it's a, you know, somebody said that this is a drop in the bucket for our budget.
1405845	1416117	Maybe right now, but eventually this is going to catch up with us, which is why we're having this conversation and access on demand and folks that are able to
1416451	1430934	or out of need, utilize this system, need to be considered as humans first and how we serve them, which is our mission, right?
1430954	1432637	They need connection as well.
1433107	1446549	and not every one of them will be able to jump from a, jump, roll, walk, shuffle to a fixed route form of transportation to get them to their destinations.
1447511	1454081	I have a question about the time on this, right?
1454542	1459350	If it's mirroring regular service provision for the whole region,
1460579	1468370	It kind of makes sense, but I would still be concerned for the reasons that emergencies don't happen on RTD schedule.
1469371	1478384	And so somebody who already has a specific need for this type of transportation usage might need to go to the doctor.
1478924	1481608	And what do they do if they're unable to drive?
1482128	1492688	And regular bus service is not something that they can use because the buses aren't running a two o'clock in the morning emergency room visit is not unheard of and not uncommon in anybody's life.
1493249	1496014	And yet what do we do to take care of those that are most vulnerable.
1497397	1500643	So for me, I would really want to see some clarity around
1501028	1502050	those two areas.
1503191	1508700	I am frankly less concerned about minimal difference of cost savings.
1509621	1512145	I mean, we're talking $5 million.
1512185	1518295	That's not really the top priority for me on that part.
1518680	1543557	right now it will eventually get there because this will likely continue to grow but I do want to make sure that we are basing ourselves in reality to serve the taxpayers needs and this is a need right this is not a desire as some of the other services we want to grow and create are this one is an actual need and so I want to be clear in my language on that and why I'm
1544566	1546914	depositing these comments within that framework.
1547255	1548479	So that would be my feedback.
1548499	1552994	I'd like to see something a little bit different on those two things, the service area and the time for service.
1553175	1553476	Thank you.
1554058	1554760	Thank you, Director.
1555443	1556145	Director Harwick.
1557138	1559422	Well, thank you, Director Guzman.
1559442	1561746	I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you just said.
1561766	1571162	I represent Arvada, and Arvada is actually the fastest growing aging population.
1571362	1572564	However, I said that.
1572645	1573506	I'm not sure I said it right.
1574167	1579637	And a lot of our service is not in the areas where we have those aging people.
1580198	1582842	So I'd really like to see
1583395	1585438	just the boundary kept the same.
1585558	1590484	I'm also really again with director Guzman keeping it as a full 24 seven.
1590504	1606905	I just like I have a friend in a wheelchair and I just think about her trying like if she didn't live where she lived if she lived where I live she would have such a difficult time getting you know around her community and I won't just
1607408	1612899	especially like if the service is outside of that time period, it's just precluding her life.
1612959	1624101	And I know we don't all have these, the same abilities when we're riding the bus, but for a person with disability that's blind or in a wheelchair, I think that we can sort of extend them the grace that they deserve.
1625009	1627453	I also would like to see the cap stay at 60.
1627613	1640816	I think that, again, I know that it's a, you know, less than 10% of the population go above the 50 rides, but I think it's still like that's, we're giving them access to a free and full life.
1641878	1650072	And I think if we are gonna go with the 650, I think that that to me is fine, but I also think that it would be imperative that we really,
1650052	1677561	put out the live program and let let those writers know That there is another option like there's always with someone the other day she Lives about three miles away from where she works and you know She can afford it, but just barely and she didn't know about the live program So I think that there's we're missing an opportunity there specifically with these With these writers so and then my last one is just a request is it possible to get a map of
1677541	1692317	like sort of like a density map of where AOD is like highly being used to sort of go with that, like thinking about, you know, West Jefferson County versus central Denver, just kind of see what that looks like.
1692417	1699605	Obviously we want to anonymize the data, but I think it's sort of just would be interesting for us to know where the sort of hotspots of usage are.
1699645	1700906	Thank you.
1700946	1701667	Thank you, Director Harwick.
1701867	1702028	Ms.
1702048	1702468	Johnson.
1703478	1721897	Yes, Director Harwick, if I understood you correctly, because I'm taking copious notes here, you are in support for all intents and purposes of what I hear, the modification of scenario one, keeping it at 60 trips with 650 and then one information relative to what the current usage is from a geographic vantage point.
1722397	1723178	Okay, thank you.
1724439	1725060	Thank you.
1725080	1729144	Yeah, but I also want to keep the service areas the same as they are today.
1729664	1731967	Yeah.
1731987	1732287	Excellent.
1733549	1735493	Director Nicholson, then Director Ruscha.
1737036	1740702	Yeah, just a quick follow-up onto that.
1741684	1749058	When it comes to go to Director Ruscha, my brain, I lost my train of thought for a second, so.
1750341	1751102	Alright, Director Ruscha.
1755908	1757110	Thank you for the red rover.
1757171	1757972	I wasn't prepared.
1757992	1758874	I went back to my notes.
1759375	1759796	Okay.
1759816	1774305	So, um, anyway, I, um, so I, some of this, um, feedback I did share with staff and I, um, I don't want to be repetitive, but I also just want to be really transparent with my, my colleagues, uh, because we haven't had this public conversation yet.
1774758	1792084	And just high level, some of the things that I had shared was, you know, first of all, we don't want to put one proposal out before the community and get feedback like the one that we've had out for several months and then come back with something else that looks like less than what we originally proposed.
1792185	1795129	And so one of the pain points that I had was just the idea of
1795430	1799337	going up to 650 for the initial fare because that's not what we originally put out there.
1799678	1810558	So one of the things that I urge is that if we put an offer on the table, so to speak, we don't take it back.
1810958	1812601	That's kind of our baseline now.
1813363	1818552	And another piece of feedback I had is that where something is not
1820337	1832897	For every change we make, which essentially results in a reduction of a service of some kind or an increase in price, we really have to justify that line by line.
1833277	1841731	So for example, if we decide that we are going to strictly align with service hours, then we have to justify it.
1841891	1843233	It doesn't cost us any more money.
1843393	1844415	It's not going to save us a penny.
1844856	1848201	If somebody, you know, uses on demand,
1849008	1853458	15 or 20 minutes or an hour before fixed drought starts.
1855102	1860013	Likewise, it's not costing us that I could see a lot of money, if any.
1860415	1864880	for us to offer service outside of our general service area.
1865961	1868864	I know that was flagged in the peer review.
1869184	1888164	So I, because this idea has been on the table for so many months, I also want to caution us about the service area idea because if we restrict the service, that means there are people who currently are using AOD and they're going to lose it.
1888885	1889325	So
1890267	1900961	I, um, so that was just, I mean, that was just the, the kind of like high level, like, um, theme that I had in, in the feedback.
1901602	1914840	Um, and also, you know, I'm going back to the, uh, initial like a fair, um, we also want to be really careful about what we think.
1915192	1918378	is inexpensive because it's really relative.
1918418	1937892	So for some folks using the service and they have like a fixed income or very limited income, if we even do you know 450 which would be parity with excess ride and I think I could accept that but like say we go up to 650 or we do this tiered system
1938445	1946853	then for some folks, they are not going to be able to write or they're going to be choosing, do I get to the doctor or do I buy food for tonight?
1947013	1950717	So I just wanted to put that out there.
1951117	1960907	And finally, well, actually, I'll stop there.
1960927	1968334	I concurred with what a lot of other directors said in terms of keeping the program as is as much as we can.
1969023	1981228	I think that, but I also just want to commend staff, you know, because we are at a much different place than where we were several months ago.
1981869	1983673	This is a totally different conversation.
1984396	1985957	really slashing this program.
1986738	1992203	And staff did a lot of work and we spent several months, we almost voted on this a few months ago.
1992243	2001110	And they listened to us as directors and they listened to community because as you know, we've had hundreds of public comments over several months on this.
2001751	2009618	And they said, okay, we can take a timeout, we can reassess, we can get some different data, we can, you know, kind of present a new paradigm.
2009638	2013441	So again, what's before us today is a sketch of ideas, the feedback is good.
2013691	2018728	But I really do want to commend staff for listening and working with us in partnership.
2018748	2019671	So thank you.
2019691	2021076	And thank you.
2022280	2023143	Thank you, Director Ruscha.
2023323	2024046	Director Nicholson.
2025431	2026755	Thank you.
2028119	2042977	Is there any step during enrollment of AAR and AOD where we ask people if they are enrolled in the live program and ask them, hey, we're taking 14 other pieces of documentation from you.
2042997	2046982	I mean, AAR is remarkably complicated to sign up for.
2047723	2053911	Is there any part of that process where we try to enroll them in the live program as well?
2053951	2055072	And then I have a quick follow up.
2059844	2062427	I will have to find out about that as part of the process.
2062828	2067734	Um, and we will confirm if that is, you know, how that is handled as, as part of the process.
2068855	2069075	Yeah.
2069155	2079448	So, yeah, as a, as a first thing I would say that since we're going to be updating this to offer the, the live discount and, and not make it free, uh, it should be required as part of the process.
2079508	2087978	If you're going through to sign up for AOD or AAR, some point in that process to set, to ask someone to affirm that they are either already signed up or,
2088228	2092593	haven't signed up or whatever, and then give them the opportunity to make it super easy.
2092653	2099220	Because we only have 15,000 people signed up for live right now, and we have 180 something thousand boardings every day.
2099340	2105888	And I think only about half the people in AOD are currently signed up for, or AAR currently signed up for live.
2105908	2108291	So definitely something I'd like to see there.
2108331	2117661	The second thing, I want to echo what Director Ruscha said about the effect on people who
2118215	2134300	are low income to having these fares, but I want to take it from the other side, which is if you don't have a lot of money and you need to get around to a lot of places, then 40 trips maybe, or whatever the number ends up being, not nearly enough in a way that someone who makes more money
2134280	2137643	can probably have some discretionary to be like, oh, I've run out of trips.
2137723	2140966	I can afford to take an extra three or five or whatever.
2140986	2145110	So I'm not sure that that needs to be fit into the policy here.
2145170	2147712	I'm wary about trying to do too much too quickly.
2148033	2158522	But I do think we need to get a report from you after, I don't know, six months a year that looks at how many trips are people on live using?
2158763	2159744	Are they maxing out?
2160184	2162346	Or are we seeing sort of the same curve?
2162326	2175021	from live users as we do from regular users right now, and that might inform us to take action a year from now to try to offer the right service for people who need it.
2175062	2177104	Some live people make decent incomes.
2177284	2184653	Some of them are literally broke, and we need to recognize that those two groups of people have very different lived experiences.
2185374	2186215	Thank you, Secretary.
2186315	2186475	Ms.
2186515	2186856	Johnson?
2187236	2190240	Yes, thank you very much, Director Nicholson.
2190372	2193095	Mr. Chair, thank you, Director Nicholson, for the comments.
2193555	2210174	And what I will say in reference to your request, it appeared to be a directive, but I would just offer this up to you that once we collectively agree upon the path forward in this Board acts, we can then assess what might be most prudent, because at this point in time, we don't know what we don't know.
2210194	2215980	And relative to what you just asked, I can't commit to that without knowing what we intend to do.
2216140	2217882	So I just had to say that for the record.
2218081	2219102	because it seemed as if Ms.
2219162	2222767	Baleos was giving direction, and I don't think that's appropriate at this juncture.
2223067	2223527	Thank you.
2225009	2225330	Thank you.
2225350	2225410	Ms.
2225430	2226010	Director Larson.
2227752	2228193	Thank you.
2228213	2234761	I was just kind of doing some stuff on my calculator.
2234881	2245253	And so if we only have 3,000 people who use excess on demand, I mean, it seems like the disabled population
2245570	2251456	You know, it might be 300,000 people in Denver or something, you know, much, much larger.
2252937	2259504	Do we, how do, how confident are we of our projection that it'll stay at around, I mean, or, or however much we think it'll increase?
2259524	2271055	I mean, what do we think the total number of active users might become and why won't it become, you know, several, many multiples more than 3,000 or so?
2276671	2285481	First, if I may, just for everyone's identification, you probably have heard this over the course of several months in the public comment discussions.
2286182	2301379	When we talk about access on demand, currently as it's configured, recognizing that we're using private entities, transportation network companies in particular, not all of the vehicles are outfitted to be wheelchair accessible.
2301646	2309435	So that's a critical element when we're talking about the population because there's different disabilities that individuals have.
2309515	2316404	Some may have cognitive, somebody may be using a mobility device, which can't be accommodated going forward.
2316424	2319347	So I just wanted to provide that context prior to Ms.
2319367	2324233	Vallejo's answering the question because that has not been factored into this conversation this evening.
2324253	2325655	And I believe it's a germane point.
2327677	2328278	Thank you, Director.
2328781	2333165	And I don't think I need to add anything that was really exactly what I was going to say.
2333225	2338851	Not everyone is able to use the access on demand service that is eligible for excessive ride.
2339251	2340633	Other is a difference there.
2341293	2342214	Can I just follow up?
2342234	2349161	But I mean, surely many more people than 3000 in the metro area would be eligible though.
2350682	2355447	Well, and again, we have continued continue to see substantial growth.
2355865	2360290	in the number of customers that are beginning to use the service.
2360751	2367620	Again, the trips that we are seeing continue to grow even into this year, so we are seeing quite significant growth still.
2370763	2371084	Thank you.
2371264	2371584	Thank you.
2372385	2372686	Thank you.
2373927	2375389	Any further questions, comments?
2377632	2377812	Ms.
2377872	2378613	Johnson and Ms.
2378633	2380636	Vallejoz, thank you very much for the presentation.
2380676	2382959	I hope this was helpful feedback for going forward.
2383419	2384100	So thank you.
2384722	2385824	Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.
2385864	2388708	This was in the sense that we do have some guidance now.
2388748	2391733	We know what we need to do as we do further outreach.
2391773	2394156	So thank you all very much for the opportunity.
2394677	2404352	And when we come back in July with a recommended action, hopefully we can all rally around that, recognizing the public comments that we heard in the direction in which you provide it.
2404372	2404732	Thank you.
2405013	2405313	Thank you.
2405814	2406395	Director Guzman.
2406795	2410181	Will that recommended action be going through operation safety and security?
2411923	2412063	Ms.
2412103	2412484	Johnson.
2412785	2414751	Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
2414811	2417318	And thank you, Director Guzman.
2417599	2419706	I apologize for the question.
2420006	2422614	Most definitely we will go through the committee procedure.
2422634	2425282	The only reason why this didn't happen because it's time sensitive.
2425703	2426305	So thank you.
2426977	2427678	Thank you very much.
2428899	2429220	All right.
2429300	2430381	Well, thank you again, Ms.
2430421	2430862	Filaios.
2431823	2432104	All right.
2432384	2432925	Moving on.
2432985	2435268	Thank you, directors, for the questions and conversations.
2435568	2441716	We're going to be moving to our committee reports, not, not to be the, the time police or anything.
2441756	2445201	We are at 8 31 PM and we've been going at this since 3 30.
2445761	2449486	If committee reports could be less than a minute, that'd be greatly appreciated.
2450107	2452270	Audit committee chair music.
2452290	2453271	What would you like to share?
2454213	2455014	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
2455054	2456676	We did not meet in April or May.
2456716	2458518	Our next meeting is June 12, 2025.
2459098	2460200	That concludes my report.
2460580	2461281	Thank you.
2461301	2461981	Thank you very much.
2463944	2466386	Finance and Planning Committee Report, Committee Chair Guzman.
2466807	2467467	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
2468669	2476217	The Finance and Planning Committee met Tuesday, May 13th, discussed a handful of items, received a report from our state demographer, which was really awesome.
2476958	2483545	Directors are reminded to email the board office if you had any follow-up questions or things specific to your sub-district so we can send that all at once.
2483660	2485122	to receive an answer to the whole board.
2485823	2494014	Received an update from DOTI for the East Colfax BRT and three items came out of committee, which will be before us tonight.
2495776	2507071	Just want to thank the committee for all of the hard work and the next meeting for the finance and planning committee is scheduled for Tuesday, June 10th at 5.30 PM.
2507212	2507592	Thank you.
2508652	2509316	Thank you, Director.
2510504	2515135	Committee Chair Ruscio or Committee Chair Harwick, what would you like to share for OSS?
2516110	2516711	I'll take it, sir.
2517653	2517973	Thank you.
2518033	2520798	So we met remotely on Wednesday, May 14th.
2521640	2524204	We gaveled in at 5.34 p.m.
2524405	2526829	and wrapped up at 9.44 p.m.
2527490	2529714	We had extensive public comments.
2529874	2532219	The most I've ever seen at any OSS meeting.
2533240	2533781	That was great.
2533881	2535104	Come visit us anytime.
2536166	2540413	It's always nice to know that people are listening to our podcast and by that I mean our YouTube channel.
2540393	2563279	But two major items that went on the consent calendar for tonight's meeting is the 2025-2028 Title VI program update, just ensuring that we stay in compliance with federal law, civil rights protections, and meet the needs of our customers, as well as the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension.
2563259	2568224	FNP authorized a budget transfer, which had no financial impact.
2568344	2570247	It was just moving from one department to another.
2570287	2578996	And then we filed that up with a vote to extend that contract for another year with the cost of up to just a little over 22 million.
2579777	2583240	And we did have four discussion items, two of which were heard.
2584282	2588406	So we had the Vision Zero update from GM CEO Johnson.
2588842	2593869	As you might recall, we passed a Vision Zero resolution last year, and so that planning process is underway.
2594690	2596932	We had a customer communications update.
2597653	2608167	Stuart Summers led an excellent presentation, discussing how we handle communications, some tech updates, customer service aspects.
2608147	2611492	real-time information and service alerts and things like that.
2612253	2619585	Unfortunately, we did hit our four-hour mark before we could finish our agenda items, and even though the nuggets weren't playing, folks wanted to go, and we were tired.
2620186	2631403	So we moved the on-demand item to the nice meeting, which we just heard, and then we'll be hearing Paratransit Legacy Customer Protection's proposal next month.
2631383	2643481	So for those of you who have been tracking what we're doing with paratransit, I strongly encourage you to come visit us at OSSX month and weigh in so we get your feedback before we come back with something more final.
2644383	2653016	Our next meeting is Wednesday, June 11th at 5.30, same time, same place, online or on the phone.
2653797	2654097	Thank you.
2654558	2655940	Thank you, committee chair.
2656375	2659039	Uh, now to for performance committee chair Guzman.
2659460	2660060	I get it.
2660721	2661623	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
2662043	2663886	Performance committee met Monday, May 12th, 2025.
2663926	2679649	Uh, I, I, the, the committee chair presented a draft proposal that I had worked on previously with vice chair Gucci and Ritter for the 2025 general manager, CEO performance assessment form and process that needed to be updated to seek input from the committee and other directors.
2679629	2692120	to find a way forward for the rest of the year based on the current 2025 general manager CO short term goals and the respective adjustments made to the scoring points based on our votes in January.
2692640	2694002	I've received some feedback.
2694183	2697449	I continue to invite directors to submit the feedback.
2697489	2699432	If you have not reviewed that meeting, please do so.
2700013	2702718	And any questions you may have, please email me or call me.
2703019	2705283	I am happy to engage in that conversation.
2706064	2714479	Of course, we are doing that with participation and a lot of communication with the general manager CEO, Deborah Johnson.
2714847	2720033	The next meeting of the performance committee is scheduled for June 2, 2025 at 8.30 a.m.
2720613	2725799	I really want to encourage all of you, directors, to please participate in that meeting.
2726540	2727041	Two reasons.
2727201	2728362	One, we are going to receive.
2729483	2735990	I hope I don't get this wrong because I don't have my work plan in front of me, but the employee survey results in the beginning of that meeting.
2736111	2738273	And then we will adjourn into executive session.
2738607	2743333	for the second quarterly one-on-one opportunity with our general manager CEO.
2743874	2757713	And that is part of our contracted agreement with the general manager CEO to receive information from her and provide feedback regarding personnel matters.
2759127	2766416	Additionally, the performance committee is set to have a second meeting in June because of that quarterly check-in.
2767357	2772243	The second meeting is planned, I believe, for June 23rd at 8.30 a.m.
2772263	2781754	And that is in order to do a deep dive into our community and customer surveys, which align with our community value and customer excellent strategic initiatives.
2782315	2786400	And I would again encourage all directors to participate in that meeting as well.
2786752	2793682	which is the overview of the current status of the agency's surveys and where we're at with regard to public.
2794102	2801893	It will inform the process for setting goals and priorities for the 2026 year, which we are also doing all at the same time.
2802094	2815813	So prioritizing what is important for our customers, the survey reports are a great opportunity to engage with direct feedback from our constituents in all areas of the agency.
2816266	2822801	I do believe a little birdie has told me on one of the buses that these should be really positive discussions.
2823462	2833023	So if you need more than that invitation, please signal tonight and I will call you and email you and hound you to be on these meetings because I think they're really important for all of us.
2833063	2833785	Thank you.
2834288	2835591	Thank you committee chair goes on.
2836432	2837234	All right, moving on.
2838055	2845430	We're going to do the approval of board meeting minutes and committee reports, the board and committee meeting minutes were included in the board packet.
2846151	2850299	Are there any corrections from the board for the minutes to be approved this evening.
2853506	2854187	Any corrections.
2855568	2855909	All right.
2856249	2862739	Unless there's objection to considering the minutes all the same time, my please have a motion to approve the minutes for the following meetings.
2863380	2874977	The April 9th, 2025 operation safety and security committee, the April 29th, 2025 board meeting, the May 12th, 2025 performance committee, May 13th, 2025 finance and planning committee.
2875801	2881987	May 14th, 2025, Operation Safety and Security Committee, and then May 22nd, 2025, Executive Committee.
2882388	2883248	So moved, Guzman.
2883589	2884670	I have the Guzman.
2885591	2886812	Second.
2886832	2887112	Second.
2887293	2888314	I'm going to give it to Guzman.
2891697	2895521	So I heard Director Guzman as the mover and Director Guzman as the second.
2895661	2897102	Is there any discussion on this motion?
2901767	2902388	Okay.
2902408	2904029	Seeing none, I'll now call the vote.
2904189	2905791	Are there any no votes on this action?
2908319	2912850	It'll pass 14, zero, and one absent.
2914574	2914955	Excellent.
2915657	2915978	All right.
2916018	2920549	Moving on, it will be our chairs report.
2920950	2926463	Due to the late hour, I will be quoting my principal and saying, I am giving you all the gift of time.
2926713	2935524	And all I can say with my chair's report is we will have a border treat on June 7th talking about our 2026 priorities for the agency.
2936125	2938628	Again, directors, hopefully you all can make that.
2938668	2943274	It'll be a very healthy discussion, a very hearty discussion, I guarantee.
2943755	2946238	But please make sure you have that marked down on your calendars.
2946738	2947219	Thank you.
2950827	2953209	Did you want to remind everybody about the survey we sent you?
2953229	2954210	Of course, thank you.
2954631	2961557	And of course, directors, you'll see in my weekly update, there was a survey that might have been passed too.
2962037	2964560	And if you've not filled out that survey, please do so.
2965000	2968223	Thank you for the directors who did fill it in.
2968443	2970265	So that's okay.
2970365	2976451	If we could get that in by Monday morning, that'd be excellent.
2976491	2978272	I'll include that in my weekly update though.
2978473	2978893	Thank you.
2980139	2984505	I'll give it now over to you, GMCO Johnson.
2984525	2998385	Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and by to recognize the lateness of the hour, I just have a couple of elements that I'll share with you that are in alignment with our activities and strategic endeavors since our last board meeting on Tuesday, April 29th.
3000308	3009100	One notable aspect is the legislative conference held by the American Public Transportation Association from May 18th through the 20th.
3009451	3022069	In Washington DC, just for everyone's edification, this annual conference is an opportunity for public transportation industry professionals across the nation to visit Washington DC and connect with policymakers, implementers, and their staffs.
3022750	3033045	The conference helps educate and inform active members on important federal legislation and policy initiatives and affords an unparalleled opportunity to shape the industry's positions in federal advocacy agenda.
3033515	3044527	I along with directors of Keith Chandler and Guchin Ritter and government relations officer Michael Davies attended conference sessions and meetings with members of Colorado's congressional delegation and their staffs.
3044547	3060045	While chairing an APTA committee meeting on Sunday, May 8th, I personally engaged with Tariq Bakari who is the acting administrator of the Federal Transit Administration who shared his views and inputs as it relates to public transit as well as the importance of federal and local partnerships.
3060498	3067786	Just yesterday, Tuesday, May 27th, I along with members of my team met with individuals representing the Alliance to Transform Transportation.
3068547	3073933	As you may be aware, it's a coalition of groups on transit related matters in Colorado.
3074573	3089830	Alliance representatives in attendance included Executive Director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Danny Katz, or Co-Purg, as we refer to it, Jill Lockenture, Executive Director of the Denver Streets Partnership, Portia Prescott, President of the Rocky Mountain NAACP,
3090215	3097980	uh, branch, uh, the state conference representing Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming, Dennis Hawkins representing the amalgamated transit union 10 01.
3098382	3106715	Matt Fromer representing Transportation and Land Use, well, he is the Transportation and Land Use Policy Manager from the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project.
3107175	3111582	The meeting really was focused on Alliance's vision for transit in the Denver region.
3112403	3120255	As you know, they have been very vocal in which they're seeking to increase funding for transit in the Denver region by $420 million per year.
3120539	3126311	to bolster the frequency and availability of transit services in the metro area.
3128335	3141383	From RTD's perspective, questions were posed relative to how that $420 million figure was derived and they explained how that came about with the work they had done with the third party entity.
3141599	3146569	of very bare bones relative to providing some information.
3147110	3162983	And then we talked about the agency's focus, which all of you are very well aware that we are laser focused on asset renewal, state of good repair, and rightsizing transit service and alignment with RTD's branded comprehensive operational analysis being the system optimization plan.
3163823	3177801	Related to personal security, as was recently reported, RTD experienced a 60% reduction in security-related calls for service, as well as a three-year decrease in reports of criminal activities between 2022 and 2025 at Denver Union Station.
3177841	3192379	The decrease is representative of concerted efforts to restore and maintain a welcoming transit environment within the critical multi-modal transit hub, and following a collaborative and multifaceted strategy aimed at enhancing
3192730	3197755	personal safety and security through crime prevention through environmental design methodologies.
3198115	3204121	This effort would have not have been a success without the commitment of numerous agency employees as well as support from the city and county of Denver.
3205482	3214311	It's police department, the downtown Denver partnerships, Sage hospitality, the lower Denver neighborhood association, as well as several local businesses and downtown Denver residents.
3214851	3221117	Fair enforcement has also increased in recent months, which is the result of RTDs growing ranks of sworn police officers
3221435	3236093	haven't been trained to perform this function alongside the contracted team that we have in security with Allied Universal personnel who had primarily been responsible for this responsibility.
3236614	3244624	I look forward to sharing additional details regarding the impacts of these efforts during the June Performance Committee, which you heard Committee Chair Guzman reference.
3244908	3251398	When I along with staff will present data related to annual customer community and employee surveys that have recently concluded.
3251439	3272232	On a related note, the agency has proactively increased its transit police officer presence at Denver Union Station and across the agency's downtown Denver sector to support the personal safety and security of customers and visitors attending major events and activity, notably as we know, while we're no longer in the hockey playoffs and NBA, but
3272701	3276885	people had a welcoming experience in and around our facilities.
3277326	3288898	And RTD PD had increased patrols at Denver Union Station and bus stops and rail stations, the high of, before the high profile events, which included the playoff games I just referenced.
3288918	3293543	And this coincides with increasing Denver police patrols throughout the downtown area.
3294184	3301071	And RTD and DPD are working closely to collaborate to support enhanced safety for the traveling public.
3303194	3315850	And moreover, data and metrics related to personal safety and security are now conveniently located on the recently created security related metrics page, and we've actually showcased that on other social media channels as well.
3317092	3329708	As it relates to our customer excellence in relation to the strategic priorities of customer excellence and employee ownership, I shared yesterday with the board the last of the 31 light rail speed restrictions put into place last year on the DH
3330228	3332932	and E and R lines was lifted as of yesterday morning.
3334013	3338539	I want to give a special shout out to our maintenance of way teams that have done yeoman's work.
3338559	3348253	The final speed restriction, which was approximately 400 feet in southbound segment north of south more station and was removed after crews completed those repairs.
3350977	3360049	Keeping in mind those rigorous restrictions were put into place due to the fact that we enhanced our inspections of track
3360451	3365917	back in May 2024 as an enhanced focus on maintaining the agency's assets and a state of good repair.
3366417	3370181	At the time, you know, crews found several minor issues and track imperfections.
3370621	3382994	So as I said before, I thank and congratulate all the agency employees who worked tirelessly over the course of these 11 months.
3383294	3386998	And like I said, a special shout out to MOW.
3388683	3403228	I would be remiss if I didn't state that while this is a cost to celebrate, I shared previously as we look at our infrastructure and it continues to age, this will be par for the course, but since we're ahead of where we were before, we will see less of an impact, I'm certain.
3404049	3411822	And last, but certainly not least, I'm pleased to welcome RTD's new Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who's in the audience, she's given a wave.
3412139	3414021	who began her tenure on May 12th.
3414342	3419348	And this is her in her first in-person board meeting while we introduced her at the Finance and Planning Committee.
3420209	3422672	You guys are real people, not figments of our imagination.
3422692	3424415	So I wanted to ensure I did that here.
3424475	3429942	So with that, I will yield the floor so we can move on to the rest of the matters that we have before.
3429962	3431564	So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
3434307	3436089	Thank you, GMCO Johnson.
3436970	3439834	Any comments or questions for GMCO Johnson?
3443003	3443404	Yeah.
3448410	3449071	Very exciting.
3449411	3450953	And Kelly, welcome to the team.
3451474	3451834	Thank you.
3454658	3455038	All right.
3455559	3456280	Moving on.
3456300	3459364	Uh, they, we're going to move on to unanimous consent.
3459764	3470057	Uh, there are three items on the unanimous consent agenda listed under section 16 actions A through C. Those items are the security operations budget transfer.
3470273	3477692	The 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, and the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension for one year.
3477712	3485532	I do understand that Director Banker would like to offer some amendments to Item B, the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update.
3485950	3491237	And such I will remove, I will move that to a recommended actions, actions, excuse me.
3491817	3500728	If anyone else has a change to discussion on or questions about any of the remaining unanimous consent items, please feel free to advise the chair at this time.
3501109	3506656	And I'll of course be happy to pull the item from unanimous consent for consideration under recommended action.
3507757	3508498	Director Nicholson.
3510721	3513484	The Allied Universal Security Contract, please pull that.
3514085	3514185	Okay.
3514537	3520383	So item B will be removed and placed into recommended action.
3521444	3527771	Excuse me, former item C, as I look in real time here, the Allied Universal Security.
3527971	3531635	Are we okay with security operations, budget transfer?
3536080	3540505	I would move to approve the remainder of the unanimous consent agenda.
3540885	3541506	Second.
3541672	3544635	Okay, I have Whitmore and then Roush as the second.
3545636	3566078	Okay, so this is item A for the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $3,845,437.10 between Operated Expenses Lines for Transit Security Services.
3568640	3571223	Is there any no votes on that?
3573548	3573848	Okay.
3575470	3577954	Seeing none, that item will pass 14-0-1.
3577974	3584602	All right, now we're moving on to our recommended action items.
3585363	3591471	And we're gonna have first on our list, the Allied Universal Security Surface Contract Extension for one year.
3591511	3594295	Is there a motion?
3595296	3595697	So moved.
3596117	3596738	Okay, Nicholson.
3598135	3598576	In a second.
3599637	3600077	And Russia.
3601800	3602040	All right.
3602220	3602941	Any discussion.
3604122	3604723	Director Nicholson.
3605384	3605564	Yeah.
3605584	3608968	So I just have a quick question about this one that came from a constituent.
3610570	3617759	How many people do we have working from working on our security side from Allied?
3618260	3622906	And how many do we have from, you know, RTDPD right now?
3623727	3624007	Thank you.
3625248	3625389	Ms.
3625409	3625729	Johnson.
3626333	3629765	Yes, I will yield the floor to Chief Martin Gano who can address that question.
3629805	3630146	Thank you.
3632736	3633458	Chief Martin Gano.
3634535	3637481	I am trying to figure out whether we're going to be hot chat for me.
3638322	3638683	Yes.
3638703	3638923	Yeah.
3638943	3644214	So technically, in regards to how many ally personnel, it's an hourly contract.
3644554	3647520	So you'd have to take the amount of the hours and obviously divided by 40.
3648181	3651848	It roughly equates to the recommended action for next year.
3651868	3653812	I think it's about 9100 hours.
3653872	3656998	So roughly equates about 180 security officers.
3656978	3662706	Right now we currently have 87 on our staff in regards to post certified police officers.
3663046	3668453	We have a couple in training and one in the academy who should be probably about 90 by the end of next month.
3669955	3670796	Thank you, secretary.
3673760	3675202	This is for GMCO Johnson.
3676023	3678767	What are there any.
3680249	3684837	plans in place or is and please feel free to not answer this as we can't.
3685959	3692070	But I know there's been a drawdown over the last few years in our reliance on allied security.
3692110	3698882	Is there anything in this contract or in your planning around this contract or.
3698862	3713822	anything that can give us guidance on whether we expect that to continue after authorizing this, or are we expecting to stay at, you know, 90, 90 something hundred or 180 people over the next few years?
3714843	3715084	Yes.
3715524	3716806	Thank you very much for the question.
3716946	3720972	As chief indicated, this is a contract extension and there's hours that are specified.
3721072	3726439	Hence, in reference to the dollar amount that we have here, I would have to come back to the board.
3726824	3732632	as it relates to any type of authorization as we're doing now currently with this contract extension, if that were to be modified.
3732873	3750197	So on this point in time, it would stay the same unless there's some extenuating circumstances whereby we go out for a solicitation and we're not able to ensure that we're meeting the timeline before, since that's why we're here now with the contract extension quite naturally in doing so.
3750278	3754063	We have to ensure that we have the appropriate staffing levels.
3754398	3759584	So, I'm talking around and around in circles right now, but the answer would be no at this point in time.
3761165	3761546	Secretary.
3763668	3764729	Perfect.
3765170	3766091	Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
3767172	3773519	So, Chief, jog my memory on our goal for the end of the year for sworn officers.
3773599	3774800	It's not 90, right?
3774820	3776302	It's continuing to grow.
3776862	3777503	Chief Morrigano.
3777601	3779584	Yeah, so we are budgeted for 150.
3780024	3782667	We're still in the process of growing to those numbers.
3784310	3790858	So obviously with applications, background checks, everything else, we're heading positively to that.
3790918	3792880	We're putting in more in the academy here in June.
3792941	3795404	We'll continue to get lateral transfers.
3795904	3799829	I'm sorry, lateral applications from other agencies, officers of experience.
3799849	3802713	So we're hoping to hit that 150 goal by the end of year.
3802733	3803234	All right.
3803254	3803955	Thank you very much.
3803975	3806458	I did have the right memory up here.
3806538	3807439	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
3807487	3809028	Absolutely.
3809128	3812351	Any further, well, any further questions or discussions on this?
3813292	3813853	Yeah, Director Riesha.
3815694	3816035	Thank you, sir.
3816115	3837274	So I just wanted to note in the in the past upon request, the agency has provided a breakdown of how many just like our security personnel from, you know, our city to contracted and even break down in terms of with our contracted Allied Force like
3838402	3843989	the ones that are authorized to have firearms versus not, and our mental health staff and stuff.
3844009	3850296	So that's something that I think the agency, I'm sure the agency would be happy to provide like that breakdown chart.
3850376	3852239	I think it's been a little over a year since we've had one.
3852719	3861249	So I just wanted to offer that to those who are interested and just to piggyback on Secretary Nicholson's comments.
3862431	3862711	Thank you.
3863372	3864013	Thank you, Director.
3866335	3866435	Okay.
3866456	3867717	Any further comments or questions?
3869317	3870118	Okay, seeing none.
3870238	3872161	So I did have, thank you, Chief.
3872962	3876066	I did have Nicholson as the mover and Roush as the second.
3876566	3878569	Are there any no votes on this item?
3882814	3886739	Okay, seeing none, the item will pass 14-0-1 absent.
3887580	3891866	We are hitting our two hour mark, so we are gonna take a break for our cart employee.
3892947	3896151	Let's shoot to be back here at nine o'clock.
3896291	3897012	Would that be enough time?
3898409	3898749	Nope.
3898770	3899350	Okay.
3899370	3899571	Okay.
3899591	3900592	Let's do 905 then.
3901153	3901714	Thank you.
3901734	3902675	Thank you.
3902695	3927690	We'll back at 905.
3927940	3954935	We've got it.
3954955	3955215	We've got it.
3955235	3955435	All right.
3955455	3955736	There are two.
3955756	3955956	All right.
3957809	3968376	not.
3988994	3990536	Yeah.
3990836	3991277	Yeah.
3991377	4011103	Yeah.
4023976	4025038	Yeah.
4025058	4027322	Yeah.
4027943	4047317	Yeah.
4065252	4070622	You know what it is.
4111996	4113899	Okay.
4114380	4115702	But yeah.
4117064	4119828	Yeah.
4120449	4139860	I hear.
4144700	4172057	We had a tower backed up on Friday night.
4172408	4178217	And, uh, Senator, if you're in the hot quarter, so you know, it's not a big deal.
4178278	4183626	So, but if my daughter's school, no, they're out there, like an ankle thing.
4183767	4185169	I don't know.
4186591	4187272	I don't know.
4187412	4188294	I don't know.
4188314	4189776	I don't know.
4189796	4191940	I don't know.
4192180	4193783	I don't know.
4193963	4195065	I don't know.
4195125	4196187	I don't know.
4196367	4197589	I don't know.
4212250	4217678	Thank you.
4219941	4240452	Thank you.
4240870	4258963	You do it.
4317247	4326719	We're out of time.
4327079	4334428	We're out of time.
4334548	4345802	We're out of time
4356532	4357970	I'm sorry.
4391024	4418905	Okay.
4432013	4452233	Thank you very much.
4506635	4507924	Yeah, we're gonna get started.
4508186	4511430	Have you seen Jack?
4546814	4572809	All right, folks, we're at 906.
4573931	4575032	We're going to get started.
4579433	4580655	Director Bouquet, how do you vote?
4581015	4581536	I mean, yes.
4585262	4591852	We have a quorum of me and Director Packillary and Director Nicholson and Director Harwick.
4607075	4607415	All right.
4607581	4609083	Thank you everyone for your patience.
4609483	4612807	We are now moving on to our next recommended action for tonight.
4614069	4626664	And that is going to be the recommended action of the 2025-2028 Title VI program update to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
4627165	4628687	Do we have a motion?
4629768	4630289	So moved.
4630849	4631911	I have Catlin as the mover.
4632932	4633633	Second, Guzman.
4633933	4635495	Guzman is the second.
4636960	4641367	I do understand that Director Banker has two amendments she would like to offer on this item.
4641747	4644271	Director Banker will take your amendments one at a time.
4645814	4647777	What is your first amendment, Director Banker?
4648338	4649159	Thank you very much.
4649860	4656370	And I'm glad everybody is now, you know, second wind and we're ready to go on to our
4657244	4659409	I don't know, six or seventh hour of meeting.
4660371	4663760	Actually, I will tell you I have three.
4663800	4665043	We'll see how things go.
4665083	4666165	They're short.
4667168	4669674	The first one, well, let me give you a little bit of background.
4669774	4670636	Okay.
4670656	4675708	So the background is I met with my four cities back in February and March.
4675688	4680192	And of course, you meet with them and you say hi and you say, okay, what are your needs?
4680272	4681093	What are your wants?
4682154	4691943	I met with all of them and they all gave me a list of basically trying to restore service that was removed during the pandemic.
4691963	4702533	And so, of course, as my job as director, I'm trying to work with our staff to try to get that service restored.
4703373	4703974	And so,
4705726	4729371	One of my questions or issues is I am guessing that when the RTD Board had to make the hard decisions of how to cut service almost in half because of this highly unusual pandemic, perhaps some of these cuts were not done equally across all 15 districts.
4729587	4734775	Director Banker, I'm sorry to interrupt, just so that we keep in order, could we get a second on?
4735155	4736838	Could you read the motion and then we get a second?
4736858	4750378	Yes, the motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact from 10% to 20% as it relates to major service changes and consistent with the FTA circular 4702.1B.
4752020	4758430	And I believe the version that will be voted on is actually the version that
4759000	4760842	Mr. Kroll put up for us.
4761924	4764147	So that's, that's the language right there.
4764187	4771517	The first motion is to move the move to amend the 2025, 2028 title six program update, such that the threshold for triggering either.
4771977	4780088	Disappointed Burton or disparate in that fine late night, finding a rising from a major service change from 10% to 20%.
4781770	4782591	Do I have a second?
4783072	4783433	Second.
4783453	4785575	Pagliari is the second.
4786457	4786797	Thank you.
4787637	4794125	So just to continue a little bit more background and then we can start, I guess, the debate here.
4795066	4802115	I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during the pandemic.
4802936	4817475	And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations come out.
4817455	4832292	I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic and perhaps do it a little bit quicker and
4833605	4837794	and also try to make it not quite so difficult.
4838215	4849538	So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the city and county of Broomfield, and their transportation staff went through
4849518	4857468	our items quite closely and they sent us all a letter with recommended changes.
4858209	4868021	So I've gone through with their changes and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the board, see what your thoughts are.
4868642	4871225	You know, hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see what happens.
4871666	4877533	But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that
4877513	4886844	the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large transit agencies.
4887525	4892992	And so I did send you also a copy of the city and county of Broomfields letter just to refresh your memory.
4893993	4901162	And so I would like to put forth that the first amendment would be changing the threshold from 10% to 20%.
4901182	4902663	Thank you, Treasurer Baker.
4902804	4905647	So again, the discussion right now is on the motion
4906319	4908643	This first motion, the first amendment.
4908984	4909805	Director Catlin.
4913411	4914313	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
4914934	4917759	I'd like to ask GM CEO Johnson.
4918540	4931422	I heard from someone I don't remember now because it's getting late, but someone said that some of those assumptions made by City and County Broomfield were incorrect.
4931482	4931622	Ms.
4931662	4932023	Johnson.
4932307	4933428	Yes, thank you very much.
4934129	4952606	Relative to the comments that were made, and thank you very much, Director Catlin, as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned being part of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in Greater Seattle and then Chicago Transit Authority.
4954388	4959192	That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there,
4959661	4963024	This is not correct relative to where we sit.
4963485	4970932	And more specifically, I do know our director of civil rights when we were going through this quite naturally in the role that he is in.
4970993	4976018	He and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies.
4976038	4981363	So that's the communique that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving this information.
4981603	4986208	So Mr. Green, if you want to just expound succinctly and briefly.
4986661	4992248	Yes, thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson, to expand upon the response.
4992288	5001740	I just also want to ground us in first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes.
5002381	5009530	And in doing that audit, we looked at 22, rather 23 different organizations, which includes the four.
5009510	5013695	Marta, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority.
5014235	5025428	And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right?
5025629	5027571	And ours is stacked in the middle.
5027611	5029533	So I want to give you some numbers here.
5030294	5032817	So for the four that I just mentioned,
5033911	5042602	Marta has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%.
5043623	5054637	And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, six out of that 23 have 5% or less, two have 8%,
5054971	5063929	six, which includes us, or seven, including us, is at 10%, three at 15%, and then three at 20%.
5064150	5070803	And in my over eight years of doing this work, and I'll just say that
5070783	5082882	When you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve, specifically with Title VI.
5083463	5089112	Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service.
5089818	5097146	There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth.
5097666	5109138	This is just a mechanism for the agency, such as RTD and the board of directors, so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant.
5109158	5117327	So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.
5119349	5121713	I've director Ruchin next.
5126580	5131227	Um, I did have a question, but I also, um, treasure banker had her hand up and it was her motion.
5131327	5133611	So I'm happy to, to wait if that was in response.
5134392	5134973	Treasure banker.
5136335	5142264	Um, I, I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic.
5143225	5146470	So how can we restore
5147750	5152399	let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several years ago.
5152840	5160654	How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had that service?
5161536	5164662	And so now we're being told
5164642	5173772	that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to have it.
5174934	5182062	And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to pre-pandemic levels?
5183403	5183564	Ms.
5183584	5183964	Johnson.
5184264	5185886	Yes, thank you very much, Director Banker.
5185926	5187508	That question is better suited for me.
5187548	5191813	Relative to the service delivery framework that we have,
5192097	5210798	While Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy service is based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours, but more specifically at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP.
5211439	5217666	When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were.
5218321	5220785	85% of what service levels were in 2019.
5221546	5230721	We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward.
5231783	5236971	What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious
5237390	5241798	and how we're applying service because we do want to ensure there's equity.
5241838	5248370	I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well.
5248811	5259330	As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change.
5259665	5282415	That is up to the board quite naturally, but I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service keeping in mind that all transit agencies across, you know, the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power.
5283138	5288485	Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio.
5288585	5298579	What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio.
5298920	5306250	We've deviated from that and have a waiver and we're right sizing the fleet as we move forward.
5306290	5312318	So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory or were.
5312500	5313942	And we're coming back from that.
5314924	5327185	We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area from an origin and destination vantage point just by virtue of how our service area is going forward.
5327686	5331032	So I'm not providing this to say I don't.
5331012	5333254	understand what you're trying to do.
5333275	5338961	And as I share it with you, I do clearly and we want to work within the frameworks that we have.
5339602	5345428	But a whole cell of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible.
5345508	5353577	And I say it from the vantage point of, we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour.
5354030	5355552	but that was out on the street.
5355852	5359316	Does that really yield the return on investment going forward?
5359416	5366965	Hence, that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services going forward.
5367386	5368847	Okay, but if I can.
5368988	5370930	Treasure, yeah.
5371010	5375015	Some of the issues that you just raised are important.
5375195	5375816	There's no doubt.
5376156	5380421	However, I don't believe it goes to the equity calculation.
5382884	5383024	I
5385080	5400760	What I think is important to to hear from staff and I know we're going to be talking about this in our retreat, which is I'm looking forward to that is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in three years.
5401432	5420994	what barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110, and start quickly, or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher service levels.
5422957	5423117	Ms.
5423157	5423497	Johnson.
5423778	5424178	Thank you.
5424198	5427642	There's a couple of external factors that play into that.
5427993	5434926	quite naturally when we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate and the lack of people commuting in.
5435427	5447309	It's important to keep in mind that there was, I'm forgetting the name, but the city and county of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the occupancy levels.
5447570	5451537	But more specifically, what's important to note is that
5451517	5456726	there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to this central business district.
5457949	5468388	I believe the last time I looked at stats, city and county at Denver was in the bottom three out of out of 50 major cities.
5468828	5472495	And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number
5474078	5478923	is the third state relative to remote work and then City of Boulder is number one.
5479344	5487092	While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic.
5487452	5496882	How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before?
5497563	5501487	I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward
5501838	5525374	relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery.
5525894	5528959	And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power,
5529260	5553588	we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available where people whereby were working extra shifts and then we didn't have enough people for daily pullout on those other routes.
5554009	5557613	And so I'm providing that context to say
5557930	5577930	to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do, but to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of this agency's.
5580020	5580440	Thanks, sir.
5580480	5583864	So I have a question for legal.
5585285	5595475	So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I want to be careful of my words.
5597297	5608187	Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public comment process or
5608741	5613908	Is that something that we, I guess, I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area.
5613988	5616131	And I wanted to get a bit of feedback on that.
5616591	5621217	Now, to disparage the motion, I just also want to understand the potential legal implications.
5626324	5628687	I will address that question.
5629228	5631891	And then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound.
5631991	5635035	I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement,
5635606	5659386	and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference of public perception.
5659855	5665784	There is leeway relative to the circular in light of what can be done.
5665864	5678945	We are sitting here on May 28th, recognizing that we have a new administration and that we do need to have a Title VI program that's submitted and we have been engaged on this topic since January.
5679406	5682030	That's not to negate any amendments or anything like that.
5682110	5684614	I am just trying to answer the question.
5684797	5691965	But more specifically, Mr. Green, since you are very well-versed in 4702.1B, I would yield the floor to you.
5692025	5696069	And that's the citation for the FTA circular that we're talking about.
5696509	5696690	Yes.
5696750	5698872	Thank you so much, GM CEO Johnson.
5698932	5700133	You.
5704538	5706940	Apology, the positive microphone.
5707221	5707521	Yes.
5707881	5708322	Apologies.
5708382	5712306	But to piggyback off what GM CEO Johnson has noted,
5713332	5720373	That is, I would couch that as the bigger risk is when we think about establishing policy, right?
5720433	5725047	As it relates to 4702.1B, the FTA Title VI circular.
5725432	5734847	it does call upon the agency to do a lot of outreach and public involvement to ensure that we are collecting that feedback to inform decisions.
5735408	5748790	So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as the policy.
5749495	5753620	So, but with respect to the circular, we can, i.e.
5753940	5757885	the board of directors could adopt a different threshold.
5757905	5771001	So for example, the one that director banker has put forth, although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update.
5771761	5779030	There is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the board is ultimately approving the policy.
5780917	5781318	Thank you.
5782179	5786085	Director Gysinger and then Director Larson.
5789690	5791212	Director Larson and then Harwick.
5793395	5793816	Thank you.
5795378	5810400	I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were for service changes, this Title VI analysis that were in the
5810583	5833095	the board packet, and it seemed like most of the time we, you know, sometimes there was a little bit of disparate impact on one route or the other, but mostly it sort of ended up that in the aggregate there wasn't really much, and there were legitimate justifications for what there was on an individual basis.
5833896	5838042	I guess my, you know, my basic question is with
5838393	5846480	with regard to this update and the changes that we're proposing, are we just, I mean, is there really a problem here?
5846500	5848682	Are we just making this harder for ourselves?
5848742	5859872	Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact one place or the other.
5859933	5863716	We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons.
5864677	5868180	And on balance, they don't really seem to
5868785	5881669	under our current setup, you know, ever, ever sort of look like they were, you know, there were somehow some, you know, bad intent or just inattention to who we're serving.
5881729	5887840	It seems like we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have done anyways.
5888208	5908974	Why put sort of a greater burden, sort of regulate ourselves more than we have to, and why not just give us the freedom to operate as we would as much as we can, given that we don't, you know, it doesn't necessarily seem like it's been a problem for a long time, at least from what I could see.
5909014	5917405	I mean, there weren't that many Title VI complaints that I could, that I, in the information that was provided.
5917874	5918256	I don't know.
5919442	5922537	My basic question is why would we make things harder for ourselves?
5922898	5923140	Thanks.
5924908	5925793	Thank you, Ms.
5925833	5926315	Johnson.
5927780	5928401	Thank you very much.
5928461	5945298	The one thing I would share Director Larson, as we look at the modification that's been put forward for your consideration, like a 36 month period, as we're adding back service, there could be unforeseen consequences as we do them in a segmented fashion.
5945618	5955188	And so that's one element as a whole, because if we're making modifications going forward, there could be an adverse impact.
5955488	5957911	And so that's what I would showcase there.
5958692	5970728	Keeping in mind to the point that you raised, when we talk about the aspect of DIDB, it's what can we do as an agency to help mitigate that to your point going forward.
5970949	5980301	But it's just to ensure that we have a program whereby we are not causing undue harm to certain population segments.
5982764	5983285	Director Larson.
5985307	5993215	But it just seems like when I was reading the documents that there, we, there's always a legitimate to justification for, for everything we want to do.
5993235	6001124	Or we, you know, it's always, there's always this, we'll have a disparate impact, but we have a legitimate justification for, for doing this.
6001204	6002425	So we're, we're just going to do it.
6002966	6011955	I mean, how many times, how many times in the last however many years has it been that we did this analysis, we looked at all the service changes we wanted to do.
6012323	6016770	And we were like, okay, no, we're not going to do this list of service changes.
6016810	6023039	We're going to, you know, cross out these ones because the aggregate impact is too much.
6023640	6025843	I mean, is it, is it, is that happened?
6026043	6032733	I just didn't, from what I read in the packet, I didn't, I don't know if I caught everything, but it didn't seem like there were a lot of those.
6032994	6041807	Or is this happening kind of at an earlier stage where when Bob in service says, let's just send a bunch of buses to Cherry Hills Village, somebody says, no, no.
6042040	6046365	That's not going to work out before it even gets to this point.
6047566	6047847	You know?
6050269	6050750	I'm sorry.
6051491	6052492	Thank you for the question.
6052532	6053613	It's for me.
6053753	6059179	I've only been here for five years and I came in the height of the pandemic and we've been adding back service and not.
6059560	6069651	So that's difficult for me to answer just because we have not been in a situation whereby
6070357	6071459	It's been the opposite.
6072120	6074403	Carl, do you have anything to add?
6075004	6075405	Yeah.
6075425	6076927	I would just highlight chair bouquet.
6076947	6094153	If I may, since January 2023, there was about 270 service change recommendations that have been implemented and roughly 26, 24, 26 of those 276 were considered major service changes.
6094657	6101608	And out of that 26 to director Larson's point, there has been 13 potential disparate impacts.
6102449	6106555	And to your point, there was a substantial legitimate justification.
6106575	6116631	And going it's, I wouldn't necessarily couch it as an exercise, but I would say we were the transit equity office within within the civil rights division.
6116881	6121415	works hand in glove with Jesse Carter and his team service development.
6122177	6129861	And as we are having those conversations after the service change recommendation are put forth and we analyze it if there is a potential disparate impact.
6130212	6135922	More often than not, to your point, and to my earlier, earlier point, that Title VI is not a stopping mechanism.
6136443	6147202	And I wouldn't necessarily state that it's burdensome because it's one of our responsibilities to make sure that we are equitably distributing services across our service area.
6147863	6155376	But more often not, there is a legitimate justification to put forth the service recommendation as it is presented to the board.
6158073	6158474	Thank you.
6159576	6159837	Director.
6162021	6162121	Okay.
6162142	6168515	Uh, I had director Harwick and just as a reminder, we're currently in discussion regarding this first motion.
6168595	6173044	Just want to make sure that, um, first amendment, excuse me, first amendment.
6173064	6176572	So make sure, uh, comments are around that.
6177033	6177634	Director Harwick.
6179369	6190030	Mine will be comments about this, but also moving forward as well, because I am in support of this, this title six, not, not the amendment, just as just a straight title six.
6190050	6195741	Um, you know, I, I don't think moving, uh, from, from 10 or from.
6195721	6201028	from 10% to 20% is going to increase ridership.
6201248	6211441	I think that right now it allows our staff the ability to really center equity and effectively protect our communities.
6211521	6218269	And while I get that Broomfield feels like they want more service, I don't think this is going to get it there.
6218907	6223928	I think this is the 11th hour and I think that it's really imperative that our staff has worked extremely hard on this.
6223948	6229390	They've had to jump through a whole variety of hoops.
6230095	6255293	bunch of different board members and I think that we're here, they've done an incredible job and I think that this is, they are the subject matter experts and it's our opportunity here to put our trust in them, our belief in them and I think that we owe them that and we have been talking about this since January so we're well into four months and I think that it is key that we support this
6255273	6264211	Title six as is and we allow them to move forward and we allow them to start you know handing us off to the feds and we can move forward and That's where I'm at.
6264331	6264612	Thank you.
6264972	6274952	Thank you director any further conversation on this amendment Secretary Nicholson So this is for our deputy general counsel
6275388	6287544	If we were to pass this tonight, what's the legal risk to the agency when it comes to our federal Title VI approval as a result of this change?
6287704	6300101	Like, is this gonna have any, would this have any legal repercussions or could we just, do we feel pretty comfortable that we could do this and not have the federal government take issue with it?
6301482	6303385	In regards to the amendment secretary?
6303405	6303505	Yeah.
6306910	6307491	deputy counsel.
6311415	6311755	There we go.
6311775	6312255	Excuse me.
6312816	6314177	Uh, thank you, director Nicholson.
6314738	6316019	Um, I, I don't have concerns.
6318922	6319323	Secretary.
6321165	6321725	That is all.
6322806	6323907	Uh, yeah, treasure banker.
6325389	6333357	Um, here is where I do not understand in 2019.
6335716	6337201	We had the service.
6338506	6342902	My area, my district as many others have grown.
6342962	6346013	There's no
6347208	6355277	For example, the town of Erie, just a few years ago was 20,000, now it's 40,000, like two, three years later.
6355297	6363345	And when I met with Erie, they said, hey, we're planning going to 80,000 in just the next couple of years.
6364086	6374717	I also read in the Denver Post that the town of Erie is the 15th fastest city in the country in terms of population growth.
6375727	6391322	So my question is, is if we had the service prior to the pandemic and it was serving all of these communities, why is it so difficult to get that restored?
6395466	6396086	Just Johnson.
6399770	6402392	So thank you, Director Banker.
6404667	6424808	This, what I'm going to say goes back to the previous comments that I had before, recognizing that RTD is a regional service and the way the service was outlined for all intents and purposes was bringing individuals into the central business district.
6427270	6432936	That level of ridership isn't there and that's not to negate that there
6433844	6439258	is some elements centered on a need to move people to and fro.
6439318	6443047	Hence, that's why there was the advent of the partnership program.
6443388	6450486	And one of the reasons why Erie basically wanted to join the district because they were looking to put forward an application
6450837	6476018	for the partnership program, and I know you're just using that as an example, but just wanted to further iterate that because for all intents and purposes, as we're looking to provide mobility options, the intent behind the partnership program was more or less like a pilot in the sense that let's see how many people are utilizing this means of connection
6476656	6488651	prior to putting out a 40 foot or a 60 foot Arctic that costs more money per revenue hour and doesn't yield the same return on investment relative to the cost per boarding.
6490253	6493037	Does that help or did I complicated more?
6493077	6496661	Okay.
6496682	6497082	Thank you.
6497222	6499105	Director Guzman and then Director Geisinger.
6499846	6503791	So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight.
6504191	6506494	I'm getting back to the motion before us.
6506997	6519312	I would like to ask one question, which is the 10 to 20% is still not going to prevent us from adding services.
6520293	6535232	It is simply a filter through which to look, if I understand this correctly, that we are not unintentionally harming community with protected status under the Title VI legislation,
6535634	6542843	or those that might be disproportionately burdened or impacted by their financial and economic status within the region.
6543964	6556219	The only purpose we need to pass this is because it is due, because it is the law, and it is how we ensure that we are able to receive our federal funding, which is approximately 25% of our total budget.
6557400	6560764	So I just want to make sure I understand.
6560980	6565827	what has been presented here does not tell the board no, we cannot provide transit service.
6566608	6586195	It is simply a way to look at it and say we may have an issue if it reaches a certain threshold that we need to be aware of in order to be able to approve changes in service, fair changes or other changes that would create a potential burden on specific
6587137	6590501	communities as defined within the Title VI language.
6590701	6595027	Is that correct or am I completely lost in this conversation?
6596849	6597590	Chair, are we okay for me?
6597970	6599031	Absolutely, Mr. Green.
6599051	6603136	If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear.
6603196	6605880	And if you have any double back, then I'll respond to it.
6606500	6612047	So the current 10%, so if we think about different thresholds for DIDB,
6612770	6641983	And we are in, based off the desk audit, we're in the middle tier of having a threshold that allows us as an agency, which ultimately each service equity analysis is approved by the board of directors, where it allows us, again, to your point, when we're thinking about BIPOC or Black Indigenous people of color, for disparate impact or loan communities, for disproportionate burden, it allows us to make a well-informed, eyes-wide open decision
6642402	6646948	of better understanding of who's more likely to receive more of the impact.
6647469	6656020	And when we're thinking about service increases, we're thinking about the fair share of benefits, where if there is a service reduction, we're looking at who's more likely to receive more of the burden.
6656540	6666173	So to your point, Director Guzman, it allows us to just get a better understanding of the level of impact that we can have on a particular community.
6666594	6669237	It does not prevent us from moving forward.
6671191	6671612	Thank you.
6671632	6678953	I would just urge a no vote and let's move on to the policy.
6679856	6680317	All right.
6681139	6685993	Dr. Geisinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this specific amendment.
6686227	6687389	I'll be super quick.
6687409	6693637	At that last explanation that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of just giving us a better holistic view.
6693657	6701487	But I shared Director Larson's sort of view of are we just making this harder for ourselves, creating more work?
6703230	6704051	Is that not right?
6705593	6706534	Mr. Green?
6706554	6708276	Yeah, that's a great follow up question.
6708296	6709618	I would say it
6710847	6738711	I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when we think about what we're ultimately trying to achieve and a percentage that's mathematically consistent relative to the populations that we serve, so in doing this work, given my background, right, in doing an assessment of whether if we, and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is
6738978	6750132	with doing this work, or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyses, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything.
6751393	6762066	And that's a disservice when we think about our populations within our service area, specifically as we look at our census data where 38.1% is BIPOC, 13.1%.
6762653	6765596	or 14.1 rather for low income, right?
6765716	6769960	And then if we look at the onboard survey, 56% are considered BIPOC.
6770981	6791800	And so I say all that to say, just to wrap it up, is that 10% threshold for DINDB allows us to make an informed decision that is backed by not only our desk audit, but the years of experience and knowing, having a better understanding of ultimately what we're trying to achieve.
6794345	6794765	Thank you.
6795086	6795406	Thank you.
6795927	6797628	All right, let's do a roll call vote.
6797648	6807759	As a reminder, it is the First Amendment being introduced, as you all can see on that screen, with Director Banker as the mover and Director Pagulieri as the second.
6807859	6810541	Again, we're voting on this First Amendment.
6811342	6811923	Treasure Banker.
6812784	6813004	Yes.
6813825	6814926	Director Buzik is gone.
6814966	6816387	Director Katlin.
6818009	6819030	No.
6819050	6820271	Director Geisinger.
6822874	6822934	No.
6824348	6824729	Director.
6824849	6825169	No.
6825189	6825329	No.
6826051	6827092	No.
6827112	6827332	No.
6827413	6827753	No.
6828174	6828935	No.
6828955	6829135	No.
6829656	6829856	No.
6830637	6830838	No.
6831138	6831258	No.
6831999	6832220	No.
6833321	6833562	No.
6833622	6837628	No.
6841073	6842916	No.
6844458	6847302	No.
6848344	6850507	No.
6850708	6850848	No.
6851389	6851689	No.
6854048	6855471	I mean, yes, but the motion will fail.
6856953	6860099	And we have three to 10.
6861342	6862965	Okay.
6862985	6863466	Moving on.
6863726	6864307	Yes, Director.
6864347	6866491	I would like to withdraw the next two amendments.
6866912	6867614	Next two amendments.
6867754	6867954	Yes.
6868635	6869617	Okay.
6869637	6872142	The next two amendments have been withdrawn.
6873522	6875067	Okay, they were never introduced.
6875107	6881829	So they're not really with John, but now you would return back to the debate on the main motion, which is to approve the title six program update.
6882251	6882632	Excellent.
6883174	6884418	Back to the main motion at hand.
6885000	6885642	Director Keith.
6887174	6894424	So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on this action.
6894484	6897207	There's a few things going on.
6897247	6900412	First of all, it should never get to the last minute.
6900932	6906099	The board should never be asked to pass things because it's due in two days.
6906420	6912608	And I know there's a lot of things that go into the delay, but that's just not the right
6913077	6919510	That's not the right urgency to place on the board act.
6919810	6926884	Secondly, I don't know very much about this topic and I have sat in on two operations committee meetings.
6928327	6929550	I've talked to a bunch of people.
6929610	6932335	I've done my own research.
6932315	6937602	And I still am looking for a succinct description of the program.
6937642	6943230	I would note that there was a wonderful book written by Robert Carrow.
6943250	6944372	It's called The Power Broker.
6944612	6946855	I'm sure a lot of people in this room know it.
6947596	6954205	Talks a lot about bad policy decisions on disadvantaged communities.
6954185	6962324	and how those decisions were made and the harmful outcome of those decisions.
6963767	6968278	It is 15 pages shorter than our packet tonight.
6968731	6978289	He won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1200 page treatise on impact by public infrastructure.
6978309	6985423	I would request that when we're passing along documents as part of a packet,
6985403	6990088	it needs to have a point and it should be summarized from the committee for the rest of the board.
6990148	6995373	Simply passing things along for us does not help me understand this better.
6995393	7002580	I'm probably a yes vote tonight, but I was a no vote until about an hour and a half ago.
7002640	7012170	And so I just, when you are putting together packets on complex questions for the board,
7012150	7016376	Given us reams of paper does not help us get to a better decision.
7017097	7029856	So that's something request for the two three ish committee chairs As you're putting together topics like this and that would be very helpful for me to make better Decisions.
7030437	7030697	Thanks.
7031018	7031719	Thank you director.
7031839	7034703	Okay any further comments or questions on the main motion?
7035765	7040892	Dr. Guzman, I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously
7041496	7047163	submitted a proclamation for RTD on May 19th, 2025.
7047263	7048845	It is in the director's emails.
7049506	7066086	It was sent over by city council that they wholeheartedly support the 2025, 2028 title six program to include the proposed updates to major service change, disparate impact and fair equity policies, as well as updates to RTD's public participation plan and language access plan, which we are voting on now.
7066808	7071073	and that the clerk and recorder of the city and county of Denver did affix the seal making it official.
7072275	7074017	I believe that that is necessary.
7074037	7092681	There's a whole proclamation, you can read through it, but former board director Lewis, sorry, we had two Lewises and I wanted to make sure I said it right, did work with city council member Serena Gutierrez Gonzalez and
7093285	7097534	The unanimity of that vote is remarkable from our city council.
7097634	7101081	So they stand behind this as well with us to move this forward.
7101101	7102063	Thank you.
7102083	7102905	Thank you, director.
7103687	7104388	Director Larson.
7106312	7107374	I'm going to be a no vote.
7107815	7109218	I think.
7109738	7113864	I think it's kind of like I said, we're constraining our freedom to operate.
7113924	7116928	We're spending a lot of energy and effort to track this.
7117308	7131007	And I know the intentions behind that are good, but I think just as a matter of principle, we shouldn't be sort of trying to over, or regulating ourselves more.
7131428	7134632	We should be thinking is, we have not,
7134612	7147170	There's not really a lot of evidence that we have disparately ever had any recent plans to expand service or decrease service in a way that
7147623	7152349	that causes a disparate impact on these populations.
7152770	7171133	And I honestly believe that if we focused 100% just on increasing ridership, which is what I think we should be doing, and not trying to expand our sort of purview about when, you know, when maybe we shouldn't increase ridership, I don't know if we really, if it's legitimate, we'll do it anyways.
7171467	7186633	I really think if we were focusing strictly on increasing ridership, we would actually, it would all be disparately impacted in favor of all the communities we're worried about just based on the way population is distributed in the area.
7187114	7196530	And I would like for us to kind of move towards a paradigm of focusing much, much more on increasing ridership across the board.
7196965	7202020	and less on finding possible reasons to not increase ridership.
7203163	7204146	So I'll be in no vote.
7204166	7205089	Thanks.
7205109	7205951	Thank you, Director Larson.
7206032	7206874	Secretary Nicholson.
7208491	7217099	So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session and a town hall all on this topic.
7217479	7228369	And I should say, expertly facilitated by our co-chairs and by our chair of finance and our staff.
7228649	7234294	And I feel like I just starting to get a decent understanding of it.
7234494	7238498	Like I came into this knowing nothing about this.
7238478	7258461	I was an absolute no when we first started and my public remarks, you know, made that very clear but I want to commend staff and our board leadership who were willing to indulge because I came to understand it.
7258863	7270864	I came to understand what it was for, I came to understand how it works, and I don't necessarily agree with all of it, and I think we could use more data in addition to those data we have now to determine this, but...
7271992	7273995	If we don't pass this, we lose federal funding.
7274316	7276479	So there's a good reason to pass it even if you don't like it.
7278021	7282789	But on top of that, I just think our staff did their jobs.
7283290	7288298	They have demonstrated to me this is the right thing to do despite my skepticism.
7288518	7290341	And so I'm definitely voting for it tonight.
7290982	7291723	Thank you.
7291743	7293105	Any further comments on the main motion?
7294503	7295205	Okay, seeing none.
7295225	7298011	We had Catlin as the mover and Guzman as the second.
7298532	7300497	There is indication that there will be no votes.
7300557	7302722	So I will be doing a roll call vote on this.
7304085	7304846	Uh, treasurer banker.
7304866	7306149	Uh, no.
7308034	7308695	Director Catlin.
7309597	7309818	Yes.
7312243	7313085	Dr. Geisinger.
7313555	7313835	Yes.
7314937	7315718	Dr. Gutierrez.
7316119	7316439	Yes.
7316960	7317621	Dr. Guzman.
7317821	7318062	Yes.
7318362	7319003	Dr. Harwick.
7319424	7319844	Yes.
7321166	7321847	Dr. Larson.
7322428	7322649	No.
7323249	7324051	Secretary Nicholson.
7324712	7324992	I'm in.
7326294	7327155	First Vice Chair O'Keeffe.
7328017	7328257	Yes.
7328657	7329439	Dr. Pagulari.
7331041	7331321	Yes.
7331962	7332603	Dr. Ruscha.
7332924	7334666	Yep.
7334747	7335748	Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
7335982	7336282	Yes.
7337043	7337905	I'm also, yes.
7338345	7344453	So the motion, the main motion will pass 11, two and two absent.
7345895	7346095	Yes.
7346416	7348258	That math adds up.
7348278	7348559	Okay.
7349079	7359773	Moving on, we're going to be moving to our next recommended action, which is the budget transfer articulated buses supporting Colfax bus rapid transit or BRT service.
7359873	7360775	Do I have a mover?
7361736	7362136	So moved.
7362176	7362597	Guzman.
7362644	7363726	I have Guzman as the mover.
7363746	7364447	Do I have a second?
7364567	7364848	Second.
7366550	7366711	Sir.
7367071	7367792	Yeah.
7367812	7368073	Oh, wait.
7368473	7369114	Well, I could be wrong.
7369134	7369455	I'm sorry.
7370256	7371238	I forgot we started late.
7371498	7372560	I thought we had our four hour mark.
7373041	7373562	Please ignore me.
7376546	7377087	Oh, sorry.
7377107	7378870	Guzman is the mover.
7378930	7380132	Whitmore is the second.
7383858	7384900	Any discussion on it?
7385881	7386863	Yeah, director Pagular.
7387231	7391818	I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting for this.
7391858	7404438	I was not necessarily sure how this would further the clean energy and zero emission goals of the state of Colorado.
7404458	7409025	And therefore, we'll just be voting now.
7409085	7409425	Thank you.
7411949	7413431	Any further conversation?
7413472	7414453	Secretary Nicholson?
7415767	7419856	Yeah, so I understand where we're the importance of what we're doing here.
7421459	7430839	I think that these buses in particular, you know, in my religion, there's a thing why is this night different from all other nights why are these buses different from all other buses.
7432068	7436232	These are going to be the flagship of our flagship BRT line.
7437093	7443740	And if these suck, it will kill BRT.
7444280	7458555	And if they are not comfortable, if they are not just awesome in every way possible, you can make a lot of choices when you buy a bus about how nice it's going to be in the same way you can make a lot of choices about when you buy a car about how nice it's going to be.
7459215	7462058	And so I just want to lean in here
7462038	7484939	and I do have one question, to say that we need to pull the stops out, we need to make sure we're giving you enough money, GMCO Johnson, to make sure we're buying top of the line, to make sure that these are things that when they run through my district, people go, wow, I want to get on that, not, wow, that doesn't look very nice.
7485659	7492045	And so my question for you is, how do you know that the amount of money that we're authorizing today
7492025	7494128	is enough to get top of the line.
7494909	7505364	And how many bytes at the Apple are we going to get to make sure that you are buying the right buses for this incredibly important project?
7506565	7506746	Ms.
7506806	7509490	Johnson is 51 million enough to make them not suck.
7510671	7511232	Yeah.
7512308	7515090	So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
7515731	7517733	And thank you for the question.
7518433	7519594	My apologies.
7519634	7520355	That was a good question.
7520575	7521336	Keep it in mind.
7521356	7525660	This is a budget transfer and full transparency.
7526180	7530724	Director Nicholson emailed me about this because I think there was some confusion about where we are.
7531045	7532626	There is yet to be a solicitation.
7532666	7534488	There's yet to be specifications.
7534888	7541674	So these monies that are being transferred or needed
7542076	7544399	for all intents and purposes so we can start a procurement.
7546841	7549845	Now, keeping in mind, there's a couple of elements.
7550185	7558355	These buses have to be dedicated because this is designated as a bus rapid transit project as defined by the Federal Transit Administration.
7558815	7564402	There's certain criteria that we have to ensure that we adhere to.
7564462	7571610	This will be a dedicated fleet just by virtue of the configuration of BRT with it being a center running platform.
7572097	7583033	So when you talk about it being top of the line, that's yet to be seen in reference to what we have before us because there's only two original equipment manufacturers in the United States.
7583093	7584635	There's only so many suppliers.
7584996	7593548	There are certain seeds and there is a national task force in which I sit where we're talking about doing away with customization because that increases prices.
7593798	7597842	I bet you don't know how many shades of white there is with new flier industries.
7598142	7598323	24.
7598623	7599684	How many?
7599704	7600285	24.
7600305	7601186	23.
7601446	7602927	I think I told you that earlier.
7603008	7613118	So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this, right, we're going to do our due diligence and we're going to ensure it's a competitive solicitation.
7613158	7620526	And we do understand the aspects because that's what separates bus rapid transit from general thick route service.
7621427	7621847	Thank you.
7622485	7624928	Secretary, I really appreciate it.
7625008	7629695	And I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how the purchase is going.
7632098	7632599	Yes.
7632619	7643594	Uh, director Griswold, just really quickly, uh, with regards to this, moving this money from the unrestricted fund is simply to begin the procurement process.
7644115	7647900	And although it's not part of the 2025 budget, we do need to get started on it.
7648501	7649202	Um, however,
7649452	7656600	I would suggest that as we go forward, these buses are meant to be purchased in finality by 2027 to begin this service.
7657241	7668754	And that is work that we will do to fully do on finance and planning to ensure that it is included in all necessary documents that come before this board for approval.
7669234	7672458	And I am certain that our new CFO is up to the task on that.
7672578	7678885	So rest assured, directors, we're not wantonly spending money, but we do need to authorize
7679422	7701987	this for the procurement of the buses at this point thank you thank you director any further discussion on this item all right there is a note oh no sounds good all right i was it was indicated there will be a no vote so i'll do a roll call vote again this is the budget transfer articulate articulated buses supporting coal fax vrt service uh treasure banker
7702473	7703414	Yes.
7703435	7704116	Dr. Catlin.
7704396	7704616	Yes.
7705498	7706219	Dr. Geisinger.

7710546	7711167	Dr. Harwick.
7711227	7711527	Yep.
7711848	7712529	Dr. Larsen.
7712689	7712989	Yes.
7713110	7713851	Dr. Nicholson.
7714392	7715594	Nicholson Gauper.
7717356	7717577	What?
7718077	7718498	Sorry.
7718518	7719660	That was a bad internet wreck.
7719680	7719940	Yes.
7721142	7721963	Nicholson is a yes.
7722044	7722945	Director O'Keefe.
7725355	7726756	Director Roqueeth is a yes.
7727217	7728078	Director Pagulari.
7728238	7728478	No.
7728958	7730039	Director Pagulari is a no.
7730099	7730780	Director Arusha.
7731000	7731921	Yes.
7731941	7732582	Director Whitmore.
7733663	7733883	Yes.
7734524	7735745	OK.
7735765	7738768	So that passes 12, 1, and 2.
7739668	7739969	All right.
7740009	7740669	Thank you, folks.
7740709	7741750	So we have one.
7742171	7743472	Chair Buke, could you remind us?
7743772	7748577	Over here, we missed who the mover and the seconder were on that.
7748957	7749938	I had Guzman and Whitmore.
7750278	7750459	OK.
7750539	7750839	Thank you.
7751540	7751920	Thank you.
7752743	7753624	Um, okay.
7753644	7753985	Excellent.
7754265	7755787	Uh, thank you all again for your patience.
7755807	7761734	We do have one more item and that is the equitable transit oriented development policy amendment.
7763096	7778194	So for the board of directors to approve the amendment to resolution number two series of 2021, which created the equal transit oriented development policy that permits and encourages the development of affordable housing on RTD real property in order to include guidelines for disposing
7778461	7782527	of RTD real property, below fair market value or rent.
7782887	7783548	Do we have a motion?
7783749	7784490	So moved, Guzman.
7784690	7785471	Guzman's the mover.
7785491	7786092	Do we have a second?
7786613	7787755	I have Harwick as a second.
7789697	7794985	I do understand that on this item, we have some proposed amendments from Director Nicholson and Director Ruscha.
7795926	7799772	Since Director Nicholson's amendment was circulated to the board first, we will start there.
7800393	7803237	Director Nicholson, please now make your motion to amend.
7803824	7817993	Yes, I'd like to move to amend the etod policy and I'm hoping that GMC GMC that Mr. Crawl can put up those that language on the screen.
7818954	7819395	It's there.
7820037	7820217	Right.
7821920	7822221	May I.
7823618	7826363	Uh, would you like to read the motion and then we'll get a second.
7826524	7826884	Thank you.
7826924	7827445	Yeah.
7827466	7841593	So, uh, move to amend the policy, uh, such that section five of the equitable transit oriented development policy regarding negotiated land price be updated as follows to raise the maximum negotiated land price discount to 75% from 50%.
7841573	7859970	and add the following additional factors to favorably consider projects which include more accessible units than required by law, limit residential parking, are deeply affordable, emphasize priority groups as identified by the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority,
7860085	7870429	and incorporate smaller footprint retail, including below market rate units, below market rate retail, excuse me, that prioritizes local businesses and entrepreneurs.
7873236	7875461	Excellent.
7875481	7876403	And do we have a second on that?
7876985	7877606	Second.
7877626	7878448	Hardwick is the second.
7880521	7882165	Secretary, would you like to discuss further?
7882425	7882786	Thank you.
7882806	7883027	Yes.
7883367	7895695	Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll to briefly describe the five pieces of written public comment that we received on this recommended action from some of our local public officials.
7896232	7904392	Yes, so four of the written public common items were submitted by individuals specifically supportive of the change director Nicholson is offering.
7904412	7914055	And those four individuals were the mayor of Boulder, a city council member from Boulder, a city council member from Westminster and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.
7914035	7928098	And then the fifth letter was submitted by SWEAP in joint with Conservation Colorado and Denver Streets Partnership, which spoke more broadly to the overall changes being offered this evening.
7930943	7931564	Perfect, Secretary.
7932045	7933347	Thank you.
7933367	7935891	And thank you, Executive Manager Crawl.
7936630	7939394	So here at RTD, we make lives better through connections.
7939755	7943381	Tonight as a board, we have an opportunity to do that in a particularly powerful way.
7944242	7946125	Our rider surveys tell a clear story.
7946666	7953277	Over half our passengers live below 200% of the federal poverty level, and they are far less likely to own a car.
7954018	7960849	Our riders with disabilities use RTD at disproportionately high rates, as do other vulnerable populations in our community.
7960829	7967738	Yet only a fraction of affordable housing developed near our stations truly meets the needs of our most dedicated riders.
7968419	7972405	Communities in our state have struggled to create housing targeted at our ridership.
7972785	7979134	Inclusionary zoning has mostly led to housing at 60% AMI, about $51,000 a year in earnings.
7979694	7988406	This housing is necessary but priced well out of reach for someone making only $31,000, which is 200% of the federal poverty line.
7988386	7997766	This amendment empowers RTD to deepen our land discount offerings, up to 75%, to incentivize projects specifically tailored to the actual economic realities of our riders.
7998428	8000151	Here's how that can work in practice.
8000171	8007407	Just this month, Denver Health donated the land to create Tapestry, a deeply affordable, accessible, transit-oriented housing project.
8007775	8016789	It supports a range of affordability from 30% to 80%, as well as far more three-bedroom and even four-bedroom units than most affordable projects being built today.
8017590	8024842	It targets accessibility because distance to transit is a major barrier for people with disabilities to use transit.
8024862	8032213	This holds for all types of disabilities and unfortunately, painfully few Class A fully accessible units exist
8032193	8033715	in the RTD service area.
8034255	8038579	By creating greater incentives for developers, we can do a lot to play our part in fixing that.
8039340	8045767	It's late, so I won't go through the argument for reduced parking and the service of CHFA's priority populations.
8046047	8047649	You all have an email from me with that data.
8048169	8054616	But I do want Director Harwick to speak after me to address the language he added on smaller footprint and below market retail.
8055437	8061863	Community is about more than housing, and I enthusiastically added his language for the reasons he'll highlight.
8062113	8066820	This framework recognizes that we are not the housing policy experts.
8067341	8086290	It increases the scope of our tools and trusts our staff to use them effectively to bring us thoughtful projects, projects that align with our strategic priority of community value and enable us to grow ridership by putting the people who most need transit where they can best be served by it.
8086831	8088233	I ask your support for this amendment.
8088754	8088954	Thank you.
8089856	8090196	Dr. Harbert.
8091661	8108050	Yeah, so I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD that we're really thinking also about mixed use TOD and I'm wildly in favor of Anything that we can do to bring more housing let alone affordable housing to
8108030	8109191	to our park and rides.
8109211	8120846	I do think it's really key that we also think about what are the businesses that we are bringing in there and, you know, having spent a lot of time working at Starbucks and a good friend of mine works at Starbucks.
8120866	8129717	You know, I'm also really in favor of coffee shops like Prodigy and smaller shops, but also thinking about when I've traveled to other
8129697	8152144	Communities throughout the world there oftentimes are smaller retail shops that give Young entrepreneurs that opportunity to start a business and not be burdened by a larger footprint that Some of our larger restaurants or larger retail shops can they can cover those those costs so you know this this to me was a way to encourage local businesses to
8152124	8167852	start up or expand and, you know, give them the opportunity in a place that we all, you know, we all, when we go to a parking ride and there's not something there to grab that quick bite to eat, I want to give them that opportunity, everyone that opportunity, one to shop there and sell there.
8169415	8172260	Director Harwick, any further discussion on this amendment?
8173362	8173963	Director Usha.
8174230	8176513	Uh, Mr. Chair, maybe you can help me here.
8176613	8181940	So I had a comment slash, but I had a comment on the main motion, but we moved to amendments.
8182361	8188269	But like recognizing that Secretary Nicholson's language can't exist without the motion language of the way it's drafted.
8188489	8190432	May I just make a general comment?
8190452	8191373	Does that sort of make sense?
8191533	8196560	It would apply to both, but I don't know if I would be called out of order and I'm tired of what you say.
8196600	8197201	So you know what?
8197221	8197641	Why not?
8197721	8198783	Let's give it a try.
8198863	8199664	Thanks.
8199644	8200305	I'm doing my best.
8200826	8212644	Okay, so this morning we got an email from staff that addressed some outstanding questions that I still had, just so I knew what I was voting on.
8213205	8226225	And I have a heartburn over just the main motion because the way it's written, we as a board,
8226475	8240030	are not just expanding the bounds of what a policy is, we're also signing away like 30 plus years of precedent of having this guardrail that says, before you go dispense of real property, get our preliminary authorization.
8240651	8248600	So I guess like I've, so I am already a little bit uncomfortable.
8249000	8251723	And also the policy says that if
8252092	8258579	A developer, as it relates to housing, cannot meet our 50% standard.
8259039	8264105	They could still get a major discount, and it could be millions and millions of dollars.
8264645	8271312	And so those two combined, and just recognizing that these deals take a long, long time, they're not suburb projects.
8272794	8281643	In sum, it means that all of that is going to happen, and then it's going to come back to the board when all of those decisions have been made.
8281859	8301235	and that and so it's for that because I'm struggling with the original proposal but I can accept it for now is why I can't vote yes on Secretary Nicholson's amendment because it doesn't because we don't have guardrails that I would prefer so I
8301603	8305688	I hope that was not out of order and if it was, thanks for not calling me out of order.
8305708	8306069	Thank you.
8306409	8307130	Are you director chef?
8307471	8308032	Director Guzmore.
8308873	8315642	So, ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee and this is my concern.
8318446	8324033	Although I am with you in spirit, deeply affordable housing is really important.
8324519	8333892	I'm not sure that giving an additional 25% discount in our policy is wise for a number of reasons.
8334233	8338679	I do believe, however, and maybe Madam CEO or Ms.
8338719	8341403	Chessie Brady might be able to speak to this, I'm not sure.
8343206	8350476	What we were asked for in this policy was to give guidelines to begin negotiation that would eventually come back to this board.
8351688	8363853	Let's say a developer comes to us and just brings us an amazing proposal that includes everything that you could want in a development and more.
8363873	8369605	I don't see why they wouldn't necessarily come back to us and say, hey, they're willing to do all of these things.
8369985	8370827	They being staff.
8371145	8385639	and asking for an additional amount of up to whatever amount makes sense to give that discount from the board that we would consider properly and then be able to authorize in that moment.
8386379	8392866	But in order to begin the process, we were simply asked to give authorization for them to work within a parameter.
8392926	8399272	That way there was no confusion that they would be able to do a 30 to 50% discount as was written in the original policy.
8399772	8400713	Beyond that,
8401385	8408376	the board would still have authority, as I understand it, if we were asked to offer an additional discount for more.
8409037	8426785	I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of the agency.
8426945	8428928	And so I would like to ask that question
8429431	8442383	Is there anything that would prevent you from coming back to us if we were to receive such an excellent proposal that prevents you from saying, can we receive an additional discount to offer a developer board?
8443125	8445330	And would you approve this so we can make a project work?
8447116	8447296	Ms.
8447316	8449059	Brady, first off, thank you for your patience.
8449079	8451122	I greatly appreciate you sticking around tonight.
8451162	8451602	Of course.
8451923	8453204	You're recognized.
8453525	8453865	Thank you.
8454526	8457450	No, there is nothing that would stop us from doing that.
8457931	8463639	As you say, the point of the policy is to create guardrails and certainty within those guardrails.
8464380	8473652	We would use the opinions of the board to guide developers towards what we think the board would be interested in as we're negotiating with them.
8473753	8474794	And we would come back to the board
8475112	8477235	for approval of any given project.
8478056	8478417	Thank you.
8479218	8491356	One more quick thing and Director Banker, Treasurer Banker, the sales and the lease income from our real estate properties are put into a specific account.
8491456	8492398	Can you guess which one?
8493139	8504916	Because when we deeply discount things beyond where we should, we are saying no to the potential income that we could use for operations and maintenance and service provision
8505554	8506636	elsewhere in the agency.
8507296	8514907	So on balance, real estate and real property are a finite resource, and dollars can be stretched thin.
8515668	8526324	But how we use the opportunity to either receive money to prolong and serve the public further is a huge consideration in this.
8526564	8531191	So although I am with you in spirit, I would be voting no on the amendment as it is right now.
8531872	8532492	Thank you, Director.
8533434	8534295	Director Pagulieri.
8534630	8536292	Thank you, I'll be brief.
8536712	8541438	I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply agree with.
8542219	8543801	I am a little bit concerned about two things.
8543841	8546544	The first is the language deeply affordable.
8546564	8551309	It's a little bit ambiguous, if I'm saying that right.
8552291	8562983	And I think using language like that can, like, what's to say, they discounted $100 to some, that's a deep discount to others, that's nothing.
8562963	8570914	So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can divine it elsewhere.
8571435	8573638	But I do want to leave this language.
8573658	8581950	And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that I want.
8581930	8598726	And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75%, but this is our property and I really would like to see it sold for the highest value to benefit all.
8598947	8599287	Thank you.
8599788	8601913	Thank you, Director.
8602889	8605332	Just a quick question.
8605892	8613261	Some of these surplus properties that we're talking about, we are not including our current park and rides, correct?
8614282	8620489	Would be excess land, perhaps around a park and ride, but not one of our park and rides.
8622011	8622992	Just clarification.
8623733	8624214	Thank you.
8624234	8628158	So this policy is aimed at transoriented development.
8628619	8630601	So property that RTD owns
8630800	8633784	at transit stations or near high frequency transit.
8634404	8647240	Access property and surplus property are definable terms that perhaps Michelle could help us with, but those are distinctive properties that the board has named to be excess and surplus.
8647661	8650384	And so I just want to separate that from a park and ride.
8650424	8652407	A park and ride is certainly not excess or surplus.
8653268	8655531	It may have underutilized land.
8655691	8659896	It may have a large drainage area that is part of the park and ride.
8660551	8669414	But not every development that we would consider on a park and ride would remove parking if that's getting more to your question.
8670216	8670938	Okay, yes.
8673425	8674307	Secretary Nicholson.
8675435	8678138	I actually have some questions for Ms.
8678659	8678979	Brady.
8679620	8684386	So first off, Director Pagliari raised the concern about the term deep affordability.
8685006	8689612	I think you and I know what that means, but maybe the rest of the board doesn't, given it's a term of art.
8689672	8693356	Can you elaborate on what that's referring to?
8694097	8694258	Ms.
8694298	8694538	Brady.
8694978	8695279	Sure.
8695339	8695519	Yes.
8695819	8703889	Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means generally 30 to 40% of AMI.
8704308	8709427	It is squishy, I think still, but generally it's understood to mean 30 to 40%.
8709487	8711635	Secretary.
8712070	8719360	So second question, I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as a discount.
8721042	8734541	I was hoping maybe you could speak to like, because I mentioned it a little bit, but as someone who's an expert in the space, and I will say you and I worked pretty closely together on this language and went back and forth, you did a meeting with me.
8734621	8737024	So this isn't just something that I wrote myself.
8737104	8741470	This is something that got vetted pretty heavily by staff.
8742395	8758017	What impact does a greater discount have on the types of projects that in the affordable housing space you tend to see people able to build?
8758077	8762243	At least from where I sit, the reason for doing this is that
8762223	8771859	When it comes to those deeply affordable, which are deeply subsidized units, when it comes to things like units that are fully accessible, those are expensive.
8772120	8778551	They cost developers money, which is why when you don't have those subsidies, those units don't get built.
8778611	8782257	I think it's about half the projects that are in the CHFA database.
8782237	8790490	have zero units at 30% AMI and very few of them have anything with regard to accessibility.
8790510	8796559	So I'm hoping you can maybe elaborate on, you know, you're the one who would be using this tool at the end of the day.
8796599	8801246	How do you see it coming in handy with regard to what you're able to do?
8801867	8803330	And then I've won the last follow up.
8805152	8805493	It's pretty.
8809159	8809459	You're not.
8813185	8820073	Thank you.
8820793	8824778	So affordable housing projects aren't notoriously difficult to finance.
8825479	8836130	And I mean, I think if you use the example earlier of tapestry and Denver health, Denver health, as you stated is correct donated the land for tapestry.
8836170	8840235	I can assure you that that development was still very difficult to finance.
8841076	8841336	So
8841569	8851042	even if the land we were giving the land at 100% discount, the projects would still not pencil in many cases.
8851563	8869888	And so our ability to discount the land to 75% as the board prefers just in many cases could get us over the hump from a project not being built to a project being built and to that project having more affordable units as opposed to
8870105	8873649	a higher, more of a middle income range.
8874309	8876752	And that's the difference that the land discount makes.
8877112	8887704	And that's the certainty that this policy helps me bring to conversations with developers is, gets them in the mindset of we're going to get some help here from RTD.
8888484	8891107	We can focus on deeper affordability units.
8891127	8898475	We can make bigger promises to Chaffa or other financing entities to host in Denver.
8898877	8900839	It helps us keep the projects moving.
8901420	8909047	Um, but, and I'd be frank with you, this is, as I said, tapestry, even with a hundred percent discount, it's still hard to do.
8909227	8910569	This is not a silver bullet.
8911169	8917135	Um, but it, it moves the needle and it helps us actually, you know, keep projects afloat and get to the finish line.
8917555	8917996	Thank you, Ms.
8918016	8918356	Brady.
8918597	8921960	We're going to wrap up with director O'Keith and then director Larson.
8922460	8924142	Oh, I thought I got last word.
8924847	8927854	So, I support this amendment.
8927994	8939161	I think it is a reasonable step toward developing communities that are very likely to use our services.
8939301	8943531	And I think increasing ridership is something
8943511	8944613	we all agree on.
8944653	8946916	This is a concrete way to do that.
8948018	8958052	It also takes land not just for our benefit in ridership, but also puts improvements on it that helps the tax base.
8958473	8972353	And I think the communities that we serve would rather see a housing project end up on that property where it becomes improved.
8972333	8973815	versus somewhere else.
8973835	8975136	We're not the only game in town.
8975176	8976778	There's a lot of discounts out there.
8977518	8983505	And so we're not necessarily in a tight buyers market.
8983645	8985907	There's a lot of projects that can go forward.
8986588	8994797	And I think we need to put our best deal, at least give Chessie and the rest of the team the tools to bring the deal forward.
8995758	8997279	I do want to put one plug in.
8997319	8998180	We talked about it.
8998481	9000703	I don't think round leases
9000683	9003386	are the best tool in Colorado.
9003426	9006791	First of all, it's not as common as other places in the world.
9007431	9015642	And the other thing is toward the end of your ground lease, no matter how long you make it, the property will fall into disrepair.
9015942	9021409	They are not going to put money into physical facilities that are going to roll off their books.
9021389	9029080	So, for that reason, I like the discount is great and I love a sale versus a ground lease.
9029100	9031383	And I know you'll keep that in mind as we go forward.
9032084	9039876	And anyway, that's another argument in favor of that tactic.
9039896	9040456	Director Bill Arson.
9042399	9042860	Thank you.
9043100	9046485	I'm going to be a no vote on this.
9046938	9050763	I don't agree with our transit oriented development policy as it is right now.
9050983	9057752	I don't agree with the goal of trying to provide affordable housing or encourage it, incentivize it.
9058132	9062198	I think we should be focused on trying to increase ridership.
9062218	9071950	If we want to provide discounts on our land, we should provide them with the goal in mind of increasing the number of people that can live
9072335	9077220	on the property, whatever is developed, and the amount of traffic that is on the property.
9078381	9080823	So I'm a no on this.
9081504	9082404	Thank you, Director Larson.
9082545	9082845	All right.
9083265	9085247	The indication there is a no vote.
9085587	9087109	I am going to do a roll call vote.
9087189	9090332	As a reminder, we are voting on Director Nicholson's amendment.
9090832	9093755	He was the mover and Director Harwick is the second.
9094536	9095256	Treasure banker.
9098620	9098800	Yes.
9098820	9099440	Director Catlin.
9100922	9101262	Yes.
9102068	9102869	Director Keisinger?
9103189	9103750	Yes.
9103770	9104571	Director Gucinander?
9105092	9105612	Yes.
9105632	9106313	Director Guzman?
9106594	9107735	No.
9107755	9108396	Director Harwick?
9108556	9108796	Yes.
9109717	9110458	Director Larsen?
9111419	9111620	No.
9112721	9113922	Secretary Nicholson?
9113942	9114183	Yes.
9115064	9115905	First Vice-Chair O'Keefe?
9116706	9116926	Yes.
9117487	9118268	Director Pagulari?
9118748	9119009	Yes.
9119569	9120210	Director Ruscha?
9122873	9123454	Sorry, no.
9124375	9125797	And finally, Second Vice-Chair Whitmore?
9126358	9126658	Yes.
9127465	9138662	Okay, and I am a yes, that amendment will pass 10, two, excuse me, 10, three and two.
9140845	9145652	Yes, 10, yes, three, no, two absent, that is the math.
9146253	9152663	Okay, moving on, we are gonna do our second amendment, which was brought forward by Director Ruscha.
9154128	9157552	And Director Ruscha, would you like to introduce the language of the amendment?
9159454	9162358	It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman.
9163038	9170067	And I think he has the language in front of him.
9170087	9171208	Director Guzman.
9171228	9172209	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
9172249	9183342	We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end of this policy that says, additionally, no project will be eligible for any discounts unless it complies with the greater of the following.
9184148	9195530	5% of all units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities and an additional 2% of all units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities or to current U.S.
9195550	9198616	Department of Housing, Urban Development Accessibility requirements.
9200921	9201702	Do you have a second?
9202745	9203766	We have Russia's second.
9204828	9205910	Uh, Mr. Crow.
9205930	9206270	I'm sorry.
9206631	9218207	Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the highlighted portion above would be deleted and is not included in your motion.
9218267	9218648	Correct?
9218748	9219089	Correct.
9221973	9222133	Correct.
9222153	9225879	So the language we see, this would substitute the language.
9226419	9226720	Okay.
9226880	9227180	Perfect.
9227601	9231907	Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get this done.
9231927	9232448	Director Russia.
9233913	9238800	I was happy to speak to motion, but I wasn't sure if we were, I'm tired.
9239100	9239461	Is that okay?
9240502	9240602	Okay.
9240622	9244728	I got Guzman as the mover and Risha as the second and we're up for a conversation.
9244808	9244989	Okay.
9245009	9245730	You're up, Dr. Risha.
9246090	9246511	Thank you, sir.
9246551	9246831	Okay.
9246851	9263194	So just for everyone's identification, we struck the first sentence, it was a two sentence amendment, just recognizing that we didn't have full staff concurrence on the first sentence, which would have applied this accessibility minimum to market rate housing.
9263174	9268001	And sometimes you shoot for the stars and land on the moon.
9269003	9276434	The second sentence, which just applies the HUD requirement to affordable housing, we did get staff concurrence.
9276454	9278978	So that's just the, that was the context behind that.
9280741	9282263	I sent out like a
9283390	9290701	I kind of frequently ask questions in anticipation of some questions, so I'm happy to entertain any or we can address them.
9291202	9312553	I will say that we worked for three weeks and some change on this with housing advocates and folks who had worked in the space and people who had worked at CHAFA and at the state level on similar policy and advocacy organizations and then staff and legal.
9312955	9322209	So, I mean, just, I'm sorry, I am tired, too.
9322469	9334407	In case anybody has any questions about what this is, I think just simplify it and say that HUD has a
9334673	9338438	current minimum accessibility requirement for funding, right?
9338538	9347108	And it's 5% of units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, additional 2% of units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities.
9347909	9355538	And so a lot of times in these projects, that HUD requirement is going to kick in, but not all projects are going to have HUD dollars.
9356139	9361305	So just recognizing that a lot of jurisdictions take that HUD standard, which is
9361522	9366267	I maybe miss Brady can correct me, but I think it's 20 plus years old, 30 plus years old now.
9366868	9371913	Um, and they also incorporate that into their policies or their code or statute.
9372193	9375016	We did the same kind of good for goose, good for gander.
9375797	9378059	Um, I will stop there.
9378079	9387529	Uh, unless anyone else has further questions or, or comment questions or comments on this amendment, uh, Dr. Catlin and then secretary Nicholson.
9388910	9404835	I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the First Amendment that we passed does give a lot of latitude towards Chessie and her staff to negotiate.
9405556	9413989	And I fear that this one might be a little bit too regulatory and prescriptive.
9415707	9425740	If that's the HUD requirement and somebody is applying for a HUD grant, then this would be taken care of automatically.
9426341	9435453	So right now I'm willing to listen to other discussions, but I fear that it would not give Ms.
9435493	9442643	Brady and her staff the maximum flexibility to look at the comprehensive merits of a proposal.
9445441	9447002	Um, yeah, Ms.
9447022	9448444	Spriby.
9448464	9448664	Yeah.
9448824	9461496	So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver already requires, for example, and the Colorado Department of Housing is already considering a higher threshold of requirement.
9461576	9464378	So I have, I have no concerns about incorporating this.
9464458	9468122	I think it, it's already going to be taken care of in most cases.
9468522	9471164	If I might, that's kind of my point.
9471265	9472866	It seems a little bit redundant.
9476339	9477140	Secretary Nicholson.
9478223	9481388	I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's all right.
9482991	9483573	To the amendment.
9483753	9484174	Thank you.
9485396	9486799	Just to clarify, that was a question.
9486919	9488622	You would like to offer an amendment to the amendment?
9488983	9489143	Yes.
9490666	9491327	Let's have an amendment.
9491543	9492985	Mr. Krull.
9493005	9521382	Technically the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy and this is an amendment to that amendment and at this point you would be amending an amendment to an amendment which is not allowed under Robert's rules so you would need to tackle this amendment as it's being presented and then if you feel so inclined offer an amendment to whatever state the
9521362	9547437	uh policy is in at that point rock on uh secretary yeah so at that point i would say i'd have to be a no been for the very simple reason um where it says no project will be eligible we're talking about an uh equitable tod policy here um which is specifically focused on using our land to facilitate like the literally the policy is about giving discounts um i can't see
9547417	9570437	putting something like this in there unless it is related to said discount so I'd be fine if it said additionally no project receiving a discount will be eligible for any discounts etc unless it complies with but I don't necessarily think it makes sense to do market rate policy in an etod policy thank you secretary i have treasurer banker and then director isha
9570637	9571959	It's just real quick.
9571999	9585199	Have you perhaps considered something more positive saying something like along the lines greater consideration would be given a project if these items were attained as opposed to make it mandatory?
9588183	9589786	Dr. Risha or Dr. Kisman?
9589806	9592189	Again, sort of an amendment, but just a thought.
9592970	9593111	Thanks.
9593131	9597437	So I just want to address what Secretary Nicholson said.
9597856	9605885	I might have missed part of the closed captioning, but I think you said you don't think we should be applying accessibility minimums to market rate.
9606826	9607047	Okay.
9607387	9607988	That's exact.
9608188	9608508	We don't.
9608829	9609690	So this amendment doesn't do that.
9610090	9623226	And the second piece, um, the reason why I didn't say it doesn't reference discounts is because, uh, so this goes at the end of the policy, which is all, like the way it's nested under the paragraph, the discount, this is talking about when discounts apply, if that makes sense.
9623606	9624387	So it's just,
9625902	9629167	It does what you said you wanted it to do.
9629187	9630128	It's just late.
9630669	9631190	On Nicholson.
9631410	9631751	Thank you.
9632171	9636358	And then the, I guess the only question I have for, and this is actually for Ms.
9636398	9637900	Brady, if that's okay.
9638401	9650138	Under what, because you mentioned that Denver has a policy that supersede or that matches this and the state currently is considering a policy that would supersede it, but currently does not.
9650675	9654661	Under what circumstances would this have any effect at all?
9654841	9662933	Like in what circumstances can you imagine in your professional capacity, do you see this being something that would matter?
9664034	9664194	Ms.
9664234	9664515	Brady?
9665276	9669682	Yes, in a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units.
9669842	9675070	And Director Rush has mentioned some, I'm not aware of them, but this is not my area of expertise.
9675090	9680057	So, but in a jurisdiction that does not already have those requirements that is not
9680257	9693936	accepting HUD money, and if Colorado Department of Housing changes their rules, does not accept Department of Housing money, then that project would then be subject to this policy requirement.
9695819	9696239	Thank you, Ms.
9696280	9696560	Breedy.
9696880	9697702	Secretary, quickly.
9698543	9710179	Yeah, just, I guess, for Director Rusher, Director Guzman, are there any jurisdictions in the RTD service area that don't have that same requirement that Denver does?
9712100	9712901	either directors?
9714303	9718991	Yeah, I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate jurisdictions.
9719051	9727383	So I'm just going to have to lean into this is E TOD and the E is equitable.
9727904	9733292	We spend a lot of time talking about equity today, including spending a significant amount of time talking about people with disabilities.
9733813	9739542	And so just again, recognizing that the HUD requirement
9742610	9758492	is about equity and not excluding people on the basis of disability from accessing affordable housing because the FH Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and other areas of anti-discrimination law, including state law, don't effectively
9758995	9760377	covered that aspect.
9761599	9763041	Sorry, that was more than what you asked.
9763061	9765125	But no, I can't answer your question.
9766867	9777083	Just like you probably couldn't answer my question about every single jurisdiction in the RTD region that has something regarding parking minimums.
9778024	9779126	It's a broad concept.
9780528	9781290	Thank you, Director Usha.
9781730	9783773	Any further conversation on this amendment?
9784915	9785636	Dr. Guzman.
9785656	9787399	I will offer this last thing.
9787733	9801912	and then we probably should go to a vote, but very simply put, we need to make sure that we are protecting the vulnerable, providing access to these housing units.
9802193	9805477	Even in the city and county of Denver's building codes is not clear.
9805537	9806839	It's as clear as mud.
9807140	9813326	There is reference to this if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not necessarily required.
9813366	9822155	We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to get licensed.
9822836	9835408	And so to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units, I would like to see this in the policy.
9835591	9848383	I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement that's established.
9848423	9860655	And although it is established in other places, it is not established in our policy, and we are the government of this region, and we should take it seriously that we have a due diligence and responsibility to those members of our community that would need this.
9860875	9863117	Thank you.
9864683	9870373	I always have to follow you, Director Guzman, but obviously I'm very in support.
9870633	9881672	Any time that we can be supportive of our communities most in need, those suffering from a whole variety of disabilities, I want to be able to put our best foot forward there.
9882113	9886540	And while we can't call specific jurisdictions, if there is that
9886520	9893495	chance that there is a jurisdiction that isn't meeting this requirement, then we should make sure we're getting there.
9893555	9899087	And if in the process the state comes up with something better or something in the future, that's okay.
9899448	9906503	But I think that this is a safety net in my mind about how to really get there for this community.
9908727	9925158	I think that also, as we're tying these developments, spur off around our transit, that's also giving them better access to the resources and giving them the life that they want and the freedom of movement that we so cherish.
9925218	9927242	So I'm highly in support of this.
9927222	9927562	Thank you.
9928043	9929304	Secretary, less than 30 seconds.
9930606	9934170	This question is for Chessie.
9934410	9942299	My understanding with this language is that it applies to buildings with elevators in it.
9942419	9956976	And so with single stair buildings, that there are different policies around equitable access because of the challenges, obviously, in a single stair building of getting people into the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth floor.
9957277	9960686	You're probably the biggest expert on this in the room.
9961869	9973159	Do you see any concerns with this language when it comes to buildings with stairs only versus elevators?
9973865	9983579	I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable, I do know that equitable access and accessible units are different things and have different requirements.
9984400	9987885	And so we're talking specifically about accessible units.
9989207	9995476	We're also not, we're tending to be talking about larger buildings because we do want them to be dense at stations.
9995497	10000183	So I think they're typically going to be elevator buildings, but I don't have any concerns about that.
10000203	10000584	Thank you, Ms.
10000604	10000864	Brady.
10001365	10002707	Let's do the roll call vote.
10002940	10007687	Again, this is the amendment offered by Director Guzman and Director Rusha.

10132709	10134050	Director Guzman.
10134070	10134671	I got one quick.
10134711	10135031	Sorry.
10135532	10143519	Thank you, Mr. Chair, for approving the travel consideration for lodging and assistance to go to the NTI public engagement course in Florida.
10144600	10150706	Really packed, but came in really handy because as soon as I returned, we held the town hall to do exactly what I was sent to go learn about.
10150886	10151967	So I appreciate that.
10152527	10157712	And I was grateful for the assistance from staff and from Director Ruscha to be able to host that town hall.
10157732	10157932	Thanks.
10159434	10161375	Thank you, Director Guzman.
10161395	10162176	Secretary Nicholson.
10162358	10168806	I just wanted to flag that this weekend is the reopening of downtown celebration on Saturday and Sunday.
10168906	10176795	So if you like RTD, please come take it to downtown and enjoy our lovely food and all the other cool stuff.
10176936	10180580	Most of them all is back and running and we're very excited about it.
10181481	10182082	Any other matters?
10183223	10184104	Okay, I got a quick one.
10184124	10186527	It's only going to take 19 minutes.
10188346	10188907	Just joking.
10189288	10193656	My only other matter is please make sure that you, uh, directors fill out that form.

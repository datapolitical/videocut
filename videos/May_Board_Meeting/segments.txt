[692.12 - 698.69] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Director Catlin.
[699.35 - 706.86] Peggy Catlin: Thank you. And thank you for a very clear presentation. Although I have one question of

[713.05 - 719.31] Peggy Catlin: That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later. Thank you.
[719.95 - 723.38] Julien Bouquet: OK. Secretary Nicholson.
[724.76 - 743.80] Chris Nicholson: Thank you very much. I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more
[743.82 - 749.47] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Secretary. Director Ruscha.
[750.50 - 758.55] Joyann Ruscha: Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I just wanted to offer a bit of context. And the General
[758.59 - 765.49] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director. Director Larsen.
[765.51 - 769.08] Matt Larsen: Thank you. I just have a question for Ms. Vallejos. So I seen one of these slides that it
[770.90 - 775.83] Erin Vallejos: No, that would be for the year, I believe. Let me--
[775.91 - 780.30] Matt Larsen: As of. OK. As of. So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year. That's it? And so I
[780.84 - 786.67] Erin Vallejos: And I-- go ahead, Debra. Oh.
[790.50 - 791.22] Debra Johnson: So if I can, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question. I would not
[792.02 - 802.66] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Any other Directors, comments? Yeah, Director Guzman.
[803.20 - 810.03] Michael Guzman: I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area. District C is fairly
[810.01 - 820.69] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director. Director Harwick.
[820.73 - 826.32] Ian Harwick: Well, thank you, Director Guzman. I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you
[828.14 - 830.14] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director Harwick. Ms. Johnson.
[831.25 - 831.67] Debra Johnson: Yes. Director Harwick, if I understood you correctly, because I'm taking copious notes
[832.17 - 833.89] Julien Bouquet: Thank you.
[833.95 - 834.39] Ian Harwick: Yeah, but I also want to keep the service areas the same as they are today. Yeah.
[835.33 - 837.46] Julien Bouquet: Excellent. Director Nicholson, then Director Ruscha.
[837.80 - 838.64] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, just a quick follow up onto that. When it comes to-- go to Director Ruscha. My
[839.76 - 844.55] Julien Bouquet: All right. Director Ruscha.
[845.43 - 857.93] Joyann Ruscha: Thank you for the Red Rover. I wasn't prepared. I went back to my notes. OK. So
[858.67 - 864.12] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director Ruscha. Director Nicholson.
[864.10 - 889.87] Chris Nicholson: Thank you. Is there any step during enrollment of AAR and AOD where we ask
[890.36 - 895.92] Erin Vallejos: I will have to find out about that as part of the process, and we will confirm if that is how
[896.47 - 904.86] Chris Nicholson: Yeah. So yeah, as a first thing, I would say that since we're going to be updating this

[920.66 - 935.65] Debra Johnson: First, if I may. Just for everyone's edification, probably you have heard this over the
[936.39 - 938.35] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director.
[938.37 - 943.20] Erin Vallejos: And I don't think I need to add anything. That was really exactly what I was going to say.
[944.20 - 953.25] Matt Larsen: Can I just follow up? But I mean, surely many more people than 3,000 in the metro area
[956.79 - 957.37] Erin Vallejos: Well, and again, we have continued to see substantial growth in the number of customers
[959.98 - 963.30] Julien Bouquet: Thank you.
[963.34 - 963.90] Matt Larsen: Thank you.

[1252.58 - 1265.27] Julien Bouquet: Director Benker, I'm sorry to interrupt. Just so that we keep an order, could we get a
[1265.74 - 1270.81] Karen Benker: The motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact
[1271.11 - 1272.05] Julien Bouquet: So that's the language right there. The first motion is to move to amend the 2025-2028

[1275.07 - 1289.43] Julien Bouquet: Paglieri is the second. Thank you.

[1299.31 - 1301.75] Peggy Catlin: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to ask GM/CEO Johnson. I heard from someone-- I don't
[1301.81 - 1303.62] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Johnson. Yes thank you very much relative to the comments that were made--
[1304.52 - 1310.25] Carl Green: Yes. Thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson. To expand upon the
[1310.27 - 1313.41] Julien Bouquet: I have Director Ruscha next.
[1313.39 - 1322.19] Joyann Ruscha: OK. I did have a question, but also Treasurer Benker had her hand up, and it was her
[1322.53 - 1326.45] Julien Bouquet: Treasurer Benker?
[1327.39 - 1331.52] Karen Benker: I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic. So how can
[1331.88 - 1337.39] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Johnson.
[1337.79 - 1338.13] Debra Johnson: Yes, thank you very much. Director Benker, that question is better suited for me.
[1340.11 - 1341.17] Karen Benker: OK. But if I can--
[1342.51 - 1344.59] Julien Bouquet: Treasurer, yeah.
[1344.61 - 1345.41] Karen Benker: Some of the issues that you just raised are important. There's no doubt. However, I don't
[1346.35 - 1353.88] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Johnson.
[1356.37 - 1360.31] Debra Johnson: Thank you. There's a couple of external factors that play into that quite naturally. When
[1360.71 - 1369.69] Julien Bouquet: Director Ruscha.
[1370.13 - 1383.77] Joyann Ruscha: Thank you, sir. So I have a question for legal. So recognizing this has to be submitted
[1386.26 - 1398.60] Debra Johnson: I will address that question and then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound. I think if anything,
[1399.48 - 1404.62] Carl Green: Yes. Thank you so much, GM/CEO Johnson. Oh. Apologies. Apologies.
[1405.85 - 1416.12] Julien Bouquet: Sensitive microphone.
[1416.45 - 1430.93] Carl Green: Yes. Apologies. But to piggyback off of what GM/CEO Johnson has noted, I would couch
[1430.95 - 1432.64] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Director Ruscha? OK. Director Guissinger and then Director Larsen. Oh,
[1433.11 - 1446.55] Matt Larsen: Thank you. I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were
[1447.51 - 1454.08] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Ms. Johnson.
[1454.54 - 1459.35] Debra Johnson: Thank you very much. The one thing I would share, Director Larsen, is we look at the
[1460.58 - 1468.37] Julien Bouquet: Director Larsen.
[1469.37 - 1478.38] Matt Larsen: But it just seems like, when I was reading the documents, that there's always a legitimate
[1478.92 - 1481.61] Debra Johnson: I'm sorry. Thank you for the question. For me, I've only been here for five years, and I
[1482.13 - 1492.69] Carl Green: Yeah, I would just highlight, Chairman, if I may. Since January 2023, there was about 270
[1493.25 - 1496.01] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Director? OK. I had Director Harwick. And just as a reminder, we're
[1497.40 - 1500.64] Ian Harwick: Mine will be comments about this but also moving forward as well, because I am in support
[1501.03 - 1502.05] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director. Any further conversation on this amendment? Secretary
[1503.19 - 1508.70] Chris Nicholson: So this is for our deputy General Counsel. If we were to pass this tonight, what's the
[1509.62 - 1512.14] Julien Bouquet: In regards to the amendment, Secretary?
[1512.18 - 1518.30] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[1518.68 - 1543.56] Julien Bouquet: OK. Deputy Counsel.
[1544.57 - 1546.91] Melanie Snyder: There we go. Excuse me. Thank you, Director Nicholson. I don't have concerns.
[1547.26 - 1548.48] Julien Bouquet: Secretary.
[1548.50 - 1552.99] Chris Nicholson: That is all.
[1553.17 - 1553.48] Julien Bouquet: Yeah, Treasurer Benker.
[1554.06 - 1554.76] Karen Benker: Here is where I do not understand. In 2019, we had the service. My area, my district, as
[1555.44 - 1556.14] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Johnson.
[1557.14 - 1559.42] Debra Johnson: So thank you, Director Benker. What I'm going to say goes back to the previous
[1559.44 - 1561.75] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Director Guzman and then Director Guissinger.
[1561.77 - 1571.16] Michael Guzman: So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight, getting back to the motion
[1571.36 - 1572.56] Carl Green: Chair, OK for me?
[1572.64 - 1573.51] Julien Bouquet: Absolutely, Mr. Green.
[1574.17 - 1579.64] Carl Green: If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear, and if you
[1580.20 - 1582.84] Michael Guzman: Thank you. I would just urge a no vote, and let's move on to the policy.
[1583.39 - 1585.44] Julien Bouquet: All right. Director Guissinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this
[1585.56 - 1590.48] Lynn Guissinger: I'll be super quick. That last explanation that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of
[1590.50 - 1606.90] Julien Bouquet: Mr. Green.
[1607.41 - 1612.90] Carl Green: Yeah, that's a great follow up question. I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when
[1612.96 - 1624.10] Lynn Guissinger: Thank you.
[1625.01 - 1627.45] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. All right, let's do a roll call vote. As a reminder, it is the first amendment
[1627.61 - 1640.82] Karen Benker: Yes.
[1641.88 - 1650.07] Julien Bouquet: Director Buzek is gone. Director Catlin.
[1650.05 - 1677.56] Peggy Catlin: No.
[1677.54 - 1692.32] Julien Bouquet: Director Guissinger.
[1692.42 - 1699.61] Lynn Guissinger: No.

[1700.95 - 1701.67] Chris Gutschenritter: No.
[1701.87 - 1702.03] Julien Bouquet: Director Guzman.
[1702.05 - 1702.47] Michael Guzman: No.

[1729.66 - 1731.97] Julien Bouquet: Director Nicholson.
[1731.99 - 1732.29] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[1733.55 - 1735.49] Julien Bouquet: First Vice Chair O'Keefe.
[1737.04 - 1740.70] Patrick O'Keefe: No.
[1741.68 - 1749.06] Julien Bouquet: Director Paglieri.
[1750.34 - 1751.10] Brett Paglieri: No.

[1759.38 - 1759.80] Troy Whitmore: No.
[1759.82 - 1774.31] Julien Bouquet: I'm a yes, but the motion will fail. And we have 3 to 10. OK. Moving on. Yes, Director?
[1774.76 - 1792.08] Karen Benker: I would like to withdraw the next two amendments.
[1792.18 - 1795.13] Julien Bouquet: Next two amendments?
[1795.43 - 1799.34] Karen Benker: Yes.
[1799.68 - 1810.56] Julien Bouquet: OK. The next two amendments have been withdrawn.
[1810.96 - 1812.60] Chris Nicholson: They were never introduced, so they're not really withdrawn. But now you would
[1813.36 - 1818.55] Julien Bouquet: Excellent. Back to the main motion at hand. Director O'Keefe.
[1820.34 - 1832.90] Patrick O'Keefe: So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on this action. There's a few things going
[1833.28 - 1841.73] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director O'Keefe. Any further comments or questions on the main motion?
[1841.89 - 1843.23] Michael Guzman: I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously submitted a
[1843.39 - 1844.41] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director Guzman. Director Larsen.
[1844.86 - 1848.20] Matt Larsen: I'm going to be a no vote, I think it's kind of, like I said, we're constraining our freedom to
[1849.01 - 1853.46] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director Larsen. Secretary Nicholson.
[1855.10 - 1860.01] Chris Nicholson: So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session, and a town hall, all on
[1860.41 - 1864.88] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Any further comments on the main motion? OK. Seeing none, we had
[1865.96 - 1868.86] Karen Benker: No.

[2025.43 - 2026.76] Julien Bouquet: I'm also a yes. So the motion, the main motion will pass 11, 2, and 2 absent. Yes. That
[2028.12 - 2042.98] Michael Guzman: So moved, Guzman.
[2043.00 - 2046.98] Julien Bouquet: Guzman is the mover. Do I have a second?
[2047.72 - 2053.91] Troy Whitmore: Second.
[2053.95 - 2055.07] Julien Bouquet: I have--
[2059.84 - 2062.43] Joyann Ruscha: Wait. Sir.
[2062.83 - 2067.73] Julien Bouquet: Yeah?
[2068.86 - 2069.07] Joyann Ruscha: Oh, wait. Well, I could be wrong. I'm sorry, I forgot we started late. I thought we hit our
[2069.16 - 2079.45] Julien Bouquet: Oh.
[2079.51 - 2087.98] Joyann Ruscha: Sorry.
[2088.23 - 2092.59] Julien Bouquet: Guzman is the mover. Whitmore is the second. Any discussion on it? Yeah, Director
[2092.65 - 2099.22] Brett Paglieri: I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting for this. I was not
[2099.34 - 2105.89] Julien Bouquet: Any further conversation? Secretary Nicholson.
[2105.91 - 2108.29] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, so I understand the importance of what we're doing here. I think that these
[2108.33 - 2117.66] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Johnson, is 51 million enough to make them not suck?
[2118.22 - 2134.30] Debra Johnson: Yeah. So thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you for the question.
[2134.28 - 2137.64] Julien Bouquet: My apologies. That was unprofessional.
[2137.72 - 2140.97] Debra Johnson: Keep it in mind, this is a budget transfer. And full transparency, Director Nicholson
[2140.99 - 2145.11] Chris Nicholson: 24.
[2145.17 - 2147.71] Debra Johnson: How many?
[2148.03 - 2158.52] Chris Nicholson: 24.
[2158.76 - 2159.74] Debra Johnson: 23. I think I told you that earlier. So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this,
[2160.18 - 2162.35] Julien Bouquet: Secretary.
[2162.33 - 2175.02] Chris Nicholson: I really appreciate it and I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how

[2177.28 - 2184.65] Julien Bouquet: Director Guzman.

[2186.32 - 2186.47] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director. Any further discussion on this item? All right. There is a no-- oh,

[2245.57 - 2251.46] Peggy Catlin: What?
[2252.94 - 2259.50] Chris Nicholson: Sorry that was a bad internet ref-- yes.
[2259.52 - 2271.05] Julien Bouquet: Nicholson is a yes. Director O'Keefe.

[2328.78 - 2333.16] Jack Kroll: Chairman Bouquet, could you remind us over here? We missed who the mover and the
[2333.22 - 2338.85] Julien Bouquet: I had Guzman and Whitmore.
[2339.25 - 2340.63] Jack Kroll: OK. Thank you.
[2341.29 - 2342.21] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. OK. Excellent. Thank you all again for your patience. We do have one
[2342.23 - 2349.16] Michael Guzman: So moved, Guzman.
[2350.68 - 2355.45] Julien Bouquet: Guzman is the mover. Do we have a second?
[2355.86 - 2360.29] Ian Harwick: Second.
[2360.75 - 2367.62] Julien Bouquet: I have Harwick as the second. I do understand that on this item, we have some
[2370.76 - 2371.08] Chris Nicholson: Yes. I'd like to move to amend the ETOD policy. And I'm hoping that GM/CEO-- not
[2371.26 - 2371.58] Speaker: It's there.
[2372.39 - 2372.69] Chris Nicholson: Great. May I?
[2373.93 - 2375.39] Julien Bouquet: Would you like to read the motion and then we'll get a second?
[2377.63 - 2377.81] Chris Nicholson: Thank you. Yeah. So move to amend the policy such that Section 5 of the equitable
[2377.87 - 2378.61] Julien Bouquet: Excellent.
[2378.63 - 2380.64] Jack Kroll: Do we have a second?
[2380.68 - 2382.96] Julien Bouquet: And do we have a second on that?
[2383.42 - 2384.10] Ian Harwick: Second.
[2384.72 - 2385.82] Julien Bouquet: Harwick is the second. Secretary, would you like to discuss further?
[2385.86 - 2388.71] Chris Nicholson: Thank you. Yes. Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll
[2388.75 - 2391.73] Jack Kroll: Yes. So four of the written public comment items were submitted by individuals specifically
[2391.77 - 2394.16] Julien Bouquet: Perfect. Secretary.
[2394.68 - 2404.35] Chris Nicholson: Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Executive Manager Kroll. So here at RTD, we make
[2404.37 - 2404.73] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Director Harwick.
[2405.01 - 2405.31] Ian Harwick: Yeah. So I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD, that we're really
[2405.81 - 2406.39] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director Harwick. Any further discussion on this amendment? Director
[2406.80 - 2410.18] Joyann Ruscha: Mr. Chair, maybe you can help me here. So I had a comment, but I had a comment on
[2411.92 - 2412.06] Julien Bouquet: You know what? Why not? Let's give it a try.
[2412.10 - 2412.48] Joyann Ruscha: OK, thanks. I'm doing my best. So this morning, we got an email from staff that
[2412.78 - 2414.75] Julien Bouquet: Thank you. Thank you, Director Ruscha. Director Guzman.
[2414.81 - 2417.32] Michael Guzman: So ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee, and this is my
[2417.60 - 2419.71] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Brady. First off, thank you for your patience and greatly appreciate you sticking
[2420.01 - 2422.61] Chessy Brady: Of course.
[2422.63 - 2425.28] Julien Bouquet: You're recognized.
[2425.70 - 2426.30] Chessy Brady: Thank you. No, there is nothing that would stop us from doing that. As you say, the point
[2426.98 - 2427.68] Karen Benker: Thank you. One more quick thing. And Director Benker, Treasurer Benker, the sales
[2428.90 - 2429.22] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director. Director Paglieri.
[2429.30 - 2430.38] Brett Paglieri: Thank you. I'll be brief. I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply
[2430.42 - 2430.86] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director. Treasurer Benker.
[2431.82 - 2432.10] Karen Benker: Just a quick question. Some of the surplus properties that we're talking about, we are
[2432.38 - 2432.93] Chessy Brady: Thank you. So this policy is aimed at transit oriented development. So property that RTD
[2432.99 - 2435.27] Karen Benker: OK.
[2435.57 - 2441.72] Chessy Brady: Yes.
[2441.76 - 2445.20] Julien Bouquet: Secretary Nicholson.
[2445.76 - 2449.49] Chris Nicholson: I actually have some questions for Ms. Brady. So first off, Director Paglieri raised the
[2450.11 - 2452.27] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Brady.
[2452.29 - 2453.27] Chessy Brady: Sure, yes. Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means
[2454.21 - 2455.01] Julien Bouquet: Secretary.
[2455.05 - 2456.68] Chris Nicholson: So second question. I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as a discount. I was
[2456.72 - 2458.52] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Brady.
[2459.10 - 2460.20] Chessy Brady: Thank you. So affordable housing projects are notoriously difficult to finance. And I think
[2460.58 - 2461.28] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Ms. Brady. We're going to wrap up with Director O'Keefe and then Director
[2461.30 - 2461.98] Patrick O'Keefe: Oh, I thought I got last word. So I support this amendment. I think it is a reasonable
[2463.94 - 2466.39] Julien Bouquet: Director Larsen.
[2466.81 - 2467.47] Matt Larsen: Thank you. I'm going to be a no vote on this. I don't agree with our transit oriented
[2468.67 - 2476.22] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director Larsen. All right. With the indication there is a no vote, I am going
[2476.96 - 2483.55] Karen Benker: Yes.
[2483.66 - 2485.12] Julien Bouquet: Director Catlin.
[2485.82 - 2494.01] Peggy Catlin: Yes.
[2495.78 - 2507.07] Julien Bouquet: Director Guissinger.

[2568.34 - 2570.25] Julien Bouquet: Director Ruscha.
[2570.29 - 2579.00] Joyann Ruscha: Sorry, no.
[2579.78 - 2583.24] Julien Bouquet: And finally, Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
[2584.28 - 2588.41] Troy Whitmore: Yes.
[2588.84 - 2593.87] Julien Bouquet: And I am a yes. That amendment will pass 10, 2-- excuse me. 10, 3, and 2. Yes. 10
[2594.69 - 2596.93] Joyann Ruscha: It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman, and I--
[2597.65 - 2608.17] Michael Guzman: I can make the motion. Sorry.
[2608.15 - 2611.49] Joyann Ruscha: I think he has the language in front of him.
[2612.25 - 2619.59] Julien Bouquet: Director Guzman.
[2620.19 - 2631.40] Michael Guzman: Thank you, Mr. Chair. We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end
[2631.38 - 2643.48] Jack Kroll: Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the
[2644.38 - 2653.02] Michael Guzman: Correct.
[2653.80 - 2654.10] Julien Bouquet: So the language we see, this would substitute the language? OK, perfect.
[2654.56 - 2655.94] Michael Guzman: Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get this done.
[2656.38 - 2659.04] Julien Bouquet: Director Ruscha.
[2659.46 - 2660.06] Joyann Ruscha: I was happy to speak to the motion, but I wasn't sure if we were-- I'm tired. Is that OK?
[2660.72 - 2661.62] Julien Bouquet: Mhm.
[2662.04 - 2663.89] Joyann Ruscha: OK.
[2663.93 - 2679.65] Julien Bouquet: We got Guzman as the mover and Ruscha as the second, and we're up for
[2679.63 - 2692.12] Joyann Ruscha: OK.
[2692.64 - 2694.00] Julien Bouquet: You're up, Director Ruscha.
[2694.18 - 2697.45] Joyann Ruscha: Thank you sir. OK. So just for everyone's edification, we struck the first sentence. It
[2697.49 - 2699.43] Julien Bouquet: Questions or comments on this amendment? Director Catlin, then Secretary
[2700.01 - 2702.72] Peggy Catlin: I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the first amendment that we
[2703.02 - 2705.28] Julien Bouquet: Yeah, Ms. Brady.
[2706.06 - 2714.48] Chessy Brady: Would you like me to comment? So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver
[2714.85 - 2720.03] Peggy Catlin: If I might? That's kind of my point. It seems a little bit redundant.
[2720.61 - 2725.80] Julien Bouquet: Secretary Nicholson.
[2726.54 - 2727.04] Chris Nicholson: I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's all right.
[2727.20 - 2728.36] Julien Bouquet: To the Amendment?
[2729.48 - 2735.99] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[2736.11 - 2738.27] Julien Bouquet: Just to clarify, that was a question. You would like to offer an amendment to the
[2738.61 - 2743.33] Chris Nicholson: Yes. Sub-amendment.
[2743.87 - 2757.71] Julien Bouquet: Mr. Kroll?
[2759.13 - 2766.42] Jack Kroll: Technically, the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy, and this is an
[2767.36 - 2772.24] Julien Bouquet: Rock on. Secretary.
[2772.26 - 2781.75] Chris Nicholson: Yeah. So at that point, I would say I'd have to be a no for the very simple reason.
[2782.32 - 2786.40] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Secretary. Treasurer Benker and then Director Ruscha.
[2786.75 - 2793.68] Karen Benker: Just real quick. Have you perhaps considered something more positive, saying
[2794.10 - 2801.89] Julien Bouquet: Director Ruscha or Director Guzman.
[2802.09 - 2815.81] Karen Benker: Again, sort of an amendment, but just a thought.
[2816.27 - 2822.80] Joyann Ruscha: So I just want to address what Secretary Nicholson said. I might have missed part of
[2823.46 - 2833.02] Julien Bouquet: Nicholson.
[2833.06 - 2833.78] Chris Nicholson: Thank you. And then I guess the only question I have for-- and this is actually for Ms.
[2834.29 - 2835.59] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Brady.
[2836.43 - 2837.23] Chessy Brady: Yes. In a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units-- and Director Ruscha
[2838.05 - 2845.43] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Ms. Brady. Secretary.
[2846.15 - 2850.30] Chris Nicholson: Yeah. Just, I guess for Director Ruscha or Director Guzman. Are there any
[2853.51 - 2854.19] Julien Bouquet: Either Directors.
[2855.57 - 2855.91] Joyann Ruscha: Yeah. I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate
[2856.25 - 2862.74] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Director Ruscha. Any further conversation on this amendment. Director
[2863.38 - 2874.98] Michael Guzman: I will offer this last thing, and then we probably should go to a vote. But very simply
[2875.80 - 2881.99] Julien Bouquet: Director Harwick.
[2882.39 - 2883.25] Ian Harwick: I always have to follow you, Director Guzman. But obviously, I'm very in support. Any time
[2883.59 - 2884.67] Julien Bouquet: Secretary, less than 30 seconds.
[2885.59 - 2886.81] Chris Nicholson: This question is for Chessy. My understanding with this language is that it applies to
[2886.83 - 2887.11] Julien Bouquet: Ms. Brady.
[2887.29 - 2888.31] Chessy Brady: I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable-- I do know
[2891.70 - 2895.52] Julien Bouquet: Thank you, Ms. Brady. Let's do the roll call vote. Again, this is the amendment offered
[2895.66 - 2897.10] Peggy Catlin: No.
[2901.77 - 2902.39] Julien Bouquet: Director Guissinger.
[2902.41 - 2904.03] Lynn Guissinger: Yes.
[2904.19 - 2905.79] Julien Bouquet: Director Gutschenritter.

[2970.36 - 2976.45] Troy Whitmore: Yes.
[2976.49 - 2978.27] Julien Bouquet: I'm also a yes. So that'll pass. 1, 2, 3, 4. I think I got 10 yeses, 3 nos, and 2 absent.
[2978.47 - 2978.89] Jack Kroll: There are 4 nos.
[2980.14 - 2984.51] Julien Bouquet: Excuse me, four nos. Thank you.
[2984.53 - 2998.39] Jack Kroll: So 9, 4, and 2.
[3000.31 - 3009.10] Julien Bouquet: 9, 4 and 2. My apologies. We'll save that for the record. OK. Now moving on back to
[3009.45 - 3022.07] Karen Benker: Yes.
[3022.75 - 3033.05] Julien Bouquet: Director Catlin.

[3448.41 - 3449.07] Chris Nicholson: Very exciting.
[3449.41 - 3450.95] Chris Nicholson: And Kelly, welcome to the team.
[3451.47 - 3451.83] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[3454.66 - 3455.04] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[3455.56 - 3456.28] Chris Nicholson: Moving on.
[3456.30 - 3459.36] Chris Nicholson: Uh, they, we're going to move on to unanimous consent.
[3459.76 - 3470.06] Chris Nicholson: Uh, there are three items on the unanimous consent agenda listed under section 16 actions A through C. Those items are the security operations budget transfer.
[3470.27 - 3477.69] Chris Nicholson: The 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, and the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension for one year.
[3477.71 - 3485.53] Chris Nicholson: I do understand that Director Banker would like to offer some amendments to Item B, the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update.
[3485.95 - 3491.24] Chris Nicholson: And such I will remove, I will move that to a recommended actions, actions, excuse me.
[3491.82 - 3500.73] Chris Nicholson: If anyone else has a change to discussion on or questions about any of the remaining unanimous consent items, please feel free to advise the chair at this time.
[3501.11 - 3506.66] Chris Nicholson: And I'll of course be happy to pull the item from unanimous consent for consideration under recommended action.
[3507.76 - 3508.50] Chris Nicholson: Director Nicholson.
[3510.72 - 3513.48] Chris Nicholson: The Allied Universal Security Contract, please pull that.
[3514.09 - 3514.18] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[3514.54 - 3520.38] Chris Nicholson: So item B will be removed and placed into recommended action.
[3521.44 - 3527.77] Chris Nicholson: Excuse me, former item C, as I look in real time here, the Allied Universal Security.
[3527.97 - 3531.64] Chris Nicholson: Are we okay with security operations, budget transfer?
[3536.08 - 3540.51] Chris Nicholson: I would move to approve the remainder of the unanimous consent agenda.
[3540.89 - 3541.51] Chris Nicholson: Second.
[3541.67 - 3544.64] Chris Nicholson: Okay, I have Whitmore and then Roush as the second.
[3545.64 - 3566.08] Chris Nicholson: Okay, so this is item A for the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $3,845,437.10 between Operated Expenses Lines for Transit Security Services.
[3568.64 - 3571.22] Chris Nicholson: Is there any no votes on that?
[3573.55 - 3573.85] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[3575.47 - 3577.95] Chris Nicholson: Seeing none, that item will pass 14-0-1.
[3577.97 - 3584.60] Chris Nicholson: All right, now we're moving on to our recommended action items.
[3585.36 - 3591.47] Chris Nicholson: And we're gonna have first on our list, the Allied Universal Security Surface Contract Extension for one year.
[3591.51 - 3594.30] Chris Nicholson: Is there a motion?
[3595.30 - 3595.70] Chris Nicholson: So moved.
[3596.12 - 3596.74] Chris Nicholson: Okay, Nicholson.
[3598.14 - 3598.58] Chris Nicholson: In a second.
[3599.64 - 3600.08] Chris Nicholson: And Russia.
[3601.80 - 3602.04] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[3602.22 - 3602.94] Chris Nicholson: Any discussion.
[3604.12 - 3604.72] Chris Nicholson: Director Nicholson.
[3605.38 - 3605.56] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[3605.58 - 3608.97] Chris Nicholson: So I just have a quick question about this one that came from a constituent.
[3610.57 - 3617.76] Chris Nicholson: How many people do we have working from working on our security side from Allied?
[3618.26 - 3622.91] Chris Nicholson: And how many do we have from, you know, RTDPD right now?
[3623.73 - 3624.01] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[3625.25 - 3625.39] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[3625.41 - 3625.73] Chris Nicholson: Johnson.
[3626.33 - 3629.76] Chris Nicholson: Yes, I will yield the floor to Chief Martin Gano who can address that question.
[3629.80 - 3630.15] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[3632.74 - 3633.46] Chris Nicholson: Chief Martin Gano.
[3634.53 - 3637.48] Chris Nicholson: I am trying to figure out whether we're going to be hot chat for me.
[3638.32 - 3638.68] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[3638.70 - 3638.92] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[3638.94 - 3644.21] Chris Nicholson: So technically, in regards to how many ally personnel, it's an hourly contract.
[3644.55 - 3647.52] Chris Nicholson: So you'd have to take the amount of the hours and obviously divided by 40.
[3648.18 - 3651.85] Chris Nicholson: It roughly equates to the recommended action for next year.
[3651.87 - 3653.81] Chris Nicholson: I think it's about 9100 hours.
[3653.87 - 3657.00] Chris Nicholson: So roughly equates about 180 security officers.
[3656.98 - 3662.71] Chris Nicholson: Right now we currently have 87 on our staff in regards to post certified police officers.
[3663.05 - 3668.45] Chris Nicholson: We have a couple in training and one in the academy who should be probably about 90 by the end of next month.
[3669.95 - 3670.80] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, secretary.
[3673.76 - 3675.20] Chris Nicholson: This is for GMCO Johnson.
[3676.02 - 3678.77] Chris Nicholson: What are there any.
[3680.25 - 3684.84] Chris Nicholson: plans in place or is and please feel free to not answer this as we can't.
[3685.96 - 3692.07] Chris Nicholson: But I know there's been a drawdown over the last few years in our reliance on allied security.
[3692.11 - 3698.88] Chris Nicholson: Is there anything in this contract or in your planning around this contract or.
[3698.86 - 3713.82] Chris Nicholson: anything that can give us guidance on whether we expect that to continue after authorizing this, or are we expecting to stay at, you know, 90, 90 something hundred or 180 people over the next few years?
[3714.84 - 3715.08] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[3715.52 - 3716.81] Chris Nicholson: Thank you very much for the question.
[3716.95 - 3720.97] Chris Nicholson: As chief indicated, this is a contract extension and there's hours that are specified.
[3721.07 - 3726.44] Chris Nicholson: Hence, in reference to the dollar amount that we have here, I would have to come back to the board.
[3726.82 - 3732.63] Chris Nicholson: as it relates to any type of authorization as we're doing now currently with this contract extension, if that were to be modified.
[3732.87 - 3750.20] Chris Nicholson: So on this point in time, it would stay the same unless there's some extenuating circumstances whereby we go out for a solicitation and we're not able to ensure that we're meeting the timeline before, since that's why we're here now with the contract extension quite naturally in doing so.
[3750.28 - 3754.06] Chris Nicholson: We have to ensure that we have the appropriate staffing levels.
[3754.40 - 3759.58] Chris Nicholson: So, I'm talking around and around in circles right now, but the answer would be no at this point in time.
[3761.16 - 3761.55] Chris Nicholson: Secretary.
[3763.67 - 3764.73] Chris Nicholson: Perfect.
[3765.17 - 3766.09] Chris Nicholson: Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
[3767.17 - 3773.52] Chris Nicholson: So, Chief, jog my memory on our goal for the end of the year for sworn officers.
[3773.60 - 3774.80] Chris Nicholson: It's not 90, right?
[3774.82 - 3776.30] Chris Nicholson: It's continuing to grow.
[3776.86 - 3777.50] Chris Nicholson: Chief Morrigano.
[3777.60 - 3779.58] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, so we are budgeted for 150.
[3780.02 - 3782.67] Chris Nicholson: We're still in the process of growing to those numbers.
[3784.31 - 3790.86] Chris Nicholson: So obviously with applications, background checks, everything else, we're heading positively to that.
[3790.92 - 3792.88] Chris Nicholson: We're putting in more in the academy here in June.
[3792.94 - 3795.40] Chris Nicholson: We'll continue to get lateral transfers.
[3795.90 - 3799.83] Chris Nicholson: I'm sorry, lateral applications from other agencies, officers of experience.
[3799.85 - 3802.71] Chris Nicholson: So we're hoping to hit that 150 goal by the end of year.
[3802.73 - 3803.23] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[3803.25 - 3803.95] Chris Nicholson: Thank you very much.
[3803.97 - 3806.46] Chris Nicholson: I did have the right memory up here.
[3806.54 - 3807.44] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[3807.49 - 3809.03] Chris Nicholson: Absolutely.
[3809.13 - 3812.35] Chris Nicholson: Any further, well, any further questions or discussions on this?
[3813.29 - 3813.85] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, Director Riesha.
[3815.69 - 3816.03] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, sir.
[3816.11 - 3837.27] Chris Nicholson: So I just wanted to note in the in the past upon request, the agency has provided a breakdown of how many just like our security personnel from, you know, our city to contracted and even break down in terms of with our contracted Allied Force like
[3838.40 - 3843.99] Chris Nicholson: the ones that are authorized to have firearms versus not, and our mental health staff and stuff.
[3844.01 - 3850.30] Chris Nicholson: So that's something that I think the agency, I'm sure the agency would be happy to provide like that breakdown chart.
[3850.38 - 3852.24] Chris Nicholson: I think it's been a little over a year since we've had one.
[3852.72 - 3861.25] Chris Nicholson: So I just wanted to offer that to those who are interested and just to piggyback on Secretary Nicholson's comments.
[3862.43 - 3862.71] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[3863.37 - 3864.01] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Director.
[3866.34 - 3866.43] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[3866.46 - 3867.72] Chris Nicholson: Any further comments or questions?
[3869.32 - 3870.12] Chris Nicholson: Okay, seeing none.
[3870.24 - 3872.16] Chris Nicholson: So I did have, thank you, Chief.
[3872.96 - 3876.07] Chris Nicholson: I did have Nicholson as the mover and Roush as the second.
[3876.57 - 3878.57] Chris Nicholson: Are there any no votes on this item?
[3882.81 - 3886.74] Chris Nicholson: Okay, seeing none, the item will pass 14-0-1 absent.
[3887.58 - 3891.87] Chris Nicholson: We are hitting our two hour mark, so we are gonna take a break for our cart employee.
[3892.95 - 3896.15] Chris Nicholson: Let's shoot to be back here at nine o'clock.
[3896.29 - 3897.01] Chris Nicholson: Would that be enough time?
[3898.41 - 3898.75] Chris Nicholson: Nope.
[3898.77 - 3899.35] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[3899.37 - 3899.57] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[3899.59 - 3900.59] Chris Nicholson: Let's do 905 then.
[3901.15 - 3901.71] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[3901.73 - 3902.68] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[3902.70 - 3927.69] Chris Nicholson: We'll back at 905.
[3927.94 - 3954.93] Chris Nicholson: We've got it.
[3954.95 - 3955.22] Chris Nicholson: We've got it.
[3955.24 - 3955.43] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[3955.45 - 3955.74] Chris Nicholson: There are two.
[3955.76 - 3955.96] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[3957.81 - 3968.38] Chris Nicholson: not.
[3988.99 - 3990.54] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[3990.84 - 3991.28] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[3991.38 - 4011.10] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[4023.98 - 4025.04] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[4025.06 - 4027.32] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[4027.94 - 4047.32] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[4065.25 - 4070.62] Chris Nicholson: You know what it is.
[4112.00 - 4113.90] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[4114.38 - 4115.70] Chris Nicholson: But yeah.
[4117.06 - 4119.83] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[4120.45 - 4139.86] Chris Nicholson: I hear.
[4144.70 - 4172.06] Chris Nicholson: We had a tower backed up on Friday night.
[4172.41 - 4178.22] Chris Nicholson: And, uh, Senator, if you're in the hot quarter, so you know, it's not a big deal.
[4178.28 - 4183.63] Chris Nicholson: So, but if my daughter's school, no, they're out there, like an ankle thing.
[4183.77 - 4185.17] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4186.59 - 4187.27] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4187.41 - 4188.29] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4188.31 - 4189.78] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4189.80 - 4191.94] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4192.18 - 4193.78] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4193.96 - 4195.06] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4195.12 - 4196.19] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4196.37 - 4197.59] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[4212.25 - 4217.68] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[4219.94 - 4240.45] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[4240.87 - 4258.96] Chris Nicholson: You do it.
[4317.25 - 4326.72] Chris Nicholson: We're out of time.
[4327.08 - 4334.43] Chris Nicholson: We're out of time.
[4334.55 - 4345.80] Chris Nicholson: We're out of time
[4356.53 - 4357.97] Chris Nicholson: I'm sorry.
[4391.02 - 4418.90] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[4432.01 - 4452.23] Chris Nicholson: Thank you very much.
[4506.64 - 4507.92] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, we're gonna get started.
[4508.19 - 4511.43] Chris Nicholson: Have you seen Jack?
[4546.81 - 4572.81] Chris Nicholson: All right, folks, we're at 906.
[4573.93 - 4575.03] Chris Nicholson: We're going to get started.
[4579.43 - 4580.65] Chris Nicholson: Director Bouquet, how do you vote?
[4581.02 - 4581.54] Chris Nicholson: I mean, yes.
[4585.26 - 4591.85] Chris Nicholson: We have a quorum of me and Director Packillary and Director Nicholson and Director Harwick.
[4607.07 - 4607.41] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[4607.58 - 4609.08] Chris Nicholson: Thank you everyone for your patience.
[4609.48 - 4612.81] Chris Nicholson: We are now moving on to our next recommended action for tonight.
[4614.07 - 4626.66] Chris Nicholson: And that is going to be the recommended action of the 2025-2028 Title VI program update to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
[4627.16 - 4628.69] Chris Nicholson: Do we have a motion?
[4629.77 - 4630.29] Chris Nicholson: So moved.
[4630.85 - 4631.91] Chris Nicholson: I have Catlin as the mover.
[4632.93 - 4633.63] Chris Nicholson: Second, Guzman.
[4633.93 - 4635.49] Chris Nicholson: Guzman is the second.
[4636.96 - 4641.37] Chris Nicholson: I do understand that Director Banker has two amendments she would like to offer on this item.
[4641.75 - 4644.27] Chris Nicholson: Director Banker will take your amendments one at a time.
[4645.81 - 4647.78] Chris Nicholson: What is your first amendment, Director Banker?
[4648.34 - 4649.16] Chris Nicholson: Thank you very much.
[4649.86 - 4656.37] Chris Nicholson: And I'm glad everybody is now, you know, second wind and we're ready to go on to our
[4657.24 - 4659.41] Chris Nicholson: I don't know, six or seventh hour of meeting.
[4660.37 - 4663.76] Chris Nicholson: Actually, I will tell you I have three.
[4663.80 - 4665.04] Chris Nicholson: We'll see how things go.
[4665.08 - 4666.16] Chris Nicholson: They're short.
[4667.17 - 4669.67] Chris Nicholson: The first one, well, let me give you a little bit of background.
[4669.77 - 4670.64] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[4670.66 - 4675.71] Chris Nicholson: So the background is I met with my four cities back in February and March.
[4675.69 - 4680.19] Chris Nicholson: And of course, you meet with them and you say hi and you say, okay, what are your needs?
[4680.27 - 4681.09] Chris Nicholson: What are your wants?
[4682.15 - 4691.94] Chris Nicholson: I met with all of them and they all gave me a list of basically trying to restore service that was removed during the pandemic.
[4691.96 - 4702.53] Chris Nicholson: And so, of course, as my job as director, I'm trying to work with our staff to try to get that service restored.
[4703.37 - 4703.97] Chris Nicholson: And so,
[4705.73 - 4729.37] Chris Nicholson: One of my questions or issues is I am guessing that when the RTD Board had to make the hard decisions of how to cut service almost in half because of this highly unusual pandemic, perhaps some of these cuts were not done equally across all 15 districts.
[4729.59 - 4734.77] Chris Nicholson: Director Banker, I'm sorry to interrupt, just so that we keep in order, could we get a second on?
[4735.15 - 4736.84] Chris Nicholson: Could you read the motion and then we get a second?
[4736.86 - 4750.38] Chris Nicholson: Yes, the motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact from 10% to 20% as it relates to major service changes and consistent with the FTA circular 4702.1B.
[4752.02 - 4758.43] Chris Nicholson: And I believe the version that will be voted on is actually the version that
[4759.00 - 4760.84] Chris Nicholson: Mr. Kroll put up for us.
[4761.92 - 4764.15] Chris Nicholson: So that's, that's the language right there.
[4764.19 - 4771.52] Chris Nicholson: The first motion is to move the move to amend the 2025, 2028 title six program update, such that the threshold for triggering either.
[4771.98 - 4780.09] Chris Nicholson: Disappointed Burton or disparate in that fine late night, finding a rising from a major service change from 10% to 20%.
[4781.77 - 4782.59] Chris Nicholson: Do I have a second?
[4783.07 - 4783.43] Chris Nicholson: Second.
[4783.45 - 4785.57] Chris Nicholson: Pagliari is the second.
[4786.46 - 4786.80] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[4787.64 - 4794.12] Chris Nicholson: So just to continue a little bit more background and then we can start, I guess, the debate here.
[4795.07 - 4802.11] Chris Nicholson: I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during the pandemic.
[4802.94 - 4817.48] Chris Nicholson: And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations come out.
[4817.45 - 4832.29] Chris Nicholson: I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic and perhaps do it a little bit quicker and
[4833.60 - 4837.79] Chris Nicholson: and also try to make it not quite so difficult.
[4838.22 - 4849.54] Chris Nicholson: So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the city and county of Broomfield, and their transportation staff went through
[4849.52 - 4857.47] Chris Nicholson: our items quite closely and they sent us all a letter with recommended changes.
[4858.21 - 4868.02] Chris Nicholson: So I've gone through with their changes and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the board, see what your thoughts are.
[4868.64 - 4871.23] Chris Nicholson: You know, hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see what happens.
[4871.67 - 4877.53] Chris Nicholson: But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that
[4877.51 - 4886.84] Chris Nicholson: the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large transit agencies.
[4887.52 - 4892.99] Chris Nicholson: And so I did send you also a copy of the city and county of Broomfields letter just to refresh your memory.
[4893.99 - 4901.16] Chris Nicholson: And so I would like to put forth that the first amendment would be changing the threshold from 10% to 20%.
[4901.18 - 4902.66] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Treasurer Baker.
[4902.80 - 4905.65] Chris Nicholson: So again, the discussion right now is on the motion
[4906.32 - 4908.64] Chris Nicholson: This first motion, the first amendment.
[4908.98 - 4909.81] Chris Nicholson: Director Catlin.
[4913.41 - 4914.31] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[4914.93 - 4917.76] Chris Nicholson: I'd like to ask GM CEO Johnson.
[4918.54 - 4931.42] Chris Nicholson: I heard from someone I don't remember now because it's getting late, but someone said that some of those assumptions made by City and County Broomfield were incorrect.
[4931.48 - 4931.62] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[4931.66 - 4932.02] Chris Nicholson: Johnson.
[4932.31 - 4933.43] Chris Nicholson: Yes, thank you very much.
[4934.13 - 4952.61] Chris Nicholson: Relative to the comments that were made, and thank you very much, Director Catlin, as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned being part of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in Greater Seattle and then Chicago Transit Authority.
[4954.39 - 4959.19] Chris Nicholson: That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there,
[4959.66 - 4963.02] Chris Nicholson: This is not correct relative to where we sit.
[4963.48 - 4970.93] Chris Nicholson: And more specifically, I do know our director of civil rights when we were going through this quite naturally in the role that he is in.
[4970.99 - 4976.02] Chris Nicholson: He and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies.
[4976.04 - 4981.36] Chris Nicholson: So that's the communique that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving this information.
[4981.60 - 4986.21] Chris Nicholson: So Mr. Green, if you want to just expound succinctly and briefly.
[4986.66 - 4992.25] Chris Nicholson: Yes, thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson, to expand upon the response.
[4992.29 - 5001.74] Chris Nicholson: I just also want to ground us in first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes.
[5002.38 - 5009.53] Chris Nicholson: And in doing that audit, we looked at 22, rather 23 different organizations, which includes the four.
[5009.51 - 5013.69] Chris Nicholson: Marta, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority.
[5014.23 - 5025.43] Chris Nicholson: And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right?
[5025.63 - 5027.57] Chris Nicholson: And ours is stacked in the middle.
[5027.61 - 5029.53] Chris Nicholson: So I want to give you some numbers here.
[5030.29 - 5032.82] Chris Nicholson: So for the four that I just mentioned,
[5033.91 - 5042.60] Chris Nicholson: Marta has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%.
[5043.62 - 5054.64] Chris Nicholson: And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, six out of that 23 have 5% or less, two have 8%,
[5054.97 - 5063.93] Chris Nicholson: six, which includes us, or seven, including us, is at 10%, three at 15%, and then three at 20%.
[5064.15 - 5070.80] Chris Nicholson: And in my over eight years of doing this work, and I'll just say that
[5070.78 - 5082.88] Chris Nicholson: When you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve, specifically with Title VI.
[5083.46 - 5089.11] Chris Nicholson: Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service.
[5089.82 - 5097.15] Chris Nicholson: There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth.
[5097.67 - 5109.14] Chris Nicholson: This is just a mechanism for the agency, such as RTD and the board of directors, so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant.
[5109.16 - 5117.33] Chris Nicholson: So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.
[5119.35 - 5121.71] Chris Nicholson: I've director Ruchin next.
[5126.58 - 5131.23] Chris Nicholson: Um, I did have a question, but I also, um, treasure banker had her hand up and it was her motion.
[5131.33 - 5133.61] Chris Nicholson: So I'm happy to, to wait if that was in response.
[5134.39 - 5134.97] Chris Nicholson: Treasure banker.
[5136.34 - 5142.26] Chris Nicholson: Um, I, I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic.
[5143.23 - 5146.47] Chris Nicholson: So how can we restore
[5147.75 - 5152.40] Chris Nicholson: let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several years ago.
[5152.84 - 5160.65] Chris Nicholson: How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had that service?
[5161.54 - 5164.66] Chris Nicholson: And so now we're being told
[5164.64 - 5173.77] Chris Nicholson: that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to have it.
[5174.93 - 5182.06] Chris Nicholson: And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to pre-pandemic levels?
[5183.40 - 5183.56] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[5183.58 - 5183.96] Chris Nicholson: Johnson.
[5184.26 - 5185.89] Chris Nicholson: Yes, thank you very much, Director Banker.
[5185.93 - 5187.51] Chris Nicholson: That question is better suited for me.
[5187.55 - 5191.81] Chris Nicholson: Relative to the service delivery framework that we have,
[5192.10 - 5210.80] Chris Nicholson: While Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy service is based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours, but more specifically at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP.
[5211.44 - 5217.67] Chris Nicholson: When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were.
[5218.32 - 5220.78] Chris Nicholson: 85% of what service levels were in 2019.
[5221.55 - 5230.72] Chris Nicholson: We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward.
[5231.78 - 5236.97] Chris Nicholson: What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious
[5237.39 - 5241.80] Chris Nicholson: and how we're applying service because we do want to ensure there's equity.
[5241.84 - 5248.37] Chris Nicholson: I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well.
[5248.81 - 5259.33] Chris Nicholson: As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change.
[5259.66 - 5282.41] Chris Nicholson: That is up to the board quite naturally, but I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service keeping in mind that all transit agencies across, you know, the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power.
[5283.14 - 5288.48] Chris Nicholson: Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio.
[5288.59 - 5298.58] Chris Nicholson: What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio.
[5298.92 - 5306.25] Chris Nicholson: We've deviated from that and have a waiver and we're right sizing the fleet as we move forward.
[5306.29 - 5312.32] Chris Nicholson: So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory or were.
[5312.50 - 5313.94] Chris Nicholson: And we're coming back from that.
[5314.92 - 5327.19] Chris Nicholson: We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area from an origin and destination vantage point just by virtue of how our service area is going forward.
[5327.69 - 5331.03] Chris Nicholson: So I'm not providing this to say I don't.
[5331.01 - 5333.25] Chris Nicholson: understand what you're trying to do.
[5333.27 - 5338.96] Chris Nicholson: And as I share it with you, I do clearly and we want to work within the frameworks that we have.
[5339.60 - 5345.43] Chris Nicholson: But a whole cell of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible.
[5345.51 - 5353.58] Chris Nicholson: And I say it from the vantage point of, we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour.
[5354.03 - 5355.55] Chris Nicholson: but that was out on the street.
[5355.85 - 5359.32] Chris Nicholson: Does that really yield the return on investment going forward?
[5359.42 - 5366.97] Chris Nicholson: Hence, that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services going forward.
[5367.39 - 5368.85] Chris Nicholson: Okay, but if I can.
[5368.99 - 5370.93] Chris Nicholson: Treasure, yeah.
[5371.01 - 5375.02] Chris Nicholson: Some of the issues that you just raised are important.
[5375.19 - 5375.82] Chris Nicholson: There's no doubt.
[5376.16 - 5380.42] Chris Nicholson: However, I don't believe it goes to the equity calculation.
[5382.88 - 5383.02] Chris Nicholson: I
[5385.08 - 5400.76] Chris Nicholson: What I think is important to to hear from staff and I know we're going to be talking about this in our retreat, which is I'm looking forward to that is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in three years.
[5401.43 - 5420.99] Chris Nicholson: what barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110, and start quickly, or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher service levels.
[5422.96 - 5423.12] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[5423.16 - 5423.50] Chris Nicholson: Johnson.
[5423.78 - 5424.18] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[5424.20 - 5427.64] Chris Nicholson: There's a couple of external factors that play into that.
[5427.99 - 5434.93] Chris Nicholson: quite naturally when we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate and the lack of people commuting in.
[5435.43 - 5447.31] Chris Nicholson: It's important to keep in mind that there was, I'm forgetting the name, but the city and county of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the occupancy levels.
[5447.57 - 5451.54] Chris Nicholson: But more specifically, what's important to note is that
[5451.52 - 5456.73] Chris Nicholson: there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to this central business district.
[5457.95 - 5468.39] Chris Nicholson: I believe the last time I looked at stats, city and county at Denver was in the bottom three out of out of 50 major cities.
[5468.83 - 5472.49] Chris Nicholson: And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number
[5474.08 - 5478.92] Chris Nicholson: is the third state relative to remote work and then City of Boulder is number one.
[5479.34 - 5487.09] Chris Nicholson: While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic.
[5487.45 - 5496.88] Chris Nicholson: How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before?
[5497.56 - 5501.49] Chris Nicholson: I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward
[5501.84 - 5525.37] Chris Nicholson: relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery.
[5525.89 - 5528.96] Chris Nicholson: And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power,
[5529.26 - 5553.59] Chris Nicholson: we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available where people whereby were working extra shifts and then we didn't have enough people for daily pullout on those other routes.
[5554.01 - 5557.61] Chris Nicholson: And so I'm providing that context to say
[5557.93 - 5577.93] Chris Nicholson: to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do, but to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of this agency's.
[5580.02 - 5580.44] Chris Nicholson: Thanks, sir.
[5580.48 - 5583.86] Chris Nicholson: So I have a question for legal.
[5585.28 - 5595.48] Chris Nicholson: So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I want to be careful of my words.
[5597.30 - 5608.19] Chris Nicholson: Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public comment process or
[5608.74 - 5613.91] Chris Nicholson: Is that something that we, I guess, I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area.
[5613.99 - 5616.13] Chris Nicholson: And I wanted to get a bit of feedback on that.
[5616.59 - 5621.22] Chris Nicholson: Now, to disparage the motion, I just also want to understand the potential legal implications.
[5626.32 - 5628.69] Chris Nicholson: I will address that question.
[5629.23 - 5631.89] Chris Nicholson: And then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound.
[5631.99 - 5635.03] Chris Nicholson: I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement,
[5635.61 - 5659.39] Chris Nicholson: and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference of public perception.
[5659.85 - 5665.78] Chris Nicholson: There is leeway relative to the circular in light of what can be done.
[5665.86 - 5678.94] Chris Nicholson: We are sitting here on May 28th, recognizing that we have a new administration and that we do need to have a Title VI program that's submitted and we have been engaged on this topic since January.
[5679.41 - 5682.03] Chris Nicholson: That's not to negate any amendments or anything like that.
[5682.11 - 5684.61] Chris Nicholson: I am just trying to answer the question.
[5684.80 - 5691.97] Chris Nicholson: But more specifically, Mr. Green, since you are very well-versed in 4702.1B, I would yield the floor to you.
[5692.02 - 5696.07] Chris Nicholson: And that's the citation for the FTA circular that we're talking about.
[5696.51 - 5696.69] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[5696.75 - 5698.87] Chris Nicholson: Thank you so much, GM CEO Johnson.
[5698.93 - 5700.13] Chris Nicholson: You.
[5704.54 - 5706.94] Chris Nicholson: Apology, the positive microphone.
[5707.22 - 5707.52] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[5707.88 - 5708.32] Chris Nicholson: Apologies.
[5708.38 - 5712.31] Chris Nicholson: But to piggyback off what GM CEO Johnson has noted,
[5713.33 - 5720.37] Chris Nicholson: That is, I would couch that as the bigger risk is when we think about establishing policy, right?
[5720.43 - 5725.05] Chris Nicholson: As it relates to 4702.1B, the FTA Title VI circular.
[5725.43 - 5734.85] Chris Nicholson: it does call upon the agency to do a lot of outreach and public involvement to ensure that we are collecting that feedback to inform decisions.
[5735.41 - 5748.79] Chris Nicholson: So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as the policy.
[5749.49 - 5753.62] Chris Nicholson: So, but with respect to the circular, we can, i.e.
[5753.94 - 5757.89] Chris Nicholson: the board of directors could adopt a different threshold.
[5757.90 - 5771.00] Chris Nicholson: So for example, the one that director banker has put forth, although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update.
[5771.76 - 5779.03] Chris Nicholson: There is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the board is ultimately approving the policy.
[5780.92 - 5781.32] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[5782.18 - 5786.09] Chris Nicholson: Director Gysinger and then Director Larson.
[5789.69 - 5791.21] Chris Nicholson: Director Larson and then Harwick.
[5793.40 - 5793.82] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[5795.38 - 5810.40] Chris Nicholson: I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were for service changes, this Title VI analysis that were in the
[5810.58 - 5833.10] Chris Nicholson: the board packet, and it seemed like most of the time we, you know, sometimes there was a little bit of disparate impact on one route or the other, but mostly it sort of ended up that in the aggregate there wasn't really much, and there were legitimate justifications for what there was on an individual basis.
[5833.90 - 5838.04] Chris Nicholson: I guess my, you know, my basic question is with
[5838.39 - 5846.48] Chris Nicholson: with regard to this update and the changes that we're proposing, are we just, I mean, is there really a problem here?
[5846.50 - 5848.68] Chris Nicholson: Are we just making this harder for ourselves?
[5848.74 - 5859.87] Chris Nicholson: Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact one place or the other.
[5859.93 - 5863.72] Chris Nicholson: We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons.
[5864.68 - 5868.18] Chris Nicholson: And on balance, they don't really seem to
[5868.78 - 5881.67] Chris Nicholson: under our current setup, you know, ever, ever sort of look like they were, you know, there were somehow some, you know, bad intent or just inattention to who we're serving.
[5881.73 - 5887.84] Chris Nicholson: It seems like we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have done anyways.
[5888.21 - 5908.97] Chris Nicholson: Why put sort of a greater burden, sort of regulate ourselves more than we have to, and why not just give us the freedom to operate as we would as much as we can, given that we don't, you know, it doesn't necessarily seem like it's been a problem for a long time, at least from what I could see.
[5909.01 - 5917.40] Chris Nicholson: I mean, there weren't that many Title VI complaints that I could, that I, in the information that was provided.
[5917.87 - 5918.26] Chris Nicholson: I don't know.
[5919.44 - 5922.54] Chris Nicholson: My basic question is why would we make things harder for ourselves?
[5922.90 - 5923.14] Chris Nicholson: Thanks.
[5924.91 - 5925.79] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Ms.
[5925.83 - 5926.31] Chris Nicholson: Johnson.
[5927.78 - 5928.40] Chris Nicholson: Thank you very much.
[5928.46 - 5945.30] Chris Nicholson: The one thing I would share Director Larson, as we look at the modification that's been put forward for your consideration, like a 36 month period, as we're adding back service, there could be unforeseen consequences as we do them in a segmented fashion.
[5945.62 - 5955.19] Chris Nicholson: And so that's one element as a whole, because if we're making modifications going forward, there could be an adverse impact.
[5955.49 - 5957.91] Chris Nicholson: And so that's what I would showcase there.
[5958.69 - 5970.73] Chris Nicholson: Keeping in mind to the point that you raised, when we talk about the aspect of DIDB, it's what can we do as an agency to help mitigate that to your point going forward.
[5970.95 - 5980.30] Chris Nicholson: But it's just to ensure that we have a program whereby we are not causing undue harm to certain population segments.
[5982.76 - 5983.28] Chris Nicholson: Director Larson.
[5985.31 - 5993.22] Chris Nicholson: But it just seems like when I was reading the documents that there, we, there's always a legitimate to justification for, for everything we want to do.
[5993.23 - 6001.12] Chris Nicholson: Or we, you know, it's always, there's always this, we'll have a disparate impact, but we have a legitimate justification for, for doing this.
[6001.20 - 6002.43] Chris Nicholson: So we're, we're just going to do it.
[6002.97 - 6011.95] Chris Nicholson: I mean, how many times, how many times in the last however many years has it been that we did this analysis, we looked at all the service changes we wanted to do.
[6012.32 - 6016.77] Chris Nicholson: And we were like, okay, no, we're not going to do this list of service changes.
[6016.81 - 6023.04] Chris Nicholson: We're going to, you know, cross out these ones because the aggregate impact is too much.
[6023.64 - 6025.84] Chris Nicholson: I mean, is it, is it, is that happened?
[6026.04 - 6032.73] Chris Nicholson: I just didn't, from what I read in the packet, I didn't, I don't know if I caught everything, but it didn't seem like there were a lot of those.
[6032.99 - 6041.81] Chris Nicholson: Or is this happening kind of at an earlier stage where when Bob in service says, let's just send a bunch of buses to Cherry Hills Village, somebody says, no, no.
[6042.04 - 6046.36] Chris Nicholson: That's not going to work out before it even gets to this point.
[6047.57 - 6047.85] Chris Nicholson: You know?
[6050.27 - 6050.75] Chris Nicholson: I'm sorry.
[6051.49 - 6052.49] Chris Nicholson: Thank you for the question.
[6052.53 - 6053.61] Chris Nicholson: It's for me.
[6053.75 - 6059.18] Chris Nicholson: I've only been here for five years and I came in the height of the pandemic and we've been adding back service and not.
[6059.56 - 6069.65] Chris Nicholson: So that's difficult for me to answer just because we have not been in a situation whereby
[6070.36 - 6071.46] Chris Nicholson: It's been the opposite.
[6072.12 - 6074.40] Chris Nicholson: Carl, do you have anything to add?
[6075.00 - 6075.40] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[6075.43 - 6076.93] Chris Nicholson: I would just highlight chair bouquet.
[6076.95 - 6094.15] Chris Nicholson: If I may, since January 2023, there was about 270 service change recommendations that have been implemented and roughly 26, 24, 26 of those 276 were considered major service changes.
[6094.66 - 6101.61] Chris Nicholson: And out of that 26 to director Larson's point, there has been 13 potential disparate impacts.
[6102.45 - 6106.56] Chris Nicholson: And to your point, there was a substantial legitimate justification.
[6106.57 - 6116.63] Chris Nicholson: And going it's, I wouldn't necessarily couch it as an exercise, but I would say we were the transit equity office within within the civil rights division.
[6116.88 - 6121.41] Chris Nicholson: works hand in glove with Jesse Carter and his team service development.
[6122.18 - 6129.86] Chris Nicholson: And as we are having those conversations after the service change recommendation are put forth and we analyze it if there is a potential disparate impact.
[6130.21 - 6135.92] Chris Nicholson: More often than not, to your point, and to my earlier, earlier point, that Title VI is not a stopping mechanism.
[6136.44 - 6147.20] Chris Nicholson: And I wouldn't necessarily state that it's burdensome because it's one of our responsibilities to make sure that we are equitably distributing services across our service area.
[6147.86 - 6155.38] Chris Nicholson: But more often not, there is a legitimate justification to put forth the service recommendation as it is presented to the board.
[6158.07 - 6158.47] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[6159.58 - 6159.84] Chris Nicholson: Director.
[6162.02 - 6162.12] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[6162.14 - 6168.52] Chris Nicholson: Uh, I had director Harwick and just as a reminder, we're currently in discussion regarding this first motion.
[6168.60 - 6173.04] Chris Nicholson: Just want to make sure that, um, first amendment, excuse me, first amendment.
[6173.06 - 6176.57] Chris Nicholson: So make sure, uh, comments are around that.
[6177.03 - 6177.63] Chris Nicholson: Director Harwick.
[6179.37 - 6190.03] Chris Nicholson: Mine will be comments about this, but also moving forward as well, because I am in support of this, this title six, not, not the amendment, just as just a straight title six.
[6190.05 - 6195.74] Chris Nicholson: Um, you know, I, I don't think moving, uh, from, from 10 or from.
[6195.72 - 6201.03] Chris Nicholson: from 10% to 20% is going to increase ridership.
[6201.25 - 6211.44] Chris Nicholson: I think that right now it allows our staff the ability to really center equity and effectively protect our communities.
[6211.52 - 6218.27] Chris Nicholson: And while I get that Broomfield feels like they want more service, I don't think this is going to get it there.
[6218.91 - 6223.93] Chris Nicholson: I think this is the 11th hour and I think that it's really imperative that our staff has worked extremely hard on this.
[6223.95 - 6229.39] Chris Nicholson: They've had to jump through a whole variety of hoops.
[6230.10 - 6255.29] Chris Nicholson: bunch of different board members and I think that we're here, they've done an incredible job and I think that this is, they are the subject matter experts and it's our opportunity here to put our trust in them, our belief in them and I think that we owe them that and we have been talking about this since January so we're well into four months and I think that it is key that we support this
[6255.27 - 6264.21] Chris Nicholson: Title six as is and we allow them to move forward and we allow them to start you know handing us off to the feds and we can move forward and That's where I'm at.
[6264.33 - 6264.61] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[6264.97 - 6274.95] Chris Nicholson: Thank you director any further conversation on this amendment Secretary Nicholson So this is for our deputy general counsel
[6275.39 - 6287.54] Chris Nicholson: If we were to pass this tonight, what's the legal risk to the agency when it comes to our federal Title VI approval as a result of this change?
[6287.70 - 6300.10] Chris Nicholson: Like, is this gonna have any, would this have any legal repercussions or could we just, do we feel pretty comfortable that we could do this and not have the federal government take issue with it?
[6301.48 - 6303.39] Chris Nicholson: In regards to the amendment secretary?
[6303.40 - 6303.51] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[6306.91 - 6307.49] Chris Nicholson: deputy counsel.
[6311.41 - 6311.76] Chris Nicholson: There we go.
[6311.77 - 6312.26] Chris Nicholson: Excuse me.
[6312.82 - 6314.18] Chris Nicholson: Uh, thank you, director Nicholson.
[6314.74 - 6316.02] Chris Nicholson: Um, I, I don't have concerns.
[6318.92 - 6319.32] Chris Nicholson: Secretary.
[6321.16 - 6321.73] Chris Nicholson: That is all.
[6322.81 - 6323.91] Chris Nicholson: Uh, yeah, treasure banker.
[6325.39 - 6333.36] Chris Nicholson: Um, here is where I do not understand in 2019.
[6335.72 - 6337.20] Chris Nicholson: We had the service.
[6338.51 - 6342.90] Chris Nicholson: My area, my district as many others have grown.
[6342.96 - 6346.01] Chris Nicholson: There's no
[6347.21 - 6355.28] Chris Nicholson: For example, the town of Erie, just a few years ago was 20,000, now it's 40,000, like two, three years later.
[6355.30 - 6363.35] Chris Nicholson: And when I met with Erie, they said, hey, we're planning going to 80,000 in just the next couple of years.
[6364.09 - 6374.72] Chris Nicholson: I also read in the Denver Post that the town of Erie is the 15th fastest city in the country in terms of population growth.
[6375.73 - 6391.32] Chris Nicholson: So my question is, is if we had the service prior to the pandemic and it was serving all of these communities, why is it so difficult to get that restored?
[6395.47 - 6396.09] Chris Nicholson: Just Johnson.
[6399.77 - 6402.39] Chris Nicholson: So thank you, Director Banker.
[6404.67 - 6424.81] Chris Nicholson: This, what I'm going to say goes back to the previous comments that I had before, recognizing that RTD is a regional service and the way the service was outlined for all intents and purposes was bringing individuals into the central business district.
[6427.27 - 6432.94] Chris Nicholson: That level of ridership isn't there and that's not to negate that there
[6433.84 - 6439.26] Chris Nicholson: is some elements centered on a need to move people to and fro.
[6439.32 - 6443.05] Chris Nicholson: Hence, that's why there was the advent of the partnership program.
[6443.39 - 6450.49] Chris Nicholson: And one of the reasons why Erie basically wanted to join the district because they were looking to put forward an application
[6450.84 - 6476.02] Chris Nicholson: for the partnership program, and I know you're just using that as an example, but just wanted to further iterate that because for all intents and purposes, as we're looking to provide mobility options, the intent behind the partnership program was more or less like a pilot in the sense that let's see how many people are utilizing this means of connection
[6476.66 - 6488.65] Chris Nicholson: prior to putting out a 40 foot or a 60 foot Arctic that costs more money per revenue hour and doesn't yield the same return on investment relative to the cost per boarding.
[6490.25 - 6493.04] Chris Nicholson: Does that help or did I complicated more?
[6493.08 - 6496.66] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[6496.68 - 6497.08] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[6497.22 - 6499.10] Chris Nicholson: Director Guzman and then Director Geisinger.
[6499.85 - 6503.79] Chris Nicholson: So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight.
[6504.19 - 6506.49] Chris Nicholson: I'm getting back to the motion before us.
[6507.00 - 6519.31] Chris Nicholson: I would like to ask one question, which is the 10 to 20% is still not going to prevent us from adding services.
[6520.29 - 6535.23] Chris Nicholson: It is simply a filter through which to look, if I understand this correctly, that we are not unintentionally harming community with protected status under the Title VI legislation,
[6535.63 - 6542.84] Chris Nicholson: or those that might be disproportionately burdened or impacted by their financial and economic status within the region.
[6543.96 - 6556.22] Chris Nicholson: The only purpose we need to pass this is because it is due, because it is the law, and it is how we ensure that we are able to receive our federal funding, which is approximately 25% of our total budget.
[6557.40 - 6560.76] Chris Nicholson: So I just want to make sure I understand.
[6560.98 - 6565.83] Chris Nicholson: what has been presented here does not tell the board no, we cannot provide transit service.
[6566.61 - 6586.19] Chris Nicholson: It is simply a way to look at it and say we may have an issue if it reaches a certain threshold that we need to be aware of in order to be able to approve changes in service, fair changes or other changes that would create a potential burden on specific
[6587.14 - 6590.50] Chris Nicholson: communities as defined within the Title VI language.
[6590.70 - 6595.03] Chris Nicholson: Is that correct or am I completely lost in this conversation?
[6596.85 - 6597.59] Chris Nicholson: Chair, are we okay for me?
[6597.97 - 6599.03] Chris Nicholson: Absolutely, Mr. Green.
[6599.05 - 6603.14] Chris Nicholson: If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear.
[6603.20 - 6605.88] Chris Nicholson: And if you have any double back, then I'll respond to it.
[6606.50 - 6612.05] Chris Nicholson: So the current 10%, so if we think about different thresholds for DIDB,
[6612.77 - 6641.98] Chris Nicholson: And we are in, based off the desk audit, we're in the middle tier of having a threshold that allows us as an agency, which ultimately each service equity analysis is approved by the board of directors, where it allows us, again, to your point, when we're thinking about BIPOC or Black Indigenous people of color, for disparate impact or loan communities, for disproportionate burden, it allows us to make a well-informed, eyes-wide open decision
[6642.40 - 6646.95] Chris Nicholson: of better understanding of who's more likely to receive more of the impact.
[6647.47 - 6656.02] Chris Nicholson: And when we're thinking about service increases, we're thinking about the fair share of benefits, where if there is a service reduction, we're looking at who's more likely to receive more of the burden.
[6656.54 - 6666.17] Chris Nicholson: So to your point, Director Guzman, it allows us to just get a better understanding of the level of impact that we can have on a particular community.
[6666.59 - 6669.24] Chris Nicholson: It does not prevent us from moving forward.
[6671.19 - 6671.61] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[6671.63 - 6678.95] Chris Nicholson: I would just urge a no vote and let's move on to the policy.
[6679.86 - 6680.32] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[6681.14 - 6685.99] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Geisinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this specific amendment.
[6686.23 - 6687.39] Chris Nicholson: I'll be super quick.
[6687.41 - 6693.64] Chris Nicholson: At that last explanation that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of just giving us a better holistic view.
[6693.66 - 6701.49] Chris Nicholson: But I shared Director Larson's sort of view of are we just making this harder for ourselves, creating more work?
[6703.23 - 6704.05] Chris Nicholson: Is that not right?
[6705.59 - 6706.53] Chris Nicholson: Mr. Green?
[6706.55 - 6708.28] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, that's a great follow up question.
[6708.30 - 6709.62] Chris Nicholson: I would say it
[6710.85 - 6738.71] Chris Nicholson: I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when we think about what we're ultimately trying to achieve and a percentage that's mathematically consistent relative to the populations that we serve, so in doing this work, given my background, right, in doing an assessment of whether if we, and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is
[6738.98 - 6750.13] Chris Nicholson: with doing this work, or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyses, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything.
[6751.39 - 6762.07] Chris Nicholson: And that's a disservice when we think about our populations within our service area, specifically as we look at our census data where 38.1% is BIPOC, 13.1%.
[6762.65 - 6765.60] Chris Nicholson: or 14.1 rather for low income, right?
[6765.72 - 6769.96] Chris Nicholson: And then if we look at the onboard survey, 56% are considered BIPOC.
[6770.98 - 6791.80] Chris Nicholson: And so I say all that to say, just to wrap it up, is that 10% threshold for DINDB allows us to make an informed decision that is backed by not only our desk audit, but the years of experience and knowing, having a better understanding of ultimately what we're trying to achieve.
[6794.35 - 6794.77] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[6795.09 - 6795.41] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[6795.93 - 6797.63] Chris Nicholson: All right, let's do a roll call vote.
[6797.65 - 6807.76] Chris Nicholson: As a reminder, it is the First Amendment being introduced, as you all can see on that screen, with Director Banker as the mover and Director Pagulieri as the second.
[6807.86 - 6810.54] Chris Nicholson: Again, we're voting on this First Amendment.
[6811.34 - 6811.92] Chris Nicholson: Treasure Banker.
[6812.78 - 6813.00] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[6813.82 - 6814.93] Chris Nicholson: Director Buzik is gone.
[6814.97 - 6816.39] Chris Nicholson: Director Katlin.
[6818.01 - 6819.03] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6819.05 - 6820.27] Chris Nicholson: Director Geisinger.
[6822.87 - 6822.93] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6824.35 - 6824.73] Chris Nicholson: Director.
[6824.85 - 6825.17] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6825.19 - 6825.33] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6826.05 - 6827.09] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6827.11 - 6827.33] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6827.41 - 6827.75] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6828.17 - 6828.94] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6828.95 - 6829.14] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6829.66 - 6829.86] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6830.64 - 6830.84] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6831.14 - 6831.26] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6832.00 - 6832.22] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6833.32 - 6833.56] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6833.62 - 6837.63] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6841.07 - 6842.92] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6844.46 - 6847.30] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6848.34 - 6850.51] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6850.71 - 6850.85] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6851.39 - 6851.69] Chris Nicholson: No.
[6854.05 - 6855.47] Chris Nicholson: I mean, yes, but the motion will fail.
[6856.95 - 6860.10] Chris Nicholson: And we have three to 10.
[6861.34 - 6862.97] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[6862.98 - 6863.47] Chris Nicholson: Moving on.
[6863.73 - 6864.31] Chris Nicholson: Yes, Director.
[6864.35 - 6866.49] Chris Nicholson: I would like to withdraw the next two amendments.
[6866.91 - 6867.61] Chris Nicholson: Next two amendments.
[6867.75 - 6867.95] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[6868.64 - 6869.62] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[6869.64 - 6872.14] Chris Nicholson: The next two amendments have been withdrawn.
[6873.52 - 6875.07] Chris Nicholson: Okay, they were never introduced.
[6875.11 - 6881.83] Chris Nicholson: So they're not really with John, but now you would return back to the debate on the main motion, which is to approve the title six program update.
[6882.25 - 6882.63] Chris Nicholson: Excellent.
[6883.17 - 6884.42] Chris Nicholson: Back to the main motion at hand.
[6885.00 - 6885.64] Chris Nicholson: Director Keith.
[6887.17 - 6894.42] Chris Nicholson: So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on this action.
[6894.48 - 6897.21] Chris Nicholson: There's a few things going on.
[6897.25 - 6900.41] Chris Nicholson: First of all, it should never get to the last minute.
[6900.93 - 6906.10] Chris Nicholson: The board should never be asked to pass things because it's due in two days.
[6906.42 - 6912.61] Chris Nicholson: And I know there's a lot of things that go into the delay, but that's just not the right
[6913.08 - 6919.51] Chris Nicholson: That's not the right urgency to place on the board act.
[6919.81 - 6926.88] Chris Nicholson: Secondly, I don't know very much about this topic and I have sat in on two operations committee meetings.
[6928.33 - 6929.55] Chris Nicholson: I've talked to a bunch of people.
[6929.61 - 6932.34] Chris Nicholson: I've done my own research.
[6932.31 - 6937.60] Chris Nicholson: And I still am looking for a succinct description of the program.
[6937.64 - 6943.23] Chris Nicholson: I would note that there was a wonderful book written by Robert Carrow.
[6943.25 - 6944.37] Chris Nicholson: It's called The Power Broker.
[6944.61 - 6946.85] Chris Nicholson: I'm sure a lot of people in this room know it.
[6947.60 - 6954.20] Chris Nicholson: Talks a lot about bad policy decisions on disadvantaged communities.
[6954.19 - 6962.32] Chris Nicholson: and how those decisions were made and the harmful outcome of those decisions.
[6963.77 - 6968.28] Chris Nicholson: It is 15 pages shorter than our packet tonight.
[6968.73 - 6978.29] Chris Nicholson: He won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1200 page treatise on impact by public infrastructure.
[6978.31 - 6985.42] Chris Nicholson: I would request that when we're passing along documents as part of a packet,
[6985.40 - 6990.09] Chris Nicholson: it needs to have a point and it should be summarized from the committee for the rest of the board.
[6990.15 - 6995.37] Chris Nicholson: Simply passing things along for us does not help me understand this better.
[6995.39 - 7002.58] Chris Nicholson: I'm probably a yes vote tonight, but I was a no vote until about an hour and a half ago.
[7002.64 - 7012.17] Chris Nicholson: And so I just, when you are putting together packets on complex questions for the board,
[7012.15 - 7016.38] Chris Nicholson: Given us reams of paper does not help us get to a better decision.
[7017.10 - 7029.86] Chris Nicholson: So that's something request for the two three ish committee chairs As you're putting together topics like this and that would be very helpful for me to make better Decisions.
[7030.44 - 7030.70] Chris Nicholson: Thanks.
[7031.02 - 7031.72] Chris Nicholson: Thank you director.
[7031.84 - 7034.70] Chris Nicholson: Okay any further comments or questions on the main motion?
[7035.77 - 7040.89] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Guzman, I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously
[7041.50 - 7047.16] Chris Nicholson: submitted a proclamation for RTD on May 19th, 2025.
[7047.26 - 7048.85] Chris Nicholson: It is in the director's emails.
[7049.51 - 7066.09] Chris Nicholson: It was sent over by city council that they wholeheartedly support the 2025, 2028 title six program to include the proposed updates to major service change, disparate impact and fair equity policies, as well as updates to RTD's public participation plan and language access plan, which we are voting on now.
[7066.81 - 7071.07] Chris Nicholson: and that the clerk and recorder of the city and county of Denver did affix the seal making it official.
[7072.27 - 7074.02] Chris Nicholson: I believe that that is necessary.
[7074.04 - 7092.68] Chris Nicholson: There's a whole proclamation, you can read through it, but former board director Lewis, sorry, we had two Lewises and I wanted to make sure I said it right, did work with city council member Serena Gutierrez Gonzalez and
[7093.28 - 7097.53] Chris Nicholson: The unanimity of that vote is remarkable from our city council.
[7097.63 - 7101.08] Chris Nicholson: So they stand behind this as well with us to move this forward.
[7101.10 - 7102.06] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7102.08 - 7102.90] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, director.
[7103.69 - 7104.39] Chris Nicholson: Director Larson.
[7106.31 - 7107.37] Chris Nicholson: I'm going to be a no vote.
[7107.81 - 7109.22] Chris Nicholson: I think.
[7109.74 - 7113.86] Chris Nicholson: I think it's kind of like I said, we're constraining our freedom to operate.
[7113.92 - 7116.93] Chris Nicholson: We're spending a lot of energy and effort to track this.
[7117.31 - 7131.01] Chris Nicholson: And I know the intentions behind that are good, but I think just as a matter of principle, we shouldn't be sort of trying to over, or regulating ourselves more.
[7131.43 - 7134.63] Chris Nicholson: We should be thinking is, we have not,
[7134.61 - 7147.17] Chris Nicholson: There's not really a lot of evidence that we have disparately ever had any recent plans to expand service or decrease service in a way that
[7147.62 - 7152.35] Chris Nicholson: that causes a disparate impact on these populations.
[7152.77 - 7171.13] Chris Nicholson: And I honestly believe that if we focused 100% just on increasing ridership, which is what I think we should be doing, and not trying to expand our sort of purview about when, you know, when maybe we shouldn't increase ridership, I don't know if we really, if it's legitimate, we'll do it anyways.
[7171.47 - 7186.63] Chris Nicholson: I really think if we were focusing strictly on increasing ridership, we would actually, it would all be disparately impacted in favor of all the communities we're worried about just based on the way population is distributed in the area.
[7187.11 - 7196.53] Chris Nicholson: And I would like for us to kind of move towards a paradigm of focusing much, much more on increasing ridership across the board.
[7196.97 - 7202.02] Chris Nicholson: and less on finding possible reasons to not increase ridership.
[7203.16 - 7204.15] Chris Nicholson: So I'll be in no vote.
[7204.17 - 7205.09] Chris Nicholson: Thanks.
[7205.11 - 7205.95] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Director Larson.
[7206.03 - 7206.87] Chris Nicholson: Secretary Nicholson.
[7208.49 - 7217.10] Chris Nicholson: So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session and a town hall all on this topic.
[7217.48 - 7228.37] Chris Nicholson: And I should say, expertly facilitated by our co-chairs and by our chair of finance and our staff.
[7228.65 - 7234.29] Chris Nicholson: And I feel like I just starting to get a decent understanding of it.
[7234.49 - 7238.50] Chris Nicholson: Like I came into this knowing nothing about this.
[7238.48 - 7258.46] Chris Nicholson: I was an absolute no when we first started and my public remarks, you know, made that very clear but I want to commend staff and our board leadership who were willing to indulge because I came to understand it.
[7258.86 - 7270.86] Chris Nicholson: I came to understand what it was for, I came to understand how it works, and I don't necessarily agree with all of it, and I think we could use more data in addition to those data we have now to determine this, but...
[7271.99 - 7273.99] Chris Nicholson: If we don't pass this, we lose federal funding.
[7274.32 - 7276.48] Chris Nicholson: So there's a good reason to pass it even if you don't like it.
[7278.02 - 7282.79] Chris Nicholson: But on top of that, I just think our staff did their jobs.
[7283.29 - 7288.30] Chris Nicholson: They have demonstrated to me this is the right thing to do despite my skepticism.
[7288.52 - 7290.34] Chris Nicholson: And so I'm definitely voting for it tonight.
[7290.98 - 7291.72] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7291.74 - 7293.10] Chris Nicholson: Any further comments on the main motion?
[7294.50 - 7295.20] Chris Nicholson: Okay, seeing none.
[7295.23 - 7298.01] Chris Nicholson: We had Catlin as the mover and Guzman as the second.
[7298.53 - 7300.50] Chris Nicholson: There is indication that there will be no votes.
[7300.56 - 7302.72] Chris Nicholson: So I will be doing a roll call vote on this.
[7304.09 - 7304.85] Chris Nicholson: Uh, treasurer banker.
[7304.87 - 7306.15] Chris Nicholson: Uh, no.
[7308.03 - 7308.69] Chris Nicholson: Director Catlin.
[7309.60 - 7309.82] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7312.24 - 7313.09] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Geisinger.
[7313.56 - 7313.84] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7314.94 - 7315.72] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Gutierrez.
[7316.12 - 7316.44] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7316.96 - 7317.62] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Guzman.
[7317.82 - 7318.06] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7318.36 - 7319.00] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Harwick.
[7319.42 - 7319.84] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7321.17 - 7321.85] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Larson.
[7322.43 - 7322.65] Chris Nicholson: No.
[7323.25 - 7324.05] Chris Nicholson: Secretary Nicholson.
[7324.71 - 7324.99] Chris Nicholson: I'm in.
[7326.29 - 7327.15] Chris Nicholson: First Vice Chair O'Keeffe.
[7328.02 - 7328.26] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7328.66 - 7329.44] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Pagulari.
[7331.04 - 7331.32] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7331.96 - 7332.60] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Ruscha.
[7332.92 - 7334.67] Chris Nicholson: Yep.
[7334.75 - 7335.75] Chris Nicholson: Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
[7335.98 - 7336.28] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7337.04 - 7337.90] Chris Nicholson: I'm also, yes.
[7338.35 - 7344.45] Chris Nicholson: So the motion, the main motion will pass 11, two and two absent.
[7345.90 - 7346.10] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7346.42 - 7348.26] Chris Nicholson: That math adds up.
[7348.28 - 7348.56] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[7349.08 - 7359.77] Chris Nicholson: Moving on, we're going to be moving to our next recommended action, which is the budget transfer articulated buses supporting Colfax bus rapid transit or BRT service.
[7359.87 - 7360.77] Chris Nicholson: Do I have a mover?
[7361.74 - 7362.14] Chris Nicholson: So moved.
[7362.18 - 7362.60] Chris Nicholson: Guzman.
[7362.64 - 7363.73] Chris Nicholson: I have Guzman as the mover.
[7363.75 - 7364.45] Chris Nicholson: Do I have a second?
[7364.57 - 7364.85] Chris Nicholson: Second.
[7366.55 - 7366.71] Chris Nicholson: Sir.
[7367.07 - 7367.79] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[7367.81 - 7368.07] Chris Nicholson: Oh, wait.
[7368.47 - 7369.11] Chris Nicholson: Well, I could be wrong.
[7369.13 - 7369.45] Chris Nicholson: I'm sorry.
[7370.26 - 7371.24] Chris Nicholson: I forgot we started late.
[7371.50 - 7372.56] Chris Nicholson: I thought we had our four hour mark.
[7373.04 - 7373.56] Chris Nicholson: Please ignore me.
[7376.55 - 7377.09] Chris Nicholson: Oh, sorry.
[7377.11 - 7378.87] Chris Nicholson: Guzman is the mover.
[7378.93 - 7380.13] Chris Nicholson: Whitmore is the second.
[7383.86 - 7384.90] Chris Nicholson: Any discussion on it?
[7385.88 - 7386.86] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, director Pagular.
[7387.23 - 7391.82] Chris Nicholson: I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting for this.
[7391.86 - 7404.44] Chris Nicholson: I was not necessarily sure how this would further the clean energy and zero emission goals of the state of Colorado.
[7404.46 - 7409.02] Chris Nicholson: And therefore, we'll just be voting now.
[7409.09 - 7409.43] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7411.95 - 7413.43] Chris Nicholson: Any further conversation?
[7413.47 - 7414.45] Chris Nicholson: Secretary Nicholson?
[7415.77 - 7419.86] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, so I understand where we're the importance of what we're doing here.
[7421.46 - 7430.84] Chris Nicholson: I think that these buses in particular, you know, in my religion, there's a thing why is this night different from all other nights why are these buses different from all other buses.
[7432.07 - 7436.23] Chris Nicholson: These are going to be the flagship of our flagship BRT line.
[7437.09 - 7443.74] Chris Nicholson: And if these suck, it will kill BRT.
[7444.28 - 7458.56] Chris Nicholson: And if they are not comfortable, if they are not just awesome in every way possible, you can make a lot of choices when you buy a bus about how nice it's going to be in the same way you can make a lot of choices about when you buy a car about how nice it's going to be.
[7459.22 - 7462.06] Chris Nicholson: And so I just want to lean in here
[7462.04 - 7484.94] Chris Nicholson: and I do have one question, to say that we need to pull the stops out, we need to make sure we're giving you enough money, GMCO Johnson, to make sure we're buying top of the line, to make sure that these are things that when they run through my district, people go, wow, I want to get on that, not, wow, that doesn't look very nice.
[7485.66 - 7492.05] Chris Nicholson: And so my question for you is, how do you know that the amount of money that we're authorizing today
[7492.02 - 7494.13] Chris Nicholson: is enough to get top of the line.
[7494.91 - 7505.36] Chris Nicholson: And how many bytes at the Apple are we going to get to make sure that you are buying the right buses for this incredibly important project?
[7506.56 - 7506.75] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[7506.81 - 7509.49] Chris Nicholson: Johnson is 51 million enough to make them not suck.
[7510.67 - 7511.23] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[7512.31 - 7515.09] Chris Nicholson: So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
[7515.73 - 7517.73] Chris Nicholson: And thank you for the question.
[7518.43 - 7519.59] Chris Nicholson: My apologies.
[7519.63 - 7520.35] Chris Nicholson: That was a good question.
[7520.57 - 7521.34] Chris Nicholson: Keep it in mind.
[7521.36 - 7525.66] Chris Nicholson: This is a budget transfer and full transparency.
[7526.18 - 7530.72] Chris Nicholson: Director Nicholson emailed me about this because I think there was some confusion about where we are.
[7531.05 - 7532.63] Chris Nicholson: There is yet to be a solicitation.
[7532.67 - 7534.49] Chris Nicholson: There's yet to be specifications.
[7534.89 - 7541.67] Chris Nicholson: So these monies that are being transferred or needed
[7542.08 - 7544.40] Chris Nicholson: for all intents and purposes so we can start a procurement.
[7546.84 - 7549.85] Chris Nicholson: Now, keeping in mind, there's a couple of elements.
[7550.19 - 7558.35] Chris Nicholson: These buses have to be dedicated because this is designated as a bus rapid transit project as defined by the Federal Transit Administration.
[7558.81 - 7564.40] Chris Nicholson: There's certain criteria that we have to ensure that we adhere to.
[7564.46 - 7571.61] Chris Nicholson: This will be a dedicated fleet just by virtue of the configuration of BRT with it being a center running platform.
[7572.10 - 7583.03] Chris Nicholson: So when you talk about it being top of the line, that's yet to be seen in reference to what we have before us because there's only two original equipment manufacturers in the United States.
[7583.09 - 7584.64] Chris Nicholson: There's only so many suppliers.
[7585.00 - 7593.55] Chris Nicholson: There are certain seeds and there is a national task force in which I sit where we're talking about doing away with customization because that increases prices.
[7593.80 - 7597.84] Chris Nicholson: I bet you don't know how many shades of white there is with new flier industries.
[7598.14 - 7598.32] Chris Nicholson: 24.
[7598.62 - 7599.68] Chris Nicholson: How many?
[7599.70 - 7600.28] Chris Nicholson: 24.
[7600.31 - 7601.19] Chris Nicholson: 23.
[7601.45 - 7602.93] Chris Nicholson: I think I told you that earlier.
[7603.01 - 7613.12] Chris Nicholson: So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this, right, we're going to do our due diligence and we're going to ensure it's a competitive solicitation.
[7613.16 - 7620.53] Chris Nicholson: And we do understand the aspects because that's what separates bus rapid transit from general thick route service.
[7621.43 - 7621.85] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7622.48 - 7624.93] Chris Nicholson: Secretary, I really appreciate it.
[7625.01 - 7629.69] Chris Nicholson: And I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how the purchase is going.
[7632.10 - 7632.60] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7632.62 - 7643.59] Chris Nicholson: Uh, director Griswold, just really quickly, uh, with regards to this, moving this money from the unrestricted fund is simply to begin the procurement process.
[7644.11 - 7647.90] Chris Nicholson: And although it's not part of the 2025 budget, we do need to get started on it.
[7648.50 - 7649.20] Chris Nicholson: Um, however,
[7649.45 - 7656.60] Chris Nicholson: I would suggest that as we go forward, these buses are meant to be purchased in finality by 2027 to begin this service.
[7657.24 - 7668.75] Chris Nicholson: And that is work that we will do to fully do on finance and planning to ensure that it is included in all necessary documents that come before this board for approval.
[7669.23 - 7672.46] Chris Nicholson: And I am certain that our new CFO is up to the task on that.
[7672.58 - 7678.89] Chris Nicholson: So rest assured, directors, we're not wantonly spending money, but we do need to authorize
[7679.42 - 7701.99] Chris Nicholson: this for the procurement of the buses at this point thank you thank you director any further discussion on this item all right there is a note oh no sounds good all right i was it was indicated there will be a no vote so i'll do a roll call vote again this is the budget transfer articulate articulated buses supporting coal fax vrt service uh treasure banker
[7702.47 - 7703.41] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7703.44 - 7704.12] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Catlin.
[7704.40 - 7704.62] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7705.50 - 7706.22] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Geisinger.
[7706.42 - 7706.66] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7707.14 - 7707.90] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Guciniter.
[7708.26 - 7708.56] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7709.00 - 7709.60] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Guzman.
[7710.09 - 7710.32] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7710.55 - 7711.17] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Harwick.
[7711.23 - 7711.53] Chris Nicholson: Yep.
[7711.85 - 7712.53] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Larsen.
[7712.69 - 7712.99] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7713.11 - 7713.85] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Nicholson.
[7714.39 - 7715.59] Chris Nicholson: Nicholson Gauper.
[7717.36 - 7717.58] Chris Nicholson: What?
[7718.08 - 7718.50] Chris Nicholson: Sorry.
[7718.52 - 7719.66] Chris Nicholson: That was a bad internet wreck.
[7719.68 - 7719.94] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7721.14 - 7721.96] Chris Nicholson: Nicholson is a yes.
[7722.04 - 7722.94] Chris Nicholson: Director O'Keefe.
[7725.35 - 7726.76] Chris Nicholson: Director Roqueeth is a yes.
[7727.22 - 7728.08] Chris Nicholson: Director Pagulari.
[7728.24 - 7728.48] Chris Nicholson: No.
[7728.96 - 7730.04] Chris Nicholson: Director Pagulari is a no.
[7730.10 - 7730.78] Chris Nicholson: Director Arusha.
[7731.00 - 7731.92] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7731.94 - 7732.58] Chris Nicholson: Director Whitmore.
[7733.66 - 7733.88] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7734.52 - 7735.74] Chris Nicholson: OK.
[7735.77 - 7738.77] Chris Nicholson: So that passes 12, 1, and 2.
[7739.67 - 7739.97] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[7740.01 - 7740.67] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, folks.
[7740.71 - 7741.75] Chris Nicholson: So we have one.
[7742.17 - 7743.47] Chris Nicholson: Chair Buke, could you remind us?
[7743.77 - 7748.58] Chris Nicholson: Over here, we missed who the mover and the seconder were on that.
[7748.96 - 7749.94] Chris Nicholson: I had Guzman and Whitmore.
[7750.28 - 7750.46] Chris Nicholson: OK.
[7750.54 - 7750.84] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7751.54 - 7751.92] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7752.74 - 7753.62] Chris Nicholson: Um, okay.
[7753.64 - 7753.98] Chris Nicholson: Excellent.
[7754.27 - 7755.79] Chris Nicholson: Uh, thank you all again for your patience.
[7755.81 - 7761.73] Chris Nicholson: We do have one more item and that is the equitable transit oriented development policy amendment.
[7763.10 - 7778.19] Chris Nicholson: So for the board of directors to approve the amendment to resolution number two series of 2021, which created the equal transit oriented development policy that permits and encourages the development of affordable housing on RTD real property in order to include guidelines for disposing
[7778.46 - 7782.53] Chris Nicholson: of RTD real property, below fair market value or rent.
[7782.89 - 7783.55] Chris Nicholson: Do we have a motion?
[7783.75 - 7784.49] Chris Nicholson: So moved, Guzman.
[7784.69 - 7785.47] Chris Nicholson: Guzman's the mover.
[7785.49 - 7786.09] Chris Nicholson: Do we have a second?
[7786.61 - 7787.76] Chris Nicholson: I have Harwick as a second.
[7789.70 - 7794.98] Chris Nicholson: I do understand that on this item, we have some proposed amendments from Director Nicholson and Director Ruscha.
[7795.93 - 7799.77] Chris Nicholson: Since Director Nicholson's amendment was circulated to the board first, we will start there.
[7800.39 - 7803.24] Chris Nicholson: Director Nicholson, please now make your motion to amend.
[7803.82 - 7817.99] Chris Nicholson: Yes, I'd like to move to amend the etod policy and I'm hoping that GMC GMC that Mr. Crawl can put up those that language on the screen.
[7818.95 - 7819.40] Chris Nicholson: It's there.
[7820.04 - 7820.22] Chris Nicholson: Right.
[7821.92 - 7822.22] Chris Nicholson: May I.
[7823.62 - 7826.36] Chris Nicholson: Uh, would you like to read the motion and then we'll get a second.
[7826.52 - 7826.88] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7826.92 - 7827.44] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[7827.47 - 7841.59] Chris Nicholson: So, uh, move to amend the policy, uh, such that section five of the equitable transit oriented development policy regarding negotiated land price be updated as follows to raise the maximum negotiated land price discount to 75% from 50%.
[7841.57 - 7859.97] Chris Nicholson: and add the following additional factors to favorably consider projects which include more accessible units than required by law, limit residential parking, are deeply affordable, emphasize priority groups as identified by the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority,
[7860.09 - 7870.43] Chris Nicholson: and incorporate smaller footprint retail, including below market rate units, below market rate retail, excuse me, that prioritizes local businesses and entrepreneurs.
[7873.24 - 7875.46] Chris Nicholson: Excellent.
[7875.48 - 7876.40] Chris Nicholson: And do we have a second on that?
[7876.98 - 7877.61] Chris Nicholson: Second.
[7877.63 - 7878.45] Chris Nicholson: Hardwick is the second.
[7880.52 - 7882.16] Chris Nicholson: Secretary, would you like to discuss further?
[7882.43 - 7882.79] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7882.81 - 7883.03] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[7883.37 - 7895.69] Chris Nicholson: Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll to briefly describe the five pieces of written public comment that we received on this recommended action from some of our local public officials.
[7896.23 - 7904.39] Chris Nicholson: Yes, so four of the written public common items were submitted by individuals specifically supportive of the change director Nicholson is offering.
[7904.41 - 7914.06] Chris Nicholson: And those four individuals were the mayor of Boulder, a city council member from Boulder, a city council member from Westminster and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.
[7914.03 - 7928.10] Chris Nicholson: And then the fifth letter was submitted by SWEAP in joint with Conservation Colorado and Denver Streets Partnership, which spoke more broadly to the overall changes being offered this evening.
[7930.94 - 7931.56] Chris Nicholson: Perfect, Secretary.
[7932.05 - 7933.35] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[7933.37 - 7935.89] Chris Nicholson: And thank you, Executive Manager Crawl.
[7936.63 - 7939.39] Chris Nicholson: So here at RTD, we make lives better through connections.
[7939.76 - 7943.38] Chris Nicholson: Tonight as a board, we have an opportunity to do that in a particularly powerful way.
[7944.24 - 7946.12] Chris Nicholson: Our rider surveys tell a clear story.
[7946.67 - 7953.28] Chris Nicholson: Over half our passengers live below 200% of the federal poverty level, and they are far less likely to own a car.
[7954.02 - 7960.85] Chris Nicholson: Our riders with disabilities use RTD at disproportionately high rates, as do other vulnerable populations in our community.
[7960.83 - 7967.74] Chris Nicholson: Yet only a fraction of affordable housing developed near our stations truly meets the needs of our most dedicated riders.
[7968.42 - 7972.40] Chris Nicholson: Communities in our state have struggled to create housing targeted at our ridership.
[7972.78 - 7979.13] Chris Nicholson: Inclusionary zoning has mostly led to housing at 60% AMI, about $51,000 a year in earnings.
[7979.69 - 7988.41] Chris Nicholson: This housing is necessary but priced well out of reach for someone making only $31,000, which is 200% of the federal poverty line.
[7988.39 - 7997.77] Chris Nicholson: This amendment empowers RTD to deepen our land discount offerings, up to 75%, to incentivize projects specifically tailored to the actual economic realities of our riders.
[7998.43 - 8000.15] Chris Nicholson: Here's how that can work in practice.
[8000.17 - 8007.41] Chris Nicholson: Just this month, Denver Health donated the land to create Tapestry, a deeply affordable, accessible, transit-oriented housing project.
[8007.77 - 8016.79] Chris Nicholson: It supports a range of affordability from 30% to 80%, as well as far more three-bedroom and even four-bedroom units than most affordable projects being built today.
[8017.59 - 8024.84] Chris Nicholson: It targets accessibility because distance to transit is a major barrier for people with disabilities to use transit.
[8024.86 - 8032.21] Chris Nicholson: This holds for all types of disabilities and unfortunately, painfully few Class A fully accessible units exist
[8032.19 - 8033.72] Chris Nicholson: in the RTD service area.
[8034.26 - 8038.58] Chris Nicholson: By creating greater incentives for developers, we can do a lot to play our part in fixing that.
[8039.34 - 8045.77] Chris Nicholson: It's late, so I won't go through the argument for reduced parking and the service of CHFA's priority populations.
[8046.05 - 8047.65] Chris Nicholson: You all have an email from me with that data.
[8048.17 - 8054.62] Chris Nicholson: But I do want Director Harwick to speak after me to address the language he added on smaller footprint and below market retail.
[8055.44 - 8061.86] Chris Nicholson: Community is about more than housing, and I enthusiastically added his language for the reasons he'll highlight.
[8062.11 - 8066.82] Chris Nicholson: This framework recognizes that we are not the housing policy experts.
[8067.34 - 8086.29] Chris Nicholson: It increases the scope of our tools and trusts our staff to use them effectively to bring us thoughtful projects, projects that align with our strategic priority of community value and enable us to grow ridership by putting the people who most need transit where they can best be served by it.
[8086.83 - 8088.23] Chris Nicholson: I ask your support for this amendment.
[8088.75 - 8088.95] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[8089.86 - 8090.20] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Harbert.
[8091.66 - 8108.05] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, so I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD that we're really thinking also about mixed use TOD and I'm wildly in favor of Anything that we can do to bring more housing let alone affordable housing to
[8108.03 - 8109.19] Chris Nicholson: to our park and rides.
[8109.21 - 8120.85] Chris Nicholson: I do think it's really key that we also think about what are the businesses that we are bringing in there and, you know, having spent a lot of time working at Starbucks and a good friend of mine works at Starbucks.
[8120.87 - 8129.72] Chris Nicholson: You know, I'm also really in favor of coffee shops like Prodigy and smaller shops, but also thinking about when I've traveled to other
[8129.70 - 8152.14] Chris Nicholson: Communities throughout the world there oftentimes are smaller retail shops that give Young entrepreneurs that opportunity to start a business and not be burdened by a larger footprint that Some of our larger restaurants or larger retail shops can they can cover those those costs so you know this this to me was a way to encourage local businesses to
[8152.12 - 8167.85] Chris Nicholson: start up or expand and, you know, give them the opportunity in a place that we all, you know, we all, when we go to a parking ride and there's not something there to grab that quick bite to eat, I want to give them that opportunity, everyone that opportunity, one to shop there and sell there.
[8169.41 - 8172.26] Chris Nicholson: Director Harwick, any further discussion on this amendment?
[8173.36 - 8173.96] Chris Nicholson: Director Usha.
[8174.23 - 8176.51] Chris Nicholson: Uh, Mr. Chair, maybe you can help me here.
[8176.61 - 8181.94] Chris Nicholson: So I had a comment slash, but I had a comment on the main motion, but we moved to amendments.
[8182.36 - 8188.27] Chris Nicholson: But like recognizing that Secretary Nicholson's language can't exist without the motion language of the way it's drafted.
[8188.49 - 8190.43] Chris Nicholson: May I just make a general comment?
[8190.45 - 8191.37] Chris Nicholson: Does that sort of make sense?
[8191.53 - 8196.56] Chris Nicholson: It would apply to both, but I don't know if I would be called out of order and I'm tired of what you say.
[8196.60 - 8197.20] Chris Nicholson: So you know what?
[8197.22 - 8197.64] Chris Nicholson: Why not?
[8197.72 - 8198.78] Chris Nicholson: Let's give it a try.
[8198.86 - 8199.66] Chris Nicholson: Thanks.
[8199.64 - 8200.31] Chris Nicholson: I'm doing my best.
[8200.83 - 8212.64] Chris Nicholson: Okay, so this morning we got an email from staff that addressed some outstanding questions that I still had, just so I knew what I was voting on.
[8213.20 - 8226.23] Chris Nicholson: And I have a heartburn over just the main motion because the way it's written, we as a board,
[8226.48 - 8240.03] Chris Nicholson: are not just expanding the bounds of what a policy is, we're also signing away like 30 plus years of precedent of having this guardrail that says, before you go dispense of real property, get our preliminary authorization.
[8240.65 - 8248.60] Chris Nicholson: So I guess like I've, so I am already a little bit uncomfortable.
[8249.00 - 8251.72] Chris Nicholson: And also the policy says that if
[8252.09 - 8258.58] Chris Nicholson: A developer, as it relates to housing, cannot meet our 50% standard.
[8259.04 - 8264.10] Chris Nicholson: They could still get a major discount, and it could be millions and millions of dollars.
[8264.65 - 8271.31] Chris Nicholson: And so those two combined, and just recognizing that these deals take a long, long time, they're not suburb projects.
[8272.79 - 8281.64] Chris Nicholson: In sum, it means that all of that is going to happen, and then it's going to come back to the board when all of those decisions have been made.
[8281.86 - 8301.24] Chris Nicholson: and that and so it's for that because I'm struggling with the original proposal but I can accept it for now is why I can't vote yes on Secretary Nicholson's amendment because it doesn't because we don't have guardrails that I would prefer so I
[8301.60 - 8305.69] Chris Nicholson: I hope that was not out of order and if it was, thanks for not calling me out of order.
[8305.71 - 8306.07] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[8306.41 - 8307.13] Chris Nicholson: Are you director chef?
[8307.47 - 8308.03] Chris Nicholson: Director Guzmore.
[8308.87 - 8315.64] Chris Nicholson: So, ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee and this is my concern.
[8318.45 - 8324.03] Chris Nicholson: Although I am with you in spirit, deeply affordable housing is really important.
[8324.52 - 8333.89] Chris Nicholson: I'm not sure that giving an additional 25% discount in our policy is wise for a number of reasons.
[8334.23 - 8338.68] Chris Nicholson: I do believe, however, and maybe Madam CEO or Ms.
[8338.72 - 8341.40] Chris Nicholson: Chessie Brady might be able to speak to this, I'm not sure.
[8343.21 - 8350.48] Chris Nicholson: What we were asked for in this policy was to give guidelines to begin negotiation that would eventually come back to this board.
[8351.69 - 8363.85] Chris Nicholson: Let's say a developer comes to us and just brings us an amazing proposal that includes everything that you could want in a development and more.
[8363.87 - 8369.60] Chris Nicholson: I don't see why they wouldn't necessarily come back to us and say, hey, they're willing to do all of these things.
[8369.99 - 8370.83] Chris Nicholson: They being staff.
[8371.15 - 8385.64] Chris Nicholson: and asking for an additional amount of up to whatever amount makes sense to give that discount from the board that we would consider properly and then be able to authorize in that moment.
[8386.38 - 8392.87] Chris Nicholson: But in order to begin the process, we were simply asked to give authorization for them to work within a parameter.
[8392.93 - 8399.27] Chris Nicholson: That way there was no confusion that they would be able to do a 30 to 50% discount as was written in the original policy.
[8399.77 - 8400.71] Chris Nicholson: Beyond that,
[8401.39 - 8408.38] Chris Nicholson: the board would still have authority, as I understand it, if we were asked to offer an additional discount for more.
[8409.04 - 8426.78] Chris Nicholson: I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of the agency.
[8426.94 - 8428.93] Chris Nicholson: And so I would like to ask that question
[8429.43 - 8442.38] Chris Nicholson: Is there anything that would prevent you from coming back to us if we were to receive such an excellent proposal that prevents you from saying, can we receive an additional discount to offer a developer board?
[8443.12 - 8445.33] Chris Nicholson: And would you approve this so we can make a project work?
[8447.12 - 8447.30] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[8447.32 - 8449.06] Chris Nicholson: Brady, first off, thank you for your patience.
[8449.08 - 8451.12] Chris Nicholson: I greatly appreciate you sticking around tonight.
[8451.16 - 8451.60] Chris Nicholson: Of course.
[8451.92 - 8453.20] Chris Nicholson: You're recognized.
[8453.52 - 8453.86] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[8454.53 - 8457.45] Chris Nicholson: No, there is nothing that would stop us from doing that.
[8457.93 - 8463.64] Chris Nicholson: As you say, the point of the policy is to create guardrails and certainty within those guardrails.
[8464.38 - 8473.65] Chris Nicholson: We would use the opinions of the board to guide developers towards what we think the board would be interested in as we're negotiating with them.
[8473.75 - 8474.79] Chris Nicholson: And we would come back to the board
[8475.11 - 8477.24] Chris Nicholson: for approval of any given project.
[8478.06 - 8478.42] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[8479.22 - 8491.36] Chris Nicholson: One more quick thing and Director Banker, Treasurer Banker, the sales and the lease income from our real estate properties are put into a specific account.
[8491.46 - 8492.40] Chris Nicholson: Can you guess which one?
[8493.14 - 8504.92] Chris Nicholson: Because when we deeply discount things beyond where we should, we are saying no to the potential income that we could use for operations and maintenance and service provision
[8505.55 - 8506.64] Chris Nicholson: elsewhere in the agency.
[8507.30 - 8514.91] Chris Nicholson: So on balance, real estate and real property are a finite resource, and dollars can be stretched thin.
[8515.67 - 8526.32] Chris Nicholson: But how we use the opportunity to either receive money to prolong and serve the public further is a huge consideration in this.
[8526.56 - 8531.19] Chris Nicholson: So although I am with you in spirit, I would be voting no on the amendment as it is right now.
[8531.87 - 8532.49] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Director.
[8533.43 - 8534.30] Chris Nicholson: Director Pagulieri.
[8534.63 - 8536.29] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, I'll be brief.
[8536.71 - 8541.44] Chris Nicholson: I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply agree with.
[8542.22 - 8543.80] Chris Nicholson: I am a little bit concerned about two things.
[8543.84 - 8546.54] Chris Nicholson: The first is the language deeply affordable.
[8546.56 - 8551.31] Chris Nicholson: It's a little bit ambiguous, if I'm saying that right.
[8552.29 - 8562.98] Chris Nicholson: And I think using language like that can, like, what's to say, they discounted $100 to some, that's a deep discount to others, that's nothing.
[8562.96 - 8570.91] Chris Nicholson: So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can divine it elsewhere.
[8571.43 - 8573.64] Chris Nicholson: But I do want to leave this language.
[8573.66 - 8581.95] Chris Nicholson: And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that I want.
[8581.93 - 8598.73] Chris Nicholson: And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75%, but this is our property and I really would like to see it sold for the highest value to benefit all.
[8598.95 - 8599.29] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[8599.79 - 8601.91] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Director.
[8602.89 - 8605.33] Chris Nicholson: Just a quick question.
[8605.89 - 8613.26] Chris Nicholson: Some of these surplus properties that we're talking about, we are not including our current park and rides, correct?
[8614.28 - 8620.49] Chris Nicholson: Would be excess land, perhaps around a park and ride, but not one of our park and rides.
[8622.01 - 8622.99] Chris Nicholson: Just clarification.
[8623.73 - 8624.21] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[8624.23 - 8628.16] Chris Nicholson: So this policy is aimed at transoriented development.
[8628.62 - 8630.60] Chris Nicholson: So property that RTD owns
[8630.80 - 8633.78] Chris Nicholson: at transit stations or near high frequency transit.
[8634.40 - 8647.24] Chris Nicholson: Access property and surplus property are definable terms that perhaps Michelle could help us with, but those are distinctive properties that the board has named to be excess and surplus.
[8647.66 - 8650.38] Chris Nicholson: And so I just want to separate that from a park and ride.
[8650.42 - 8652.41] Chris Nicholson: A park and ride is certainly not excess or surplus.
[8653.27 - 8655.53] Chris Nicholson: It may have underutilized land.
[8655.69 - 8659.90] Chris Nicholson: It may have a large drainage area that is part of the park and ride.
[8660.55 - 8669.41] Chris Nicholson: But not every development that we would consider on a park and ride would remove parking if that's getting more to your question.
[8670.22 - 8670.94] Chris Nicholson: Okay, yes.
[8673.42 - 8674.31] Chris Nicholson: Secretary Nicholson.
[8675.43 - 8678.14] Chris Nicholson: I actually have some questions for Ms.
[8678.66 - 8678.98] Chris Nicholson: Brady.
[8679.62 - 8684.39] Chris Nicholson: So first off, Director Pagliari raised the concern about the term deep affordability.
[8685.01 - 8689.61] Chris Nicholson: I think you and I know what that means, but maybe the rest of the board doesn't, given it's a term of art.
[8689.67 - 8693.36] Chris Nicholson: Can you elaborate on what that's referring to?
[8694.10 - 8694.26] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[8694.30 - 8694.54] Chris Nicholson: Brady.
[8694.98 - 8695.28] Chris Nicholson: Sure.
[8695.34 - 8695.52] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[8695.82 - 8703.89] Chris Nicholson: Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means generally 30 to 40% of AMI.
[8704.31 - 8709.43] Chris Nicholson: It is squishy, I think still, but generally it's understood to mean 30 to 40%.
[8709.49 - 8711.64] Chris Nicholson: Secretary.
[8712.07 - 8719.36] Chris Nicholson: So second question, I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as a discount.
[8721.04 - 8734.54] Chris Nicholson: I was hoping maybe you could speak to like, because I mentioned it a little bit, but as someone who's an expert in the space, and I will say you and I worked pretty closely together on this language and went back and forth, you did a meeting with me.
[8734.62 - 8737.02] Chris Nicholson: So this isn't just something that I wrote myself.
[8737.10 - 8741.47] Chris Nicholson: This is something that got vetted pretty heavily by staff.
[8742.40 - 8758.02] Chris Nicholson: What impact does a greater discount have on the types of projects that in the affordable housing space you tend to see people able to build?
[8758.08 - 8762.24] Chris Nicholson: At least from where I sit, the reason for doing this is that
[8762.22 - 8771.86] Chris Nicholson: When it comes to those deeply affordable, which are deeply subsidized units, when it comes to things like units that are fully accessible, those are expensive.
[8772.12 - 8778.55] Chris Nicholson: They cost developers money, which is why when you don't have those subsidies, those units don't get built.
[8778.61 - 8782.26] Chris Nicholson: I think it's about half the projects that are in the CHFA database.
[8782.24 - 8790.49] Chris Nicholson: have zero units at 30% AMI and very few of them have anything with regard to accessibility.
[8790.51 - 8796.56] Chris Nicholson: So I'm hoping you can maybe elaborate on, you know, you're the one who would be using this tool at the end of the day.
[8796.60 - 8801.25] Chris Nicholson: How do you see it coming in handy with regard to what you're able to do?
[8801.87 - 8803.33] Chris Nicholson: And then I've won the last follow up.
[8805.15 - 8805.49] Chris Nicholson: It's pretty.
[8809.16 - 8809.46] Chris Nicholson: You're not.
[8813.18 - 8820.07] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[8820.79 - 8824.78] Chris Nicholson: So affordable housing projects aren't notoriously difficult to finance.
[8825.48 - 8836.13] Chris Nicholson: And I mean, I think if you use the example earlier of tapestry and Denver health, Denver health, as you stated is correct donated the land for tapestry.
[8836.17 - 8840.24] Chris Nicholson: I can assure you that that development was still very difficult to finance.
[8841.08 - 8841.34] Chris Nicholson: So
[8841.57 - 8851.04] Chris Nicholson: even if the land we were giving the land at 100% discount, the projects would still not pencil in many cases.
[8851.56 - 8869.89] Chris Nicholson: And so our ability to discount the land to 75% as the board prefers just in many cases could get us over the hump from a project not being built to a project being built and to that project having more affordable units as opposed to
[8870.10 - 8873.65] Chris Nicholson: a higher, more of a middle income range.
[8874.31 - 8876.75] Chris Nicholson: And that's the difference that the land discount makes.
[8877.11 - 8887.70] Chris Nicholson: And that's the certainty that this policy helps me bring to conversations with developers is, gets them in the mindset of we're going to get some help here from RTD.
[8888.48 - 8891.11] Chris Nicholson: We can focus on deeper affordability units.
[8891.13 - 8898.48] Chris Nicholson: We can make bigger promises to Chaffa or other financing entities to host in Denver.
[8898.88 - 8900.84] Chris Nicholson: It helps us keep the projects moving.
[8901.42 - 8909.05] Chris Nicholson: Um, but, and I'd be frank with you, this is, as I said, tapestry, even with a hundred percent discount, it's still hard to do.
[8909.23 - 8910.57] Chris Nicholson: This is not a silver bullet.
[8911.17 - 8917.14] Chris Nicholson: Um, but it, it moves the needle and it helps us actually, you know, keep projects afloat and get to the finish line.
[8917.56 - 8918.00] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Ms.
[8918.02 - 8918.36] Chris Nicholson: Brady.
[8918.60 - 8921.96] Chris Nicholson: We're going to wrap up with director O'Keith and then director Larson.
[8922.46 - 8924.14] Chris Nicholson: Oh, I thought I got last word.
[8924.85 - 8927.85] Chris Nicholson: So, I support this amendment.
[8927.99 - 8939.16] Chris Nicholson: I think it is a reasonable step toward developing communities that are very likely to use our services.
[8939.30 - 8943.53] Chris Nicholson: And I think increasing ridership is something
[8943.51 - 8944.61] Chris Nicholson: we all agree on.
[8944.65 - 8946.92] Chris Nicholson: This is a concrete way to do that.
[8948.02 - 8958.05] Chris Nicholson: It also takes land not just for our benefit in ridership, but also puts improvements on it that helps the tax base.
[8958.47 - 8972.35] Chris Nicholson: And I think the communities that we serve would rather see a housing project end up on that property where it becomes improved.
[8972.33 - 8973.82] Chris Nicholson: versus somewhere else.
[8973.83 - 8975.14] Chris Nicholson: We're not the only game in town.
[8975.18 - 8976.78] Chris Nicholson: There's a lot of discounts out there.
[8977.52 - 8983.50] Chris Nicholson: And so we're not necessarily in a tight buyers market.
[8983.65 - 8985.91] Chris Nicholson: There's a lot of projects that can go forward.
[8986.59 - 8994.80] Chris Nicholson: And I think we need to put our best deal, at least give Chessie and the rest of the team the tools to bring the deal forward.
[8995.76 - 8997.28] Chris Nicholson: I do want to put one plug in.
[8997.32 - 8998.18] Chris Nicholson: We talked about it.
[8998.48 - 9000.70] Chris Nicholson: I don't think round leases
[9000.68 - 9003.39] Chris Nicholson: are the best tool in Colorado.
[9003.43 - 9006.79] Chris Nicholson: First of all, it's not as common as other places in the world.
[9007.43 - 9015.64] Chris Nicholson: And the other thing is toward the end of your ground lease, no matter how long you make it, the property will fall into disrepair.
[9015.94 - 9021.41] Chris Nicholson: They are not going to put money into physical facilities that are going to roll off their books.
[9021.39 - 9029.08] Chris Nicholson: So, for that reason, I like the discount is great and I love a sale versus a ground lease.
[9029.10 - 9031.38] Chris Nicholson: And I know you'll keep that in mind as we go forward.
[9032.08 - 9039.88] Chris Nicholson: And anyway, that's another argument in favor of that tactic.
[9039.90 - 9040.46] Chris Nicholson: Director Bill Arson.
[9042.40 - 9042.86] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[9043.10 - 9046.49] Chris Nicholson: I'm going to be a no vote on this.
[9046.94 - 9050.76] Chris Nicholson: I don't agree with our transit oriented development policy as it is right now.
[9050.98 - 9057.75] Chris Nicholson: I don't agree with the goal of trying to provide affordable housing or encourage it, incentivize it.
[9058.13 - 9062.20] Chris Nicholson: I think we should be focused on trying to increase ridership.
[9062.22 - 9071.95] Chris Nicholson: If we want to provide discounts on our land, we should provide them with the goal in mind of increasing the number of people that can live
[9072.33 - 9077.22] Chris Nicholson: on the property, whatever is developed, and the amount of traffic that is on the property.
[9078.38 - 9080.82] Chris Nicholson: So I'm a no on this.
[9081.50 - 9082.40] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Director Larson.
[9082.55 - 9082.84] Chris Nicholson: All right.
[9083.26 - 9085.25] Chris Nicholson: The indication there is a no vote.
[9085.59 - 9087.11] Chris Nicholson: I am going to do a roll call vote.
[9087.19 - 9090.33] Chris Nicholson: As a reminder, we are voting on Director Nicholson's amendment.
[9090.83 - 9093.75] Chris Nicholson: He was the mover and Director Harwick is the second.
[9094.54 - 9095.26] Chris Nicholson: Treasure banker.
[9098.62 - 9098.80] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9098.82 - 9099.44] Chris Nicholson: Director Catlin.
[9100.92 - 9101.26] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9102.07 - 9102.87] Chris Nicholson: Director Keisinger?
[9103.19 - 9103.75] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9103.77 - 9104.57] Chris Nicholson: Director Gucinander?
[9105.09 - 9105.61] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9105.63 - 9106.31] Chris Nicholson: Director Guzman?
[9106.59 - 9107.74] Chris Nicholson: No.
[9107.75 - 9108.40] Chris Nicholson: Director Harwick?
[9108.56 - 9108.80] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9109.72 - 9110.46] Chris Nicholson: Director Larsen?
[9111.42 - 9111.62] Chris Nicholson: No.
[9112.72 - 9113.92] Chris Nicholson: Secretary Nicholson?
[9113.94 - 9114.18] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9115.06 - 9115.91] Chris Nicholson: First Vice-Chair O'Keefe?
[9116.71 - 9116.93] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9117.49 - 9118.27] Chris Nicholson: Director Pagulari?
[9118.75 - 9119.01] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9119.57 - 9120.21] Chris Nicholson: Director Ruscha?
[9122.87 - 9123.45] Chris Nicholson: Sorry, no.
[9124.38 - 9125.80] Chris Nicholson: And finally, Second Vice-Chair Whitmore?
[9126.36 - 9126.66] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9127.47 - 9138.66] Chris Nicholson: Okay, and I am a yes, that amendment will pass 10, two, excuse me, 10, three and two.
[9140.84 - 9145.65] Chris Nicholson: Yes, 10, yes, three, no, two absent, that is the math.
[9146.25 - 9152.66] Chris Nicholson: Okay, moving on, we are gonna do our second amendment, which was brought forward by Director Ruscha.
[9154.13 - 9157.55] Chris Nicholson: And Director Ruscha, would you like to introduce the language of the amendment?
[9159.45 - 9162.36] Chris Nicholson: It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman.
[9163.04 - 9170.07] Chris Nicholson: And I think he has the language in front of him.
[9170.09 - 9171.21] Chris Nicholson: Director Guzman.
[9171.23 - 9172.21] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[9172.25 - 9183.34] Chris Nicholson: We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end of this policy that says, additionally, no project will be eligible for any discounts unless it complies with the greater of the following.
[9184.15 - 9195.53] Chris Nicholson: 5% of all units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities and an additional 2% of all units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities or to current U.S.
[9195.55 - 9198.62] Chris Nicholson: Department of Housing, Urban Development Accessibility requirements.
[9200.92 - 9201.70] Chris Nicholson: Do you have a second?
[9202.75 - 9203.77] Chris Nicholson: We have Russia's second.
[9204.83 - 9205.91] Chris Nicholson: Uh, Mr. Crow.
[9205.93 - 9206.27] Chris Nicholson: I'm sorry.
[9206.63 - 9218.21] Chris Nicholson: Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the highlighted portion above would be deleted and is not included in your motion.
[9218.27 - 9218.65] Chris Nicholson: Correct?
[9218.75 - 9219.09] Chris Nicholson: Correct.
[9221.97 - 9222.13] Chris Nicholson: Correct.
[9222.15 - 9225.88] Chris Nicholson: So the language we see, this would substitute the language.
[9226.42 - 9226.72] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[9226.88 - 9227.18] Chris Nicholson: Perfect.
[9227.60 - 9231.91] Chris Nicholson: Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get this done.
[9231.93 - 9232.45] Chris Nicholson: Director Russia.
[9233.91 - 9238.80] Chris Nicholson: I was happy to speak to motion, but I wasn't sure if we were, I'm tired.
[9239.10 - 9239.46] Chris Nicholson: Is that okay?
[9240.50 - 9240.60] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[9240.62 - 9244.73] Chris Nicholson: I got Guzman as the mover and Risha as the second and we're up for a conversation.
[9244.81 - 9244.99] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[9245.01 - 9245.73] Chris Nicholson: You're up, Dr. Risha.
[9246.09 - 9246.51] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, sir.
[9246.55 - 9246.83] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[9246.85 - 9263.19] Chris Nicholson: So just for everyone's identification, we struck the first sentence, it was a two sentence amendment, just recognizing that we didn't have full staff concurrence on the first sentence, which would have applied this accessibility minimum to market rate housing.
[9263.17 - 9268.00] Chris Nicholson: And sometimes you shoot for the stars and land on the moon.
[9269.00 - 9276.43] Chris Nicholson: The second sentence, which just applies the HUD requirement to affordable housing, we did get staff concurrence.
[9276.45 - 9278.98] Chris Nicholson: So that's just the, that was the context behind that.
[9280.74 - 9282.26] Chris Nicholson: I sent out like a
[9283.39 - 9290.70] Chris Nicholson: I kind of frequently ask questions in anticipation of some questions, so I'm happy to entertain any or we can address them.
[9291.20 - 9312.55] Chris Nicholson: I will say that we worked for three weeks and some change on this with housing advocates and folks who had worked in the space and people who had worked at CHAFA and at the state level on similar policy and advocacy organizations and then staff and legal.
[9312.95 - 9322.21] Chris Nicholson: So, I mean, just, I'm sorry, I am tired, too.
[9322.47 - 9334.41] Chris Nicholson: In case anybody has any questions about what this is, I think just simplify it and say that HUD has a
[9334.67 - 9338.44] Chris Nicholson: current minimum accessibility requirement for funding, right?
[9338.54 - 9347.11] Chris Nicholson: And it's 5% of units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, additional 2% of units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities.
[9347.91 - 9355.54] Chris Nicholson: And so a lot of times in these projects, that HUD requirement is going to kick in, but not all projects are going to have HUD dollars.
[9356.14 - 9361.31] Chris Nicholson: So just recognizing that a lot of jurisdictions take that HUD standard, which is
[9361.52 - 9366.27] Chris Nicholson: I maybe miss Brady can correct me, but I think it's 20 plus years old, 30 plus years old now.
[9366.87 - 9371.91] Chris Nicholson: Um, and they also incorporate that into their policies or their code or statute.
[9372.19 - 9375.02] Chris Nicholson: We did the same kind of good for goose, good for gander.
[9375.80 - 9378.06] Chris Nicholson: Um, I will stop there.
[9378.08 - 9387.53] Chris Nicholson: Uh, unless anyone else has further questions or, or comment questions or comments on this amendment, uh, Dr. Catlin and then secretary Nicholson.
[9388.91 - 9404.83] Chris Nicholson: I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the First Amendment that we passed does give a lot of latitude towards Chessie and her staff to negotiate.
[9405.56 - 9413.99] Chris Nicholson: And I fear that this one might be a little bit too regulatory and prescriptive.
[9415.71 - 9425.74] Chris Nicholson: If that's the HUD requirement and somebody is applying for a HUD grant, then this would be taken care of automatically.
[9426.34 - 9435.45] Chris Nicholson: So right now I'm willing to listen to other discussions, but I fear that it would not give Ms.
[9435.49 - 9442.64] Chris Nicholson: Brady and her staff the maximum flexibility to look at the comprehensive merits of a proposal.
[9445.44 - 9447.00] Chris Nicholson: Um, yeah, Ms.
[9447.02 - 9448.44] Chris Nicholson: Spriby.
[9448.46 - 9448.66] Chris Nicholson: Yeah.
[9448.82 - 9461.50] Chris Nicholson: So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver already requires, for example, and the Colorado Department of Housing is already considering a higher threshold of requirement.
[9461.58 - 9464.38] Chris Nicholson: So I have, I have no concerns about incorporating this.
[9464.46 - 9468.12] Chris Nicholson: I think it, it's already going to be taken care of in most cases.
[9468.52 - 9471.16] Chris Nicholson: If I might, that's kind of my point.
[9471.26 - 9472.87] Chris Nicholson: It seems a little bit redundant.
[9476.34 - 9477.14] Chris Nicholson: Secretary Nicholson.
[9478.22 - 9481.39] Chris Nicholson: I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's all right.
[9482.99 - 9483.57] Chris Nicholson: To the amendment.
[9483.75 - 9484.17] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[9485.40 - 9486.80] Chris Nicholson: Just to clarify, that was a question.
[9486.92 - 9488.62] Chris Nicholson: You would like to offer an amendment to the amendment?
[9488.98 - 9489.14] Chris Nicholson: Yes.
[9490.67 - 9491.33] Chris Nicholson: Let's have an amendment.
[9491.54 - 9492.99] Chris Nicholson: Mr. Krull.
[9493.00 - 9521.38] Chris Nicholson: Technically the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy and this is an amendment to that amendment and at this point you would be amending an amendment to an amendment which is not allowed under Robert's rules so you would need to tackle this amendment as it's being presented and then if you feel so inclined offer an amendment to whatever state the
[9521.36 - 9547.44] Chris Nicholson: uh policy is in at that point rock on uh secretary yeah so at that point i would say i'd have to be a no been for the very simple reason um where it says no project will be eligible we're talking about an uh equitable tod policy here um which is specifically focused on using our land to facilitate like the literally the policy is about giving discounts um i can't see
[9547.42 - 9570.44] Chris Nicholson: putting something like this in there unless it is related to said discount so I'd be fine if it said additionally no project receiving a discount will be eligible for any discounts etc unless it complies with but I don't necessarily think it makes sense to do market rate policy in an etod policy thank you secretary i have treasurer banker and then director isha
[9570.64 - 9571.96] Chris Nicholson: It's just real quick.
[9572.00 - 9585.20] Chris Nicholson: Have you perhaps considered something more positive saying something like along the lines greater consideration would be given a project if these items were attained as opposed to make it mandatory?
[9588.18 - 9589.79] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Risha or Dr. Kisman?
[9589.81 - 9592.19] Chris Nicholson: Again, sort of an amendment, but just a thought.
[9592.97 - 9593.11] Chris Nicholson: Thanks.
[9593.13 - 9597.44] Chris Nicholson: So I just want to address what Secretary Nicholson said.
[9597.86 - 9605.89] Chris Nicholson: I might have missed part of the closed captioning, but I think you said you don't think we should be applying accessibility minimums to market rate.
[9606.83 - 9607.05] Chris Nicholson: Okay.
[9607.39 - 9607.99] Chris Nicholson: That's exact.
[9608.19 - 9608.51] Chris Nicholson: We don't.
[9608.83 - 9609.69] Chris Nicholson: So this amendment doesn't do that.
[9610.09 - 9623.23] Chris Nicholson: And the second piece, um, the reason why I didn't say it doesn't reference discounts is because, uh, so this goes at the end of the policy, which is all, like the way it's nested under the paragraph, the discount, this is talking about when discounts apply, if that makes sense.
[9623.61 - 9624.39] Chris Nicholson: So it's just,
[9625.90 - 9629.17] Chris Nicholson: It does what you said you wanted it to do.
[9629.19 - 9630.13] Chris Nicholson: It's just late.
[9630.67 - 9631.19] Chris Nicholson: On Nicholson.
[9631.41 - 9631.75] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[9632.17 - 9636.36] Chris Nicholson: And then the, I guess the only question I have for, and this is actually for Ms.
[9636.40 - 9637.90] Chris Nicholson: Brady, if that's okay.
[9638.40 - 9650.14] Chris Nicholson: Under what, because you mentioned that Denver has a policy that supersede or that matches this and the state currently is considering a policy that would supersede it, but currently does not.
[9650.67 - 9654.66] Chris Nicholson: Under what circumstances would this have any effect at all?
[9654.84 - 9662.93] Chris Nicholson: Like in what circumstances can you imagine in your professional capacity, do you see this being something that would matter?
[9664.03 - 9664.19] Chris Nicholson: Ms.
[9664.23 - 9664.51] Chris Nicholson: Brady?
[9665.28 - 9669.68] Chris Nicholson: Yes, in a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units.
[9669.84 - 9675.07] Chris Nicholson: And Director Rush has mentioned some, I'm not aware of them, but this is not my area of expertise.
[9675.09 - 9680.06] Chris Nicholson: So, but in a jurisdiction that does not already have those requirements that is not
[9680.26 - 9693.94] Chris Nicholson: accepting HUD money, and if Colorado Department of Housing changes their rules, does not accept Department of Housing money, then that project would then be subject to this policy requirement.
[9695.82 - 9696.24] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Ms.
[9696.28 - 9696.56] Chris Nicholson: Breedy.
[9696.88 - 9697.70] Chris Nicholson: Secretary, quickly.
[9698.54 - 9710.18] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, just, I guess, for Director Rusher, Director Guzman, are there any jurisdictions in the RTD service area that don't have that same requirement that Denver does?
[9712.10 - 9712.90] Chris Nicholson: either directors?
[9714.30 - 9718.99] Chris Nicholson: Yeah, I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate jurisdictions.
[9719.05 - 9727.38] Chris Nicholson: So I'm just going to have to lean into this is E TOD and the E is equitable.
[9727.90 - 9733.29] Chris Nicholson: We spend a lot of time talking about equity today, including spending a significant amount of time talking about people with disabilities.
[9733.81 - 9739.54] Chris Nicholson: And so just again, recognizing that the HUD requirement
[9742.61 - 9758.49] Chris Nicholson: is about equity and not excluding people on the basis of disability from accessing affordable housing because the FH Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and other areas of anti-discrimination law, including state law, don't effectively
[9759.00 - 9760.38] Chris Nicholson: covered that aspect.
[9761.60 - 9763.04] Chris Nicholson: Sorry, that was more than what you asked.
[9763.06 - 9765.12] Chris Nicholson: But no, I can't answer your question.
[9766.87 - 9777.08] Chris Nicholson: Just like you probably couldn't answer my question about every single jurisdiction in the RTD region that has something regarding parking minimums.
[9778.02 - 9779.13] Chris Nicholson: It's a broad concept.
[9780.53 - 9781.29] Chris Nicholson: Thank you, Director Usha.
[9781.73 - 9783.77] Chris Nicholson: Any further conversation on this amendment?
[9784.92 - 9785.64] Chris Nicholson: Dr. Guzman.
[9785.66 - 9787.40] Chris Nicholson: I will offer this last thing.
[9787.73 - 9801.91] Chris Nicholson: and then we probably should go to a vote, but very simply put, we need to make sure that we are protecting the vulnerable, providing access to these housing units.
[9802.19 - 9805.48] Chris Nicholson: Even in the city and county of Denver's building codes is not clear.
[9805.54 - 9806.84] Chris Nicholson: It's as clear as mud.
[9807.14 - 9813.33] Chris Nicholson: There is reference to this if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not necessarily required.
[9813.37 - 9822.16] Chris Nicholson: We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to get licensed.
[9822.84 - 9835.41] Chris Nicholson: And so to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units, I would like to see this in the policy.
[9835.59 - 9848.38] Chris Nicholson: I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement that's established.
[9848.42 - 9860.66] Chris Nicholson: And although it is established in other places, it is not established in our policy, and we are the government of this region, and we should take it seriously that we have a due diligence and responsibility to those members of our community that would need this.
[9860.88 - 9863.12] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[9864.68 - 9870.37] Chris Nicholson: I always have to follow you, Director Guzman, but obviously I'm very in support.
[9870.63 - 9881.67] Chris Nicholson: Any time that we can be supportive of our communities most in need, those suffering from a whole variety of disabilities, I want to be able to put our best foot forward there.
[9882.11 - 9886.54] Chris Nicholson: And while we can't call specific jurisdictions, if there is that
[9886.52 - 9893.50] Chris Nicholson: chance that there is a jurisdiction that isn't meeting this requirement, then we should make sure we're getting there.
[9893.56 - 9899.09] Chris Nicholson: And if in the process the state comes up with something better or something in the future, that's okay.
[9899.45 - 9906.50] Chris Nicholson: But I think that this is a safety net in my mind about how to really get there for this community.
[9908.73 - 9925.16] Chris Nicholson: I think that also, as we're tying these developments, spur off around our transit, that's also giving them better access to the resources and giving them the life that they want and the freedom of movement that we so cherish.
[9925.22 - 9927.24] Chris Nicholson: So I'm highly in support of this.
[9927.22 - 9927.56] Chris Nicholson: Thank you.
[9928.04 - 9929.30] Chris Nicholson: Secretary, less than 30 seconds.
[9930.61 - 9934.17] Chris Nicholson: This question is for Chessie.
[9934.41 - 9942.30] Chris Nicholson: My understanding with this language is that it applies to buildings with elevators in it.
[9942.42 - 9956.98] Chris Nicholson: And so with single stair buildings, that there are different policies around equitable access because of the challenges, obviously, in a single stair building of getting people into the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth floor.
[9957.28 - 9960.69] Chris Nicholson: You're probably the biggest expert on this in the room.
[9961.87 - 9973.16] Chris Nicholson: Do you see any concerns with this language when it comes to buildings with stairs only versus elevators?
[9973.86 - 9983.58] Chris Nicholson: I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable, I do know that equitable access and accessible units are different things and have different requirements.
[9984.40 - 9987.89] Chris Nicholson: And so we're talking specifically about accessible units.

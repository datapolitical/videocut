Julien Bouquet	[0.335-33.677]	I'll now call the Wednesday, May 28 RTD Board meeting to order.
Julien Bouquet	[34.076-35.395]	We're convened as of 7:00 PM.
Julien Bouquet	[35.839-41.349]	I would respectfully ask everyone to remain muted unless you're recognized to speak.
Julien Bouquet	[41.848-43.987]	Thank you all for joining us this evening.
Julien Bouquet	[44.913-57.144]	As the Board has moved to in-person meetings for monthly gatherings, please note that committee meetings of the RTD Board of Directors will still be held remotely via Zoom, and will be audio and video recorded.
Julien Bouquet	[58.267-65.498]	The meeting recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as practical on the Board's website.
Julien Bouquet	[66.343-66.781]	Visit rtd-denver.com.
Julien Bouquet	[67.220-72.918]	And a livestream of this meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page.

Julien Bouquet	[102.243-106.302]	I'll now ask Secretary Nicholson, could you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?
Chris Nicholson	[111.963-120.340]	I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands.
Chris Nicholson	[120.781-128.872]	One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Julien Bouquet	[128.872-129.366]	Thank you, Secretary.
Julien Bouquet	[130.735-133.430]	I will now read the land acknowledgment.
Julien Bouquet	[134.660-146.636]	The RTD Board of Directors acknowledges the land on which our buses and trains operate is their traditional territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other contemporary tribal nations that are historically tied to these lands.
Julien Bouquet	[147.759-154.738]	We honor our Indigenous elders who have traveled, inhabited, and stewarded these mountains, hills, and plains throughout generations.
Julien Bouquet	[155.635-169.157]	May this acknowledgment demonstrate a commitment to working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of inequity of the Native and all historically oppressed peoples, and recognize their current and future contributions in the district as we move forward.
Julien Bouquet	[170.694-171.383]	I'll now call the roll.

Julien Bouquet	[214.518-214.947]	OK.

Julien Bouquet	[215.592-216.742]	And Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
Troy Whitmore	[216.742-216.912]	I'm here.
Julien Bouquet	[218.304-218.304]	Awesome.
Julien Bouquet	[218.865-221.920]	We have 13 present, two absent.
Julien Bouquet	[223.633-223.784]	Pardon me.
Julien Bouquet	[225.817-227.185]	Moving on to our retiree awards.
Julien Bouquet	[227.800-229.659]	There are no retiree awards for this evening.
Julien Bouquet	[230.324-235.335]	Second quarter retiree awards will be announced at the June 24 Board of Directors meeting.
Julien Bouquet	[236.956-241.686]	Next is our public participation period, which is open to anyone who would like to address the Board.
Julien Bouquet	[242.886-250.079]	As we have both in-person and remote attendees, in-person comments will go first, followed by those who are participating remotely.
Julien Bouquet	[251.881-255.545]	For those attending in person, please come up to the podium when your name is called.
Julien Bouquet	[256.569-262.627]	If you have not already signed up to speak and would like to do so, please approach the podium, when I call for any additional speakers.
Julien Bouquet	[263.618-270.620]	For those attending virtually, if you wish to speak and have not already done so, please raise your virtual hand or press star 9 on your phone.
Julien Bouquet	[271.950-274.426]	Staff will unmute you when it is your turn to speak.
Julien Bouquet	[274.694-278.219]	If you're dialed in, press star 6 to toggle your mute settings.
Julien Bouquet	[279.421-282.880]	Please bear in mind that by participating in this process, you are being recorded.
Julien Bouquet	[284.008-287.545]	If you do not wish to be recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted via writing.
Julien Bouquet	[288.425-301.815]	If any speaker has documentation or reference materials for the Board, or if any member of the public would like to submit written comments, please email those materials to the Board Office at rtd.directors@rtd-denver.com.
Julien Bouquet	[302.887-306.233]	During this time, the Board will not offer any direct comments or responses.
Julien Bouquet	[307.033-317.187]	However, if you'd like to be contacted regarding your public comment, please email the RTD Board Office at rtd.directors@rtd- denver.com.
Julien Bouquet	[317.187-322.534]	Speakers should begin their remarks by stating their names and will have up to three minutes to provide their comments.
Julien Bouquet	[324.357-328.683]	Our first speaker tonight will be Joan Peck, Longmont mayor.
Joan Peck	[335.033-335.592]	Good evening.
Joan Peck	[336.151-345.091]	Chair Bouquet and Director Johnson and Board, thank you so much for letting me address you tonight.
Joan Peck	[346.551-353.903]	I am here representing not only the city of Longmont, but the Front Range Passenger Rail District Board, which I am the secretary of.
Joan Peck	[354.203-362.685]	I want you to know right off the bat that the Board has as many questions about this new draft of IGA that you do.
Joan Peck	[363.799-375.239]	So we are looking at it, scrutinizing it as well, but are very, very excited about the prospect of being able to work together and see this rail come to completion.
Joan Peck	[376.521-385.843]	I also want to thank this Board for the partnership that we have with our RIDE Longmont.
Joan Peck	[386.485-395.038]	We have exceeded 27,000 rides since December, which far outpaced the parent company of Via in Seattle.
Joan Peck	[396.254-401.002]	So we're really proud of that, and that is directly because of the partnership we are doing with you.
Joan Peck	[401.318-402.552]	So thank you very much.
Joan Peck	[404.661-409.004]	I am also going to ask for the LX1 to be restored.
Joan Peck	[409.386-423.094]	I get a little frustrated when you use ridership as a reason for not restoring that, because Bustang now, which is at the Firestone hub, is packed.
Joan Peck	[424.244-429.552]	Those buses are packed and that ridership should belong to RTD.
Joan Peck	[430.083-443.672]	And it makes me sad that that bus was cut and our people now aren't interested that much in RTD because Bustang is taking care of it and getting our money.
Joan Peck	[445.840-458.243]	I also want to let you know that I'm going to-- I'm switching hats here from the FRPR Board as well as city of Longmont.
Joan Peck	[459.054-465.615]	I want you to know that I am very excited about this rail for many reasons.
Joan Peck	[466.542-474.018]	First of all, it's an economic driver, and it is a huge project that I think that we should take pride in together.
Joan Peck	[474.406-489.679]	And to think about-- I know the cost is huge on both sides, but when we first heard about the cost of the Northwest corridor in about 2017, it was $1.2 or $1.4 billion.
Joan Peck	[490.119-496.873]	And now BNSF's value to you, to RTD, is 650 million.
Joan Peck	[498.229-518.592]	So that is quite a difference, and part of that is due to the fact that the last three cities on the Northwest corridor, Westminster, Broomfield, and Louisville are being taken off of your plate and FRPR is going to operate them.
Joan Peck	[521.456-526.204]	I don't know, as none of us know, how that funding is going to work out.
Joan Peck	[527.382-532.726]	But what I would like to offer and invite the RTD Executive Board.
Joan Peck	[533.171-548.019]	I think, I believe that when we sit down face to face and work out what it is we think can happen-- because our boards are the ones that are going to decide this, one way or the other.
Joan Peck	[548.409-549.548]	We're the ones that are going to vote.
Joan Peck	[550.512-573.436]	So if you would think about the Executive Committee and the Executive Board or Committee of FRPR and RTD sitting down together and just diving into this IGA and trying to figure out what can we vote for, what will really work for both of us, both districts.
Joan Peck	[575.063-584.660]	For me, that would be better in being able to see people face to face, emotions, talking and just working through it.
Joan Peck	[585.918-591.214]	Because I never like going through third parties telling us what we should or shouldn't be doing.
Joan Peck	[592.667-596.605]	But I understand that the Joint Service is probably going to happen.
Joan Peck	[597.523-598.794]	How do we want it to happen?
Joan Peck	[599.748-603.018]	And it is our boards that will decide that in the end.
Joan Peck	[604.197-609.756]	So thank you very much, and let's just keep rolling along.
Julien Bouquet	[612.094-612.711]	Thank you, Mayor Peck.
Julien Bouquet	[613.838-614.903]	Next up, we have Dr.
Julien Bouquet	[615.169-615.169]	Kay Baumann.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[615.169-625.112]	Well, good afternoon.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[625.466-627.049]	My name is Reverend Dr.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[627.444-629.818]	Kay Palmer Marsh, and I'm from Longmont, Colorado.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[630.916-634.151]	And I want to congratulate-- and thank you for having us all here.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[634.482-635.293]	I really appreciate it.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[635.604-638.128]	Thank you, Board, for the public participation.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[639.311-642.231]	I want to thank you for what you've done in the past.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[643.017-649.710]	You've had courage, vision, and guts to start this FasTracks program.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[650.731-656.197]	I mean, I remember when I first moved to Denver 40 years ago, there was no such thing.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[656.581-657.434]	I came from Chicago.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[657.719-664.173]	And there was no such thing, and the Board had this vision and you went forward with it.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[664.535-672.308]	And now there's a little bit of-- I think more than a little bit of hesitation about coming in all the way up to Longmont.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[674.508-677.372]	Well, I want you to know that Longmont is a wonderful place.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[679.113-685.628]	We just don't trust you all that much anymore because we've been paying for all the tax-- been paying taxes since 2005.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[687.204-704.015]	But we're looking forward to this Board having the courage and the guts and the vision to make this happen for our community and communities down the line that have been paying taxes since 2005 on this.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[705.033-707.881]	We voted to support this, and we still support it.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[709.117-711.108]	It's just a little touchy right now.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[712.361-714.129]	I do want to address equity.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[715.444-727.014]	We look at equity in Longmont as how come Highlands Ranch has access to this wonderful rail?
Kay Palmer Marsh	[727.839-732.319]	How come Boulder has so many buses?
Kay Palmer Marsh	[733.086-736.113]	And in Longmont, we don't have so many buses.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[736.551-737.272]	We keep getting cut.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[737.913-740.630]	And of course, we don't have our rail yet either.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[741.578-744.592]	And so we look at equity in a different way than you do.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[744.863-764.366]	I also know that you have looked at equity in terms of-- in a different way that doesn't really make sense to us when we look at Boulder being very high income and having all their buses and good transportation.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[765.483-771.874]	Highlands Ranch is another good example of a fairly high income community that has access to passenger rail.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[772.933-780.090]	We, in Longmont, look for a more-- shall I say, a looser version of the equity argument.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[781.290-786.326]	Right now it looks like the equity argument is being used so that we won't get it.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[788.144-788.879]	On the other hand.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[789.124-790.104]	I've heard some good things.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[790.509-793.449]	I'm excited about what could happen.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[794.017-801.489]	Again, Longmont is still-- we're developing trust, I hope, with the RTD.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[802.228-804.043]	My neighbors don't particularly trust you.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[804.406-812.736]	When I was walking around with one petition or another, they didn't want to even let me in the door when I said RTD.
Kay Palmer Marsh	[813.090-820.501]	So thank you for this opportunity and I strongly support the Northwest Rail and I hope you will too.
Julien Bouquet	[822.603-823.668]	Thank you, Reverend Dr.
Julien Bouquet	[824.023-825.797]	Madelyn Marsh is our next speaker.
Madelyn Marsh	[829.602-832.706]	Thank you, Board members, for allowing us to speak tonight.
Madelyn Marsh	[833.091-833.877]	My name is Madelyn Marsh.
Madelyn Marsh	[834.094-840.476]	I'm also from Longmont, and I voted for FasTracks in my very first election.
Madelyn Marsh	[840.933-856.879]	I was a brand new 18- year-old in 2004, and here we are 21 years later, and we still don't-- instead of a train to Longmont or more dedicated bus services, even, you have cut services to Longmont.
Madelyn Marsh	[857.259-869.915]	And so it's frustrating to be here asking for more or for what we voted for and what you're legally obligated to provide based on the results of that election.
Madelyn Marsh	[871.221-877.194]	In the 21 years since I voted for that, I ended up living in Chicago for a few years.
Madelyn Marsh	[877.546-880.635]	I enjoyed a robust public transit system.
Madelyn Marsh	[881.910-885.213]	I enjoyed the-- I took the bus, I took trains to work.
Madelyn Marsh	[885.473-886.595]	I took trains to play.
Madelyn Marsh	[886.935-889.123]	I took trains to the suburbs, to the city.
Madelyn Marsh	[889.377-892.278]	And it was an economic driver for every community that was involved.
Madelyn Marsh	[892.963-895.453]	There's bustling downtowns wherever you go.
Madelyn Marsh	[896.349-910.032]	And like others have said, the people in Longmont are not inclined to trust RTD because the trust has been broken, that we keep getting pushed off and pushed off and pushed off.
Madelyn Marsh	[910.252-932.079]	And so I would ask that you vote in favor of the Northwest Rail expansion, but also that you don't limit it to three trips every weekday, but that you have the vision to allow us to bring our money to Denver, to other communities for entertainment purposes as well as work purposes.
Madelyn Marsh	[933.667-935.319]	Thank you very much for your time.
Julien Bouquet	[936.274-936.701]	Thank you, Madelyn.
Julien Bouquet	[937.555-939.359]	I have Connor Shea as our next speaker.
Connor Shea	[952.692-953.186]	Good evening, Board.
Connor Shea	[954.495-956.969]	My name is Connor Shea and I live in the Baker neighborhood of Denver.
Connor Shea	[957.720-961.831]	I'm here representing the Baker Historic Neighborhood Association as a member of its board.
Connor Shea	[962.688-967.300]	I live a few blocks from the Alameda station, and I use RTD's bus and rail services pretty frequently.
Connor Shea	[968.557-977.475]	As you're probably aware, Denver is in the process of considering a women's soccer league stadium at the former Gates Rubber Factory site, just west of the I-25 and Broadway Station.
Connor Shea	[978.528-993.692]	As the stadium will be across from the freight rail tracks-- across the freight rail tracks from the RTD station, transit riders need to cross over the FasTracks to reach the stadium from the various RTD bus and rail stations-- bus and rail connections at the station.
Connor Shea	[995.224-1001.434]	Currently, the only pedestrian access route from the Broadway Station is the Southern Bridge, sometimes referred to as the bridge to nowhere.
Connor Shea	[1001.770-1013.193]	That path will be about 3/4 of a mile going from the station to the stadium, and then the same distance going back after a soccer game or other event at the venue.
Connor Shea	[1014.652-1020.112]	As a neighborhood, we intend to push for a North Bridge to the site connecting the station and stadium as directly as possible.
Connor Shea	[1020.740-1027.457]	And I'm here to ask for RTD's cooperation on this, since a bridge would require the use of RTD land on the Broadway Station.
Connor Shea	[1029.778-1039.567]	North Bridge has been in most past plans for development of the site but is considered optional as part of the non-binding agreement between the city and the stadium owners that city council passed a few weeks ago.
Connor Shea	[1041.093-1048.419]	The North Bridge connection would mean only one quarter mile of walking to go from the RTD station to the stadium.
Connor Shea	[1049.947-1059.037]	In total, the bridge would-- a North Bridge would save a full mile of walking, about 20 minutes, when going to the stadium and then back after an event ends.
Connor Shea	[1059.713-1067.757]	We believe that the shorter distance with the North Pedestrian Bridge would encourage significantly more transit usage when going to events at the stadium.
Connor Shea	[1068.029-1073.745]	The Broadway Station is accessible from the D, E, and H lines without a transfer, and all other lines with only one transfer.
Connor Shea	[1074.819-1077.104]	It's also accessible from a variety of bus routes.
Connor Shea	[1077.390-1082.246]	That would reduce traffic and emissions coming through our neighborhood and the other neighborhoods adjacent to the stadium.
Connor Shea	[1084.553-1098.626]	North Bridge would be good for our neighborhood, for the safety of pedestrians and transit users, as they won't have to cross as many streets when accessing the stadium, and would be good for RTD and extra fares and customers from events at the stadium.
Connor Shea	[1099.687-1103.080]	The extra bridge would provide better connections and redundancy for pedestrians.
Connor Shea	[1103.420-1106.474]	It would especially improve accessibility for folks with limited mobility.
Connor Shea	[1108.455-1117.899]	I'm here to ask for RTD's cooperation and support on getting this included in the stadium project, as we work on negotiating a community benefits agreement with the developer over the next few months.
Connor Shea	[1119.378-1129.322]	I sent an email to the Board and CEO Johnson about this on Friday and would be happy to receive any emails from the Board or CEO if anyone has any further questions about that.
Connor Shea	[1130.255-1131.062]	Thank you very much for your time.
Julien Bouquet	[1132.258-1133.025]	Thank you for your comments, sir.
Julien Bouquet	[1134.681-1137.546]	I will now move to online participants, Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[1137.866-1140.110]	Kroll, does anyone have their virtual hand raised?
Jack Kroll	[1141.203-1141.203]	Yes.
Jack Kroll	[1141.419-1144.011]	At this time, we have a number of folks with their hands raised.
Jack Kroll	[1144.647-1147.468]	The first is former RTD Director Claudia Folska.
Julien Bouquet	[1150.594-1150.594]	Ms.
Julien Bouquet	[1150.754-1150.754]	Folska.
Jack Kroll	[1161.627-1161.847]	So, Ms.
Jack Kroll	[1162.128-1165.454]	Folska, it looks like you briefly came off mute and then went right back on.
Jack Kroll	[1166.792-1167.356]	You are unmuted.
Claudia Folska	[1167.961-1169.371]	Whew.
Claudia Folska	[1169.371-1171.184]	This is a huge achievement, guys.
Claudia Folska	[1172.742-1173.332]	Oh, God.
Claudia Folska	[1174.564-1179.183]	I was so thrilled to hear the earlier special session.
Claudia Folska	[1179.697-1185.343]	And kudos to all of you, especially General Manager/CEO Debra Johnson.
Claudia Folska	[1186.196-1187.848]	What a great accomplishment.
Claudia Folska	[1188.538-1190.167]	Lisa Kaufman, Diane.
Claudia Folska	[1191.782-1194.356]	And now I'm forgetting her last name.
Claudia Folska	[1194.785-1197.359]	But I mean, everybody was really amazing.
Claudia Folska	[1197.768-1214.843]	I would ask the Chair to afford me a little bit more time, as it's customary for former Directors to be granted additional time as they have institutional knowledge to share and inform the Board.
Claudia Folska	[1215.746-1217.067]	Would that be OK with you, Mr.
Claudia Folska	[1217.287-1217.287]	Chair?
Julien Bouquet	[1218.188-1218.438]	Of course.
Claudia Folska	[1219.529-1220.100]	Thank you very much.
Claudia Folska	[1220.310-1222.339]	I appreciate that.
Claudia Folska	[1223.992-1241.873]	So I was reflecting on my early days on the Board, and we were desperately trying to find the money to do the R line, which goes through district B and F, I think.
Claudia Folska	[1242.435-1243.146]	I don't remember.
Claudia Folska	[1243.502-1250.983]	But anyway, and Phil Washington was our Executive Director then, and he had this brilliant motto.
Claudia Folska	[1251.954-1258.669]	He always said, every day, practically, we will build as much as we can as fast as we can, no matter what.
Claudia Folska	[1259.650-1267.633]	But when it came time to find the money for the R line, he would pick up any nickel under any rock.
Claudia Folska	[1268.064-1268.965]	And you can ask him that.
Claudia Folska	[1269.946-1271.019]	And those are his words.
Claudia Folska	[1271.307-1281.354]	And he opened up a meeting, a luncheon for all business leaders, small and large, to figure out, this is what we have to work with.
Claudia Folska	[1281.977-1282.697]	How can we do it?
Claudia Folska	[1283.578-1287.487]	And it took a series of IGAs to get this thing done.
Claudia Folska	[1288.342-1288.729]	Lots of them.
Claudia Folska	[1288.983-1291.038]	So we're on the way, we're moving along.
Claudia Folska	[1291.385-1291.986]	Everything is great.
Claudia Folska	[1293.047-1302.420]	And then Bruce Benson, who was the president of the University of Colorado, comes over to the Board and says, hey, hey.
Claudia Folska	[1303.663-1303.663]	No, no, no.
Claudia Folska	[1304.077-1313.609]	We need you to change the alignment of the R line and take it off of Montview Boulevard, right through Anschutz Medical Center campus.
Claudia Folska	[1314.188-1317.186]	Now, you can imagine-- we're like, what?
Claudia Folska	[1317.714-1322.929]	How is this-- I mean, this was a huge shock, blow to all of us.
Claudia Folska	[1323.623-1324.757]	And what were we going to do?
Claudia Folska	[1324.966-1326.468]	Well, you know what that means?
Claudia Folska	[1327.209-1329.046]	It requires 10 votes.
Claudia Folska	[1329.659-1330.884]	A super majority.
Claudia Folska	[1331.536-1332.337]	And guess what?
Claudia Folska	[1333.299-1336.887]	Those folks in Longmont, in the north, they weren't having it.
Claudia Folska	[1337.947-1339.715]	They were not going to do it.
Claudia Folska	[1339.990-1353.742]	But it required all of us, each and every one of us, to have those one on one discussions and promise, promise the people in the north, let's just get this one thing done and then we can move on to the north.
Claudia Folska	[1354.927-1356.218]	Now it's their turn.
Claudia Folska	[1357.210-1361.134]	Now it's time to finish the Northwest Rail.
Claudia Folska	[1361.675-1365.274]	And those numbers, the finances and all of that, they'll come out.
Claudia Folska	[1366.041-1367.126]	You guys will figure it out.
Claudia Folska	[1367.904-1368.971]	Everybody is coming together.
Claudia Folska	[1369.346-1379.270]	All those different entities, and then IGA is so critical to proceed and move forward and do what the voters elected to have done.
Claudia Folska	[1380.182-1381.987]	FasTracks, they elected you to finish it.
Claudia Folska	[1382.726-1385.196]	You may not even like it, but it's not you.
Claudia Folska	[1385.510-1387.467]	It's the people that voted for it.
Claudia Folska	[1387.973-1389.881]	It's the RTD's obligation.
Claudia Folska	[1391.645-1402.859]	And by the way, of the 3.1 million people living in the district, 97% of them don't even use RTD and they're paying for that train.
Claudia Folska	[1403.845-1412.712]	And now you have this wonderful, exciting, incredible opportunity to finish it and even connect beyond the district into Fort Collins.
Claudia Folska	[1413.215-1417.711]	What a boon for everybody and for the entire state, quite frankly.
Claudia Folska	[1418.681-1424.212]	So I'm like, you can probably tell I'm so excited and proud of you guys.
Claudia Folska	[1424.868-1425.789]	It's like, whew.
Claudia Folska	[1426.249-1426.710]	About time.
Claudia Folska	[1428.263-1433.385]	Now, the other topic that's on my mind is Access-on-Demand.
Claudia Folska	[1436.235-1439.892]	Your annual operating budget is $1.32 billion.
Claudia Folska	[1441.242-1460.711]	And if you're thinking about equity and 20% of the population, roughly, a little more, little less, are people with disabilities, then 20% of that operating budget is closer to $264 million, and Access-on-Demand isn't anywhere close to that.
Claudia Folska	[1462.056-1470.487]	I don't think either one of these recommendations to the Board makes sense at all, and I would encourage you to look at it again.
Claudia Folska	[1470.913-1477.836]	I mean, the numbers keep changing, by the way, for the subsidies, $16 to now $22 for Access-on-Demand.
Claudia Folska	[1479.050-1480.768]	Now it's 100 for Access-a-Ride.
Claudia Folska	[1482.639-1493.412]	And why not think-- like, Einstein said you can get from point A to B with logic, but you can get everywhere with your imagination.
Claudia Folska	[1494.110-1501.002]	What if you applied the Access-on-Demand model to Access-a-Ride using those vehicles?
Claudia Folska	[1501.962-1505.028]	You could start with a little pilot and see how it worked.
Claudia Folska	[1505.908-1507.873]	You could even use it to pick up other people.
Claudia Folska	[1508.492-1518.488]	There's no prohibition from other people using those paratransit vehicles, and most of the time they're sitting in a parking lot with a driver sleeping.
Claudia Folska	[1519.675-1521.421]	So of course, I haven't seen that.
But I've been told-- Julien Bouquet	[1521.713-1525.779]	Former Director Folska, if you could wrap up your comments.
But I've been told-- Julien Bouquet	[1526.034-1527.567]	You're about double the time right now.
Claudia Folska	[1528.344-1528.624]	OK.
Claudia Folska	[1528.624-1529.185]	I appreciate it.
Claudia Folska	[1529.545-1529.725]	Thank you.
Claudia Folska	[1529.925-1531.156]	I think that's it.
Claudia Folska	[1531.647-1534.528]	So I would encourage you, sign the IGA.
Claudia Folska	[1534.940-1536.175]	Go forward with that.
Claudia Folska	[1536.586-1537.821]	Vote yes on it.
Claudia Folska	[1538.233-1545.230]	And ask staff to go back and start using their imagination for better Access-on-Demand for everybody.
Claudia Folska	[1545.722-1546.889]	Thank you very much for your time.
Julien Bouquet	[1548.160-1549.364]	Thank you, Former Director Folska.
Julien Bouquet	[1550.006-1550.006]	Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[1550.291-1551.145]	Kroll, our next participant.
Jack Kroll	[1551.892-1554.736]	Yes. next We have Former Director Doug Tisdale.
Julien Bouquet	[1555.584-1556.659]	Former Director Tisdale.
Julien Bouquet	[1557.197-1557.734]	You're recognized.
Doug Tisdale	[1560.901-1561.682]	Thank you very much.
Doug Tisdale	[1562.102-1566.138]	I appreciate the opportunity to visit with you this evening.
Doug Tisdale	[1566.606-1571.477]	I am Doug Tisdale, Former Director for District H.
Doug Tisdale	[1572.086-1580.337]	And I apologize, you're only seeing a picture of me instead of my face in person, but I guess that's the restriction.
Doug Tisdale	[1580.693-1584.225]	In any event, I'll try to keep this within the time constraints.
Doug Tisdale	[1586.284-1589.665]	The comment was made during public participation earlier.
Doug Tisdale	[1590.584-1593.972]	Highlands Ranch has access to rail.
Doug Tisdale	[1595.991-1608.309]	At the risk of being struck by lightning for contesting the testimony of a Reverend, Highlands Ranch does not have access to rail.
Doug Tisdale	[1609.770-1618.522]	The Southwest rail extension, what I affectionately refer to as the SWRE is one of the unfinished corridors of FasTracks.
Doug Tisdale	[1619.795-1629.767]	My successor, as District H Director, made a reference to that in the special meeting earlier today, many hours ago.
Doug Tisdale	[1630.933-1644.260]	The legislature, at the urging of the governor, only prioritize service for the Northwest Rail, with no reference to the Southwest Rail extension, the SWRE.
Doug Tisdale	[1645.476-1652.944]	I must confess that I must have been an inadequate voice on behalf of the SWRE.
Doug Tisdale	[1654.223-1665.408]	I apologize to my former constituents, and can only hope that my successor, as Vice Chair of this Board, will be more impactful.
Doug Tisdale	[1666.697-1674.224]	That said, kudos to all of you for proceeding with the steps toward Northwest Rail completion.
Doug Tisdale	[1675.427-1685.688]	I can only hope that we find the political will, the political courage to address the SWRE with the same kind of passion.
Doug Tisdale	[1686.991-1688.392]	Thank you very much, Mr.
Doug Tisdale	[1688.743-1688.743]	Chairman.
Julien Bouquet	[1689.434-1691.657]	Thank you, Former Director Tisdale Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[1691.932-1692.483]	Kroll, our next speaker.
Jack Kroll	[1696.883-1696.883]	Yes.
Jack Kroll	[1697.657-1700.755]	Next we have Maitri Lazaroff.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1700.755-1701.589]	Hello.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1702.482-1707.787]	I'm Maitri Lazaroff, and I am not here to talk about Northwest Rail.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1709.210-1713.775]	I am an RTD rider, and I was formerly a regular rider of the E line.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1713.775-1723.860]	And the reason I say former is, like many other riders, I was pushed off the light rail a year ago due to the fact that I could no longer rely on it as reliable transportation.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1724.448-1729.329]	And now that issue that caused me to be pushed off of the train is solved.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1729.634-1732.205]	And I know there's already been a little bit of outreach on this.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1732.439-1740.635]	There's an article on your website, but it is my opinion that RTD needs to be as loud as possible with this.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1742.677-1756.487]	It's a sad fact that the majority of people in the metro don't ride transit, and we need to yell to get news like this out, because it's hard for it to spread with light announcements and word of mouth.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1757.140-1765.981]	We have lost, as of 2024, 21.6% of E line riders and 31.4% of H line riders.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1767.254-1777.612]	And not only is that a massive hit to the light rail system, but it bleeds to the rest of the system by people not being able to make those transfers.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1777.977-1781.862]	We saw ridership decreases on all three of our rail lines last year.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1783.178-1787.725]	And it's just, Directors making Reddit posts just really isn't enough.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1790.462-1804.727]	Could we maybe give two weeks of free fares to try and really get eyes back on the system to try and really make an effort to undo this ridership destruction that we've seen on our light rail?
Maitri Lazaroff	[1805.067-1806.765]	And especially on the Southeast corridor.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1808.020-1808.193]	Thank you.
Maitri Lazaroff	[1808.407-1809.021]	That's my time.
Julien Bouquet	[1810.349-1810.803]	Thank you, Maitri.
Julien Bouquet	[1811.530-1811.530]	Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[1811.810-1812.652]	Kroll, our next speaker.
Jack Kroll	[1813.672-1813.672]	Yes.
Jack Kroll	[1814.046-1815.542]	Next, we have Richard Bamber.
Julien Bouquet	[1817.239-1817.813]	Richard, you're recognized.
Richard Bamber	[1820.665-1824.618]	Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.
Richard Bamber	[1825.033-1830.847]	I'd like to talk about the Title VI changes, which are up for approval tonight.
Richard Bamber	[1832.138-1844.141]	GBT is generally in support of these changes, although we know a yes vote, needs to be carried out against the backdrop that a review of the methodology is needed in the medium term.
Richard Bamber	[1844.485-1852.504]	Currently, RTD's only reliable data source uses Census data about what sort of populations demographics live in certain neighborhoods.
Richard Bamber	[1853.648-1867.394]	So we make lots of effort to ensure service outside the front doors of equity populations is sufficiently good that they're not left behind when service is improved and they're not unfairly targeted when service has to be cut.
Richard Bamber	[1868.648-1873.957]	However, this approach only assumes equity populations only travel locally within the communities they reside.
Richard Bamber	[1875.158-1880.283]	A good transit network can level up communities and spread wealth across its entire metro area.
Richard Bamber	[1881.026-1896.091]	There's no point in running 15 minute frequency buses past the doorsteps of a low income or BIPOC community if they then have to transfer onto another bus which runs every 60 minutes and drops you a mile away from that well-paying employer.
Richard Bamber	[1897.372-1910.964]	The current Title VI process fails to consider how a local transit network either succeeds or fails to service equity populations effectively, and it is because it considers the routes basically in silos.
Richard Bamber	[1911.788-1926.196]	And this is why, while we support the Title VI, we support the agency's efforts, we believe that it could be made a much more effective process if new data sources are considered and the methodology is reviewed.
Richard Bamber	[1926.565-1928.079]	Thank you very much for letting me speak tonight.
Julien Bouquet	[1929.350-1930.603]	Thank you for your comments, Richard.
Julien Bouquet	[1930.873-1931.667]	Our next speaker, Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[1931.931-1931.931]	Kroll?
Jack Kroll	[1932.216-1934.169]	Yes, next is Jo Elizabeth Pinto.
Julien Bouquet	[1935.823-1940.873]	Jo, you are recognized.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1942.796-1943.464]	Am I unmuted?
Jack Kroll	[1944.419-1945.216]	We hear you, Jo.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1945.501-1945.711]	Thank you.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1946.642-1950.716]	I would like to talk quickly about two issues.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1951.349-1954.571]	The first is the Rockies Ride.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1955.275-1971.748]	My family went to the Rockies game last week, and we looked up how to get there on the RTD website, and there's a whole page dedicated to the Rockies Ride.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1973.222-1981.944]	But when we got to the stop, there were no buses, no people, no cars, no nothing.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1982.855-1994.236]	So we called the RTD, 299-6000, and the woman laughed and said, oh, we haven't had those buses for years.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[1995.854-2021.358]	So the RTD needs to take down the Rockies Ride info from its website if it is no longer running those services, and it needs to keep its website updated about the services that are provided because people depend on that website to be accurate.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2023.630-2029.505]	The other thing that I need to talk about is Access-on-Demand.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2031.328-2055.618]	And my issue is that when you look at the Access-on-Demand and when you are talking about cutting services-- which, again, if we are 20% to 25% of the population that have disabilities, a little more, a little less, like Ms.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2056.158-2089.519]	Folska said, the idea to cut services based on the RTD schedule will leave people with no services on the weekends if the bus doesn't run on weekends to that part of the service area, or at night, or if they live more than 3/4 of a mile from a bus stop.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2090.051-2092.711]	And that will leave people stranded.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2094.826-2100.470]	And people with disabilities go places after 5 o'clock.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2101.735-2103.388]	They go places on the weekends.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2104.099-2104.099]	They go places.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2104.099-2110.983]	They don't just go to doctors that are open in the daytime.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2111.649-2118.069]	They go to shows, they go to restaurants, they go to malls on the weekends.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2118.778-2121.757]	They go all the same places you do.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2122.163-2130.995]	And it becomes really difficult when they get stranded in their homes except from 9:00 to 5:00, weekdays.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2132.316-2153.895]	So just take that into consideration when you make these cuts and imagine people who are disabled going to the same places you do, and imagine being stranded at home because you cut so that they can only go from 9:00 to 5:00 on weekdays.
Also-- Julien Bouquet	[2155.746-2158.447]	Jo, if you could wrap up your comments.
Also-- Julien Bouquet	[2158.785-2160.135]	You're about 10 seconds over.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2160.493-2160.493]	OK.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2160.493-2160.684]	Thank you.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2161.334-2170.063]	The other thing is remember that these people with disabilities pay taxes to RTD the same way you do.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2170.568-2171.059]	Thank you.
Jo Elizabeth Pinto	[2171.570-2172.788]	That's all I have to say.
Julien Bouquet	[2173.092-2174.194]	Thank you for your comments, Jo.
Julien Bouquet	[2175.055-2175.752]	Our next speaker, Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[2175.985-2175.985]	Kroll?
Jack Kroll	[2176.670-2176.670]	Yes.
Jack Kroll	[2177.057-2178.606]	Next we have Tim Keenan.
Julien Bouquet	[2179.841-2180.406]	Tim, you're recognized.
Jack Kroll	[2194.135-2194.950]	Tim?
Looks like-- Tim Keenan	[2194.950-2196.254]	Can you hear me now?
Julien Bouquet	[2196.819-2197.470]	We can hear you, Tim.
Julien Bouquet	[2197.620-2197.800]	Thank you.
Tim Keenan	[2198.601-2199.843]	Alrighty.
Tim Keenan	[2199.843-2200.684]	I'm Tim Keenan.
Tim Keenan	[2201.145-2201.692]	Thanks for listening.
Tim Keenan	[2202.767-2206.657]	I am a totally blind user of Access-a-Ride.
Tim Keenan	[2207.253-2207.753]	I'm sorry.
Tim Keenan	[2208.274-2210.934]	Of Access-- I'm not sure if you caught the beginning of that.
Tim Keenan	[2211.138-2211.525]	I'm Tim Keenan.
Tim Keenan	[2211.739-2224.241]	I'm a totally blind user of Access-on-Demand, and I live in Baker and work a fluctuating schedule out at Amazon in Aurora, which includes night and overnight shifts.
Tim Keenan	[2224.852-2236.681]	So if you were to follow any of these recommendations, me and people like me, because I know there are a lot of people with disabilities who work out there, would not be able to use Access-on-Demand for at least one leg of their trip.
Tim Keenan	[2238.112-2242.018]	In my case, that would eat into my paycheck by close to a third.
Tim Keenan	[2243.592-2252.713]	And when you look at the numbers here, Access-on-Demand is probably the most efficient of your services.
Tim Keenan	[2253.133-2259.862]	With fixed routes costing $19 per boarding, Access-on-Demand at $16 and Access-a-Ride at $60.
Tim Keenan	[2261.345-2271.688]	So this is really working well, and to cut it, I think you need to decide whether this is in fact sustainable.
Tim Keenan	[2272.199-2278.906]	I know there was-- the use was just blowing up and people got worried, and so they commissioned this review and all that.
Tim Keenan	[2279.689-2290.473]	But really, it's helping a lot of people, and at 1.13% of your annual budget, it sounds pretty sustainable to me.
Tim Keenan	[2290.844-2301.035]	Now, all that said, I don't know anyone who wouldn't-- I don't know anybody who would be against paying a fare.
Tim Keenan	[2301.485-2315.452]	So if you add a $4.50 fare and that's $2.8 million of savings from the current numbers.
Tim Keenan	[2320.888-2323.232]	That's doing something to put more money back into the system.
Tim Keenan	[2324.214-2326.475]	And we certainly don't mind paying our way.
Tim Keenan	[2328.200-2340.663]	But to cut the area in hours is going to leave some people who don't even have bus service in their area anymore, but used to, it's going to leave those people totally stranded without any kind of affordable transit option.
Tim Keenan	[2342.583-2349.297]	So my ask would be that you keep the limit at 60 trips a month.
Tim Keenan	[2349.652-2355.757]	This allows full time workers, 40 trips, and then 20 trips to do whatever they want or need to do.
Tim Keenan	[2356.096-2358.131]	Get groceries and participate in the community.
Tim Keenan	[2360.895-2383.662]	Maintain the current service area and hours so you're not creating transit deserts, and implement pricing that's fair that stays constant at $4.50 or $2.25 for RTD live that doesn't punish people for taking more trips like a tiered system would do, and it also doesn't have the added overhead that that system would have.
Tim Keenan	[2384.810-2399.877]	So basically you can keep the program as it is now, add a fare, and keep this program doing what it does best, which is connect people with disabilities with their community.
Julien Bouquet	[2400.178-2401.096]	Tim, if you could wrap up your comments.
Tim Keenan	[2402.121-2402.332]	All set.
Tim Keenan	[2402.582-2403.033]	Thank you very much.
Julien Bouquet	[2403.944-2404.745]	Thank you for your comments, Tim.
Julien Bouquet	[2405.326-2408.312]	For the sake of the record, I'd like to note that Director Ruscha has joined us.
Julien Bouquet	[2409.793-2410.502]	Our next speaker, Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[2410.739-2410.739]	Kroll.
Jack Kroll	[2410.739-2411.376]	Yes.
Jack Kroll	[2411.650-2412.745]	Next we have Nate Trela.
Julien Bouquet	[2413.860-2414.434]	Nate, you're recognized.
Nate Trela	[2419.830-2419.830]	Yeah.
Nate Trela	[2419.830-2419.830]	Hi.
Nate Trela	[2420.054-2420.728]	This is Nate Trela.
Nate Trela	[2420.992-2423.075]	Thank you once again for the chance to speak.
Nate Trela	[2424.698-2443.258]	Hopefully we're down the home stretch here in terms of finding a sustainable path forward for Access-on-Demand that still maintains this robust level of service and utility for the district residents that cannot use a fixed route service independently.
Nate Trela	[2444.662-2456.445]	I implore you to recognize a few facts that are in the staff's presentation that you're going to-- the public's going to hear tonight and that was in the agenda packet for this meeting and for the operations meeting a couple weeks ago.
Nate Trela	[2457.440-2467.624]	And there's some unanswered questions that you may already have as Board members, information that you should definitely, in my opinion, make sure as you're making decisions about the future of this program.
Nate Trela	[2468.736-2481.719]	In the agenda packet, it already talks about how the cost of an Access trip is just a fraction of the cost of a traditional access ride service.
Nate Trela	[2482.986-2506.092]	And I don't know if there has been any effort made to see if it's possible to try to encourage people to use Access-on-Demand instead of Access-a-Ride, if people are fully aware of the capabilities of it, if people are aware of how to use it, converting a few of those access ride trips to Access-on-Demand could yield significant savings in this whole process.
Nate Trela	[2507.437-2515.603]	Also, it's worth pointing out that you're more than doubling the number of trips provided to people who cannot use fixed route service with Access-on-Demand, as opposed to Access-a-Ride.
Nate Trela	[2516.150-2516.671]	That's a success.
Nate Trela	[2517.532-2523.540]	You're helping people make connections, get around, participate in the workforce, participate in society.
Nate Trela	[2524.703-2531.539]	As we've heard people talk about, shop, go out and get some entertainment, whether it's movies or music or what have you.
Nate Trela	[2531.836-2533.620]	Things have become possible with this program.
Nate Trela	[2534.588-2543.873]	Some of the answered questions in these proposals is in the tiered fare concept, it talks about needing to hire additional staff.
Nate Trela	[2544.467-2548.251]	Perhaps this is already going to be discussed later tonight, but it's not clear what that staff would do.
Nate Trela	[2549.216-2566.855]	And it's hard to fathom what would need to be added to-- what would need to be handled by added staff that couldn't be automated, couldn't be handled with a spreadsheet wizard and a knowledge of how to write some stuff in SQL.
Nate Trela	[2568.325-2577.675]	There are ways to gather a lot of different data and process a lot of numbers, analyze the numbers to make that tiered fare approach work.
Nate Trela	[2578.101-2581.725]	So it'd be good to know what those new hires would need to do.
Nate Trela	[2582.429-2588.716]	Both proposals call for cutting back, as we've talked about, the service area hours back to match Access-a-Ride.
Nate Trela	[2591.337-2593.793]	This isn't required as a supplemental premium service.
Nate Trela	[2594.144-2597.301]	Access-on-Demand doesn't have to line up with Access-a-Ride.
Nate Trela	[2598.023-2598.924]	That is a choice that's made.
Nate Trela	[2601.106-2614.971]	What's the question is, how would Access-a-Ride enforce the restricted hours proposed and contained both these plans because when the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado has spoken with RTD staff before, we've been told that, yes, geofencing to define the boundaries can be done.
Julien Bouquet	[2615.232-2617.294]	Nate, if you could wrap up your comments.
Nate Trela	[2617.978-2617.978]	Sure.
Nate Trela	[2617.978-2617.978]	Sure.
Nate Trela	[2619.040-2631.503]	Just saying that the cutback of the hours is going to be incredibly complex to manage, and it's unclear how you could expect somebody to do that, especially when, again, the point of RTD is to be helping people make connections.
Nate Trela	[2632.137-2634.904]	Adding these layers of complexity to it does the exact opposite.
Julien Bouquet	[2636.763-2637.110]	Thank you, Nate.
Julien Bouquet	[2638.105-2638.742]	Our next speaker, Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[2638.954-2638.954]	Kroll.
Jack Kroll	[2639.298-2639.298]	Yes.
Jack Kroll	[2639.618-2640.900]	Next we have Cody Bair.
Julien Bouquet	[2642.103-2642.690]	Cody, you're recognized.
Cody Bair	[2646.470-2648.050]	Good evening and thank you RTD Board.
Cody Bair	[2648.353-2659.654]	I am also here to talk about Access-a-Ride-- Access-on-Demand service, and have spoken about the topic at a few meetings before.
Cody Bair	[2660.577-2666.504]	Tonight I want to say that I agree with you what Dr.
Cody Bair	[2666.998-2670.949]	Folska and Tim Keenan said about this.
Cody Bair	[2671.443-2676.382]	Access-on-Demand cost is really a fraction of RTD's budget.
Cody Bair	[2676.876-2701.402]	At just 1.13% and just north of, I think $10 million, this is not a huge opportunity for RTD to save significantly on the budget and would be a huge loss of service for many Coloradoans in the RTD district with disabilities.
Cody Bair	[2702.326-2705.920]	Speaking to the current proposals that are out there.
Cody Bair	[2706.369-2720.746]	With the tiered proposal, one thing that I would urge the RTD Board to think about and questions to ask would be, how would we actually enforce the fares of the tiered proposal?
Cody Bair	[2721.255-2733.145]	This service is offered amongst Uber, Lyft, and a couple of other taxi platforms, neither of which share information or communicate with each other at all.
Cody Bair	[2733.769-2749.689]	To that point, even in the current system as a user, if I want to see how many trips I've used, I have to open each platform and count the number that have been taken in the month on that platform.
Cody Bair	[2750.403-2766.005]	I just don't see an administratively effective way to make the fare thing work without putting that burden on the rider, which would inherently cause issues for people keeping track of it.
Cody Bair	[2767.489-2772.582]	Second, to follow up on Nate's comments about the hours.
Cody Bair	[2773.148-2791.188]	You look at somebody who's a full time employee at Amazon like Tim and many others who would be affected by this, that's taking-- by cutting people's ability to use the service, we're taking tax revenue out of the Colorado economy.
Cody Bair	[2791.636-2796.306]	I'm not sure that that's something that makes a lot of sense for RTD.
Cody Bair	[2796.665-2815.453]	And people have built their lives around being able to access this service in its current state and any reduction and change of the service area or hours is a reduction in service, in my mind, and something that I would completely be against.
Cody Bair	[2816.164-2819.930]	Appreciate your guys' time tonight, and that concludes my comments.
Julien Bouquet	[2821.410-2822.328]	Thank you for your comments, Cody.
Julien Bouquet	[2822.871-2822.871]	Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[2823.127-2823.638]	Kroll, our next speaker.
Jack Kroll	[2824.273-2824.273]	Yes.
Jack Kroll	[2824.713-2827.517]	The last speaker we have in the queue is Maryann Migliorelli.
Julien Bouquet	[2828.798-2829.729]	Maryann, you're recognized.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2832.955-2834.141]	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2834.678-2836.913]	Thank you so much for your time and your attention.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2837.983-2850.658]	Tonight I would like to speak to you briefly about equity and the Access-on-Demand system and in RTD in general.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2852.364-2864.428]	We have been told by RTD members that we cannot have the multiple stop situation because that would not be equitable.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2865.558-2869.950]	We have been told that we can have certain things, but we can't have others.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2871.345-2879.659]	One of the things that we are now being told is that with this tiered system, we can have inequity in pricing.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2880.656-2887.515]	There is no place in the RTD system where riding more costs more per trip.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2888.829-2890.603]	This does not happen on Access-a-Ride.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2891.318-2899.216]	It does not happen anywhere in the fixed route system, on any light rail, on any bus.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2899.730-2908.543]	As a matter of fact, RTD went out of its way to remove the barriers to regional transit by removing the price barrier.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2909.384-2923.883]	But with the ideas of this tiered system, we are saying-- and you would be saying if you approve it-- that anybody who does more than 30 trips per month should have to pay more in order to use a system.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2924.890-2927.043]	That, ladies and gentlemen, is inequity.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2928.074-2933.299]	And that is not something that RTD should even have been entertaining that proposal.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2934.462-2942.020]	But you will do what is necessary, and I will thank you for the hard work that is involved in keeping our program alive.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2943.875-2969.044]	The other thought is in removing and putting the boundaries in that are the same for Access-a-Ride, there are many people who will be affected whose life plans, the places they live, the places they work, the places they choose to do business and entertain will all be affected.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2970.993-2986.890]	People have been provided a service, have been able to make these decisions about their lives because of the service that is provided, and taking service away creates further inequity and transit deficits.
Maryann Migliorelli	[2988.348-3002.947]	That is not something RTD should be looking for doing, and I sincerely hope that in every way that you can, you find a way to keep the Access-on-Demand program as open as it is right now.
Maryann Migliorelli	[3003.691-3011.792]	I personally do not know anybody who would object to paying the 4.50 or 2.25 fare as proposed.
Maryann Migliorelli	[3012.268-3019.416]	But adding additional fares and cutting service will make transit deficits that should not be considered.
Maryann Migliorelli	[3020.213-3029.957]	Right now, this program is moving people who have never had a chance to participate in public transit life in the way that we can right now.
Maryann Migliorelli	[3030.871-3033.165]	Please consider this when you're making your decisions.
Maryann Migliorelli	[3033.914-3040.535]	Thank you so much for your time and those who remember me before, if I was there, I would bring you warm chocolate cookies.
Julien Bouquet	[3042.541-3043.942]	Thank you for your comments, Maryann.
Julien Bouquet	[3045.384-3049.127]	Are there any members of the public who would like to-- excuse me.
Julien Bouquet	[3049.467-3049.467]	Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[3049.808-3051.169]	Kroll, any further online participants?
Jack Kroll	[3052.189-3053.600]	No further online participants.
Julien Bouquet	[3054.091-3058.101]	Any members of the public who would like to make comments?
Julien Bouquet	[3058.355-3060.139]	Feel free to come up to the podium.
Julien Bouquet	[3063.879-3065.734]	Seeing none, were there any emailed comments, Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[3065.988-3065.988]	Kroll?
Jack Kroll	[3066.423-3066.949]	There were a number.
Jack Kroll	[3067.144-3070.084]	I am not going to go through all 46 and read the names.
Jack Kroll	[3070.509-3089.239]	However, you received 36 letters with respect to Northwest Rail and the IGA conversation that you held earlier today, five letters with respect to the ETOD policy you will consider later this evening, three letters with respect to Title VI policy or the program update that you all will consider later this evening.
Jack Kroll	[3090.268-3100.289]	One regarding the National Women's Soccer League proposed stadium that was discussed earlier here in person, and one regarding paratransit AOD program modifications.
Jack Kroll	[3101.346-3103.618]	All will be appended to the transcript of this meeting.
Jack Kroll	[3104.170-3116.478]	And just as a reminder to Directors, a majority of these written public comment comments were submitted to the rtd.directors email group, which you all have access to and can see in real time.
Julien Bouquet	[3117.732-3118.183]	Thank you, Mr.
Julien Bouquet	[3118.409-3118.409]	Kroll.
Julien Bouquet	[3118.934-3122.711]	With no other participants in the queue, we will now close public participation at this time.
Julien Bouquet	[3124.203-3126.802]	Moving on to our next item, external entities report.
Julien Bouquet	[3127.147-3130.197]	We have no external entity reports this month.
Julien Bouquet	[3131.812-3133.151]	Moving on to our next item.
Julien Bouquet	[3133.418-3133.686]	Discussion items.
Julien Bouquet	[3134.354-3141.669]	We have one discussion item on the agenda this evening, which is a holdover from last week's Operation Safety and Security Committee meeting.
Julien Bouquet	[3142.021-3144.509]	It is the Access-on-Demand program modifications.
Julien Bouquet	[3145.565-3151.104]	I would like to offer the floor to GM/CEO Debra Johnson for some opening remarks before introducing Ms.
Julien Bouquet	[3151.750-3151.750]	Vallejos.
Debra Johnson	[3153.632-3154.659]	Thank you very much, Mr.
Debra Johnson	[3154.916-3154.916]	Chair.
Debra Johnson	[3155.654-3157.355]	Good afternoon or evening, Board members.
Debra Johnson	[3157.696-3160.078]	Debra Johnson, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer.
Debra Johnson	[3161.073-3168.966]	I am joined by Erin Vallejos, who serves as the Acting Assistant or Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations.
Debra Johnson	[3169.885-3185.515]	And as indicated in your remarks, sir, we are here referencing the previous agendized topic at the Operations Safety and Security Committee that we did not get to and wanted to have this conversation with you all this evening.
Debra Johnson	[3186.095-3194.211]	The intent of this presentation is to ground all Board members in our paratransit programs.
Debra Johnson	[3194.811-3212.265]	But more specifically, what we are seeking from this body is some guidance relative to Access-on-Demand, which is a supplemental premium service as it relates to paratransit services, not the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 complementary paratransit services.
Debra Johnson	[3212.693-3218.092]	And in doing so, this conversation will help us guide our path forward.
Debra Johnson	[3219.603-3229.472]	Specifically, I think what's notable for everybody to understand that the current paratransit contracts that we have for Access-on-Demand do sunset at the end of December.
Debra Johnson	[3230.399-3232.821]	We have had conversations relative to modifications.
Debra Johnson	[3233.225-3243.997]	In absence of having some guidance, we run the risk of not having any type of services, and hence why it's so imperative is that we adhere to open and fair competition.
Debra Johnson	[3244.332-3255.015]	In order to do a solicitation relative to services, we have to have some guidance relative to the specifications that would be included in a solicitation for a request for proposal.
Debra Johnson	[3255.898-3268.640]	So this is not for you to make a decision relative to where we are, but provide guidance, because what we anticipate doing with said guidance and bringing forward these scenarios after meeting with some board members, i.e.
Debra Johnson	[3269.880-3284.635]	Chair Ruscha and Director Chandler, that are both on the Operation Safety and Security Committee, is to seek that direction so we can then go out to the customer segments and garner a better understanding.
Debra Johnson	[3284.980-3305.247]	While we've heard comments here, we have taken part in a myriad of different public participation engagements and want to ensure that we are being good fiscal stewards, but also ensuring that we are providing the independence and ability for all aspects of our population to be able to travel and move about to and fro.
Debra Johnson	[3305.619-3308.667]	So with that being said, I will yield the floor to Ms.
Debra Johnson	[3309.024-3311.261]	Vallejos to commence with the presentation.
Debra Johnson	[3311.748-3315.096]	If we could have Board Office staff pull that up, that would be appreciated.
Debra Johnson	[3315.574-3315.765]	Thank you.
Erin Vallejos	[3334.801-3336.360]	It's been a while since I've used these microphones.
Erin Vallejos	[3337.183-3337.730]	Good evening, everyone.
Erin Vallejos	[3338.244-3349.731]	As GM/CEO Johnson said, I'm Erin Vallejos, the Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, and we are just going to go over just a quick overview.
Erin Vallejos	[3350.056-3354.012]	I think it's a lot of information that you've already seen, so we won't spend too much time on that.
Erin Vallejos	[3354.961-3365.748]	Just kind of hit on what the initial recommendation was that we made talk about some revised recommendations, and then again, open it up for discussion to get an idea of some direction.
Julien Bouquet	[3366.593-3366.593]	Ms.
Julien Bouquet	[3366.793-3369.299]	Vallejos, before, could you speak a little closer to the microphone?
Erin Vallejos	[3369.917-3370.398]	Yes, I can.
Julien Bouquet	[3370.658-3371.109]	Thank you so much.
Erin Vallejos	[3371.279-3371.689]	Of course.
Erin Vallejos	[3372.140-3378.453]	OK, so just to highlight on this, again, as GM/CEO Johnson said.
Erin Vallejos	[3378.904-3383.864]	Access-a- Ride and Access-on-Demand are the two programs that we have.
Erin Vallejos	[3384.535-3390.444]	Access-a-Ride is RTD's federally required ADA complementary paratransit service.
Erin Vallejos	[3391.163-3393.826]	It does supplement our fixed route services.
Erin Vallejos	[3394.851-3406.545]	There is a fare payment required for these services and customers must meet the criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to be eligible.
Erin Vallejos	[3406.958-3413.237]	This is provided with all RTD branded Access-a-Ride vehicles that are all 100% accessible.
Erin Vallejos	[3414.507-3418.930]	And then Access-on-Demand is our supplemental premium paratransit service.
Erin Vallejos	[3420.153-3423.594]	It is a curb-to-curb taxi and rideshare service.
Erin Vallejos	[3424.638-3434.954]	It is available to current paratransit customers, so they must meet those eligibility criteria to qualify for Access-a-Ride to then use Access-on-Demand.
Erin Vallejos	[3436.372-3442.494]	And as it stands today, RTD pays the first $25 of the trip and the remaining portion is paid by the customer.
Erin Vallejos	[3443.668-3447.160]	And again, ability today to take 60 total trips.
Erin Vallejos	[3448.336-3450.256]	So just some quick operating statistics.
Erin Vallejos	[3450.820-3458.337]	The annual operating cost in 2024 for Access-a-Ride was just over 53 million, and the customer trips were just over 500,000.
Erin Vallejos	[3458.835-3467.824]	And again, these are RTD owned vehicles, and the contractors that operate this service have over 500 drivers, mechanics, and other staff.
Erin Vallejos	[3468.232-3468.853]	And then Access-on-Demand.
Erin Vallejos	[3469.164-3473.512]	Last year it was about just over $15.3 million for the budget.
Erin Vallejos	[3476.008-3477.201]	Just over 685,000 trips.
Erin Vallejos	[3477.599-3480.780]	And these are all provided by third party vehicles.
Erin Vallejos	[3483.031-3488.359]	So again, as we touched on, you must be eligible for Access-a-Ride to also use Access-on-Demand.
Erin Vallejos	[3490.639-3499.744]	There is a process that customers must go through that determines if a customer has a disabling condition that would prevent them from using our regular fixed route service.
Erin Vallejos	[3501.050-3507.759]	There's an application process, a medical verification process, and then an in-person assessment that customers must complete.
Erin Vallejos	[3508.158-3512.269]	And there are a couple of different types of eligibility that a customer could receive.
Erin Vallejos	[3512.744-3517.920]	Unconditional means you can have access to the full service for up to four years.
Erin Vallejos	[3518.831-3518.831]	Temporary.
Erin Vallejos	[3519.154-3524.315]	You might have a condition that's going to improve, recovering from surgery or something along those lines.
Erin Vallejos	[3525.239-3535.520]	And then conditional would be when there was something-- maybe you're sensitive to extreme hot or extreme cold, so you would be able to use it at those times, but not the full year.
Erin Vallejos	[3537.537-3537.537]	OK.
Erin Vallejos	[3537.914-3543.187]	And as we have touched on, this is something that you've probably seen as well.
Erin Vallejos	[3544.324-3548.142]	We are continuing to see an increase in Access-on-Demand usage.
Erin Vallejos	[3549.030-3555.771]	This is through 2024, but we continue to see that Access- on-Demand trend line going up into the start of this year.
Erin Vallejos	[3556.097-3565.368]	And Access-a-Ride, when you look at the trend line, while it is staying a little bit more stable, we are still seeing an increase in usage there as well.
Erin Vallejos	[3567.862-3571.216]	And as we've talked about, average monthly trips per customer.
Erin Vallejos	[3571.588-3576.805]	The majority of customers are falling into the category of taking up to 50 trips.
Erin Vallejos	[3577.198-3586.653]	That is about 90% of the customers when we last did the analysis, and about 10% of the customers again fall into that 51 to 60 category.
Erin Vallejos	[3588.989-3593.957]	So now I'm going to just remind everyone of what our initial recommendations were back in 2024.
Erin Vallejos	[3594.367-3599.998]	As it stands today again, quickly, there's a $0 base customer fare.
Erin Vallejos	[3600.768-3602.613]	The trip cap is 60 per month.
Erin Vallejos	[3602.921-3604.766]	Subsidy is up to $25 per trip.
Erin Vallejos	[3606.416-3609.976]	It is available within the entire district and it is available 24/7.
Erin Vallejos	[3611.384-3625.446]	Back when we came to you in November of 2024, we had proposed making changes, and this involved having a $4.50 base customer fare, which would be $2.25 for our LiVE eligible customers.
Erin Vallejos	[3626.466-3628.781]	We proposed a trip cap of $40 per month.
Erin Vallejos	[3630.282-3637.938]	The subsidy would go to $20 per trip, and then it was proposed to mirror both the current service area and the service hours.
Erin Vallejos	[3640.233-3648.446]	With this recommendation, there were going to be cost savings that the District would realize, and that was going to be about $5.8 million.
Erin Vallejos	[3650.184-3657.831]	So instead of the projected yearly spend being a little bit over 15 million, we would go down to about 9.4.
Erin Vallejos	[3661.957-3669.140]	OK, and as a result of some of the feedback and comments that we've heard, we did put together two additional revised scenarios.
Erin Vallejos	[3669.487-3672.619]	So scenario one is what I'm going to touch on first.
Erin Vallejos	[3673.152-3676.447]	So this has to do with an increased trip cap approach.
Erin Vallejos	[3677.659-3685.643]	So what we were proposing in this scenario is increasing the trip cap to 50 per month from the original 40 that was proposed.
Erin Vallejos	[3685.970-3697.694]	We are proposing as this is, again, as we've said, a premium supplemental service, a fare of $6.50 per trip, which would be $3.25 for our LiVE customers.
Erin Vallejos	[3699.229-3701.339]	Then the remainder of the proposal does remain the same.
Erin Vallejos	[3701.713-3713.108]	We were still proposing a subsidy per trip of $20, and we are proposing mirroring the current service area and service hours as that of our Access-a-Ride program.
Erin Vallejos	[3714.303-3729.584]	With this program, we did see actually a little bit of the yearly impact would be a cost savings of about 6.1 million, bringing our total spend to about a little over 9.1.
Erin Vallejos	[3730.013-3747.122]	With the 50 trips, that does allow for customers to still have-- given there's about 20 week days in a month that does allow for customers to still travel to work, but then does allow for some ancillary trips throughout the month.
Erin Vallejos	[3749.977-3756.159]	And then another scenario that we had put together is the tiered approach that we have discussed.
Erin Vallejos	[3757.206-3764.389]	With this approach, we would still maintain a trip cap of up to 60 trips per month, which matches what we have currently.
Erin Vallejos	[3765.676-3776.593]	There would be a $4.50 base customer fare for up to 30 trips, $5.50 for 31 to 50, and $6.50 for 51 to 60.
Erin Vallejos	[3777.804-3780.874]	And the remainder of the recommendation would remain the same.
Erin Vallejos	[3782.613-3800.063]	With this program, as some people have noted, due to the program structure and some of the manual aspects that exist with monitoring today, there would be a pretty big an increase in staff oversight that would result in additional staff headcount.
Erin Vallejos	[3800.500-3806.989]	Again, that had been noted, but as it stands today, the program does require quite a bit of manual intervention.
Erin Vallejos	[3808.347-3816.088]	There is also, as someone mentioned, the customers would need to be keeping a little bit closer track of their trips, and that could lead to confusion.
Erin Vallejos	[3816.867-3822.599]	It is something a customer would have to be regularly thinking, all right, where am I at for the month?
Erin Vallejos	[3823.362-3824.551]	Have I hit that 30 trips?
Erin Vallejos	[3824.789-3826.692]	So they know what to expect for their costs.
Erin Vallejos	[3828.749-3833.298]	With this program, we would see some reductions of just over $5 million.
Erin Vallejos	[3833.757-3844.097]	So it is a little bit less than some of the other recommendations that we've put forth, and it would bring our projected yearly spend to about $10.28 million a year.
Erin Vallejos	[3848.341-3848.671]	Oh, and actually.
Erin Vallejos	[3849.860-3851.001]	So proposed next steps.
Erin Vallejos	[3851.381-3860.126]	We are here, as GM/CEO Johnson has said, to just garner everyone's feedback and get some guidance on a path forward.
Erin Vallejos	[3861.067-3867.368]	The intent is to do outreach and engagement in June based on some of that guidance and engage with the community.
Erin Vallejos	[3867.663-3878.138]	We would be coming back for Board consideration in July with an actual recommended action to the committee, and then provided the committee advanced it at the Board meeting.
Erin Vallejos	[3878.572-3883.692]	And we would begin implementation in August with full implementation in October.
Erin Vallejos	[3884.197-3887.490]	And with that, I will open it up.
Julien Bouquet	[3889.082-3889.082]	Perfect.
Julien Bouquet	[3889.982-3891.489]	Thank you very much for your presentation, Ms.
Julien Bouquet	[3891.744-3891.744]	Vallejos.
Julien Bouquet	[3893.165-3893.165]	OK.
Julien Bouquet	[3893.401-3895.051]	I'm going to open it up for Directors.
Julien Bouquet	[3895.567-3896.258]	Second Vice Chair Whitmore.
Troy Whitmore	[3896.258-3902.035]	Thank you for the presentation and the ease of absorbing the proposed changes.
Troy Whitmore	[3903.264-3915.259]	Erin, looking at the second proposal, the tiered approach, one of our commenters talked about the complications of keeping up with number of trips.
Troy Whitmore	[3916.522-3928.466]	Is that something that the new staff would be able to be a clearinghouse, if you will, to where you have one call to RTD instead of calling a taxi and a Lyft and an Uber?
Troy Whitmore	[3928.776-3931.569]	That seems to be the most difficult part of that.
Troy Whitmore	[3931.879-3938.395]	I'm just curious if you think our staff would be handling that in a way that would be handy for our customers.
Erin Vallejos	[3938.706-3947.083]	It's definitely something I think we could assist with, but I do think there would still be some burden on the customer for having some of that responsibility.
Erin Vallejos	[3948.207-3953.467]	Again, as I mentioned, as it stands today, there is just a very manual aspect of the program.
Erin Vallejos	[3954.317-3962.355]	And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.
Julien Bouquet	[3964.934-3965.255]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[3967.360-3967.360]	Director Catlin.
Peggy Catlin	[3967.360-3967.660]	Thank you.
Peggy Catlin	[3967.981-3970.014]	And thank you for a very clear presentation.
Peggy Catlin	[3970.384-3973.578]	Although I have one question of clarification.
Peggy Catlin	[3974.490-3976.891]	You talk about mirroring the existing service area.
Peggy Catlin	[3978.496-3993.036]	One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that I don't think that the customers were restricted to the 3/4 mile within a fixed route.
Peggy Catlin	[3994.225-3997.368]	Would that change with this, any of these proposals?
Peggy Catlin	[3997.755-4001.626]	Or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?
Erin Vallejos	[4002.033-4010.720]	As the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the 3/4 of a mile boundary that exists today for our Access-a-Ride customers.
Peggy Catlin	[4014.645-4020.895]	That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.
Peggy Catlin	[4021.372-4021.562]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4023.993-4023.993]	OK.
Julien Bouquet	[4023.993-4024.524]	Secretary Nicholson.
Chris Nicholson	[4024.524-4028.153]	Thank you very much.
Chris Nicholson	[4028.805-4035.567]	I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.
Chris Nicholson	[4037.407-4043.146]	We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.
Chris Nicholson	[4044.508-4055.680]	They're our commuter routes, and I would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within 3/4 of a mile of those routes.
Chris Nicholson	[4056.126-4062.318]	So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.
Chris Nicholson	[4062.596-4068.258]	Otherwise Peggy has two places in her district that get service, and that's just not reasonable.
Chris Nicholson	[4068.566-4071.434]	There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.
Chris Nicholson	[4072.675-4090.693]	I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of-- not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County, when it comes to AOD, are very different than the needs of central Denver.
Chris Nicholson	[4091.911-4101.254]	I can get to most places that I need to go, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.
Chris Nicholson	[4102.473-4109.378]	I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for $15 in Peggy's district, or yours.
Chris Nicholson	[4109.784-4109.784]	Exactly.
Chris Nicholson	[4111.490-4116.089]	But creating a system where the trip cap is $40 doesn't work for me.
Chris Nicholson	[4116.497-4121.605]	Creating a trip cap where it's $15 doesn't work for the people in her district.
Chris Nicholson	[4122.005-4133.286]	It strikes me that the right approach would be to have different levels of financial cap and different levels of trip cap to go along with them and let people pick.
Chris Nicholson	[4133.762-4136.493]	You want 60 trips at $15 per?
Chris Nicholson	[4137.505-4137.505]	Great.
Chris Nicholson	[4137.826-4140.025]	You want 50 trips at $20 per?
Chris Nicholson	[4140.511-4140.511]	Great.
Chris Nicholson	[4140.792-4143.317]	You want 40 trips at $30 per?
Chris Nicholson	[4144.098-4144.098]	Great.
Chris Nicholson	[4144.399-4147.288]	Depends on where you live, depends on the types of trips you're going to be taking.
Chris Nicholson	[4147.545-4166.445]	But making people all fit into one size is either going to leave her people paying $20 for every single trip that they take, or it's going to put people in my district in a reduced number of rides, because very few trips are going to cost $20 or $25.
Chris Nicholson	[4167.137-4168.670]	Those are my two pieces of feedback.
Chris Nicholson	[4168.946-4170.178]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4171.430-4171.951]	Thank you, Secretary.
Julien Bouquet	[4173.013-4173.354]	Director Ruscha.
Joyann Ruscha	[4173.354-4178.673]	Thank you, Mr.
Joyann Ruscha	[4178.843-4178.843]	Chair.
Joyann Ruscha	[4180.174-4184.264]	So I just wanted to offer a bit of context.
Joyann Ruscha	[4184.739-4189.236]	And the General Manager, please interrupt me if I'm framing this wrong.
Joyann Ruscha	[4190.025-4195.893]	But the conversation that we're having tonight is a framework of a potential path forward.
Joyann Ruscha	[4196.993-4209.940]	And because our OSS meeting went so long, we weren't able to get to the discussion and that also, I think, impacted our ability to have some interim discussions.
Joyann Ruscha	[4210.254-4218.739]	So I just want folks to keep an open mind to what staff is saying and definitely share that feedback because we're on a timeline.
Joyann Ruscha	[4219.053-4223.453]	But also just recognize that-- and please, if I'm saying this wrong, interrupt me.
Joyann Ruscha	[4223.453-4225.967]	But what is being presented is a concept framework.
Joyann Ruscha	[4227.853-4240.573]	So we'll get Board feedback, and then of course, staff is going to be working very closely with our existing customers and advocacy organizations to make further refinements and give us some more stuff to look at.
Joyann Ruscha	[4241.005-4247.721]	So I hope I didn't speak out of turn, but I just wanted to offer that for context.
Joyann Ruscha	[4248.877-4252.921]	And I'm also listening and taking notes, and I know staff is.
Joyann Ruscha	[4253.289-4264.709]	So I would just urge, if anyone has thoughts, one way or another, please share them tonight since we are also on a timeline with our existing partners and those contracts as well.
Joyann Ruscha	[4265.631-4265.811]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4267.114-4268.577]	Thank you, Director.
Julien Bouquet	[4268.577-4268.908]	Director Larsen.
Matt Larsen	[4272.886-4273.096]	Thank you.
Matt Larsen	[4273.447-4275.457]	I just have a question for Ms.
Matt Larsen	[4275.812-4275.812]	Vallejos.
Matt Larsen	[4277.596-4288.194]	So I seen one of these slides that it says in December of 2024, there were about 2,900 total active customers of Access-on-Demand.
Matt Larsen	[4290.982-4295.732]	So there were 2,900 people, roughly, who used it in all of December?
Matt Larsen	[4296.929-4297.262]	Is that right?
Erin Vallejos	[4298.751-4301.130]	No, that would be for the year, I believe.
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4302.736-4303.076]	As of.
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4303.076-4303.076]	OK.
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4304.017-4304.017]	As of.
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4304.017-4308.324]	So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year.
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4309.084-4309.294]	That's it?
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4311.201-4328.260]	And so I guess what I'm trying to just understand is so if we were going to spend, say $10 million or $15 million on 2,900 people, what do we think the equivalent is for just our regular riders?
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4328.959-4329.713]	Do we have any guess?
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4330.521-4332.649]	I mean, I know people have different ridership.
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4332.925-4350.901]	I'm just trying to get-- I mean, if we have a million customers a year and it's the majority of our budget, I'm just trying to get a sense of how the per person spend for a regular rider compares to the per person spend for Access-on-Demand Erin Vallejos: And I-- go ahead, Debra.
Let me-- Matt Larsen	[4353.393-4353.393]	Oh.
Debra Johnson	[4353.393-4354.384]	So if I can, Mr.
Debra Johnson	[4354.632-4356.613]	Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question.
Debra Johnson	[4357.162-4359.318]	I would not want us to conjecture and speculate.
Debra Johnson	[4359.668-4361.290]	We could double back and give you those numbers.
Debra Johnson	[4362.375-4364.946]	As we talk about, you use the term regular rider.
Debra Johnson	[4365.231-4367.802]	You're talking about those that are using fixed route service.
Debra Johnson	[4368.129-4371.010]	I just want to be clear and intentional with the language we're using going forward.
Debra Johnson	[4371.196-4375.425]	So we need to assess that, because it's a different level of service.
Debra Johnson	[4375.777-4379.654]	Because with fixed route bus, we're not providing curb to curb service.
Debra Johnson	[4380.366-4389.099]	And so we can double back and share that information with the Board, but I think it wouldn't be fruitful for us to guesstimate because this is critically important.
Debra Johnson	[4389.736-4394.933]	But as we come back and we have some guidance, we could provide that detailed information, if you will.
Debra Johnson	[4395.642-4395.812]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4397.965-4398.495]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4400.356-4401.905]	Any other Directors, comments?
Julien Bouquet	[4402.441-4402.976]	Yeah, Director Guzman.
Michael Guzman	[4404.185-4411.185]	I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area.
Michael Guzman	[4414.230-4427.176]	District C is fairly blessed with multiple forms of transit and fixed route where this is not a particular problem, but it is an issue in the suburban areas of the region.
Michael Guzman	[4427.961-4441.252]	And it is highly concerning that we would restrict it so much where people would be left off of the system that live within a quarter mile of a commuter bus, and still not be able to access this.
Michael Guzman	[4444.113-4456.051]	I also think that as we proceed into the future after the demographer's presentation to the Finance and Planning Committee, a big concern will be our aging population in the region.
Michael Guzman	[4457.310-4462.170]	And somebody said that this is a drop in the bucket for our budget.
Michael Guzman	[4463.698-4470.192]	Maybe right now, but eventually, this is going to catch up with us, which is why we're having this conversation.
Michael Guzman	[4470.533-4487.682]	And Access-on-Demand and folks that are able to, or out of need, utilize this system need to be considered as humans first and how we serve them, which is our mission.
Michael Guzman	[4488.812-4503.945]	They need connection as well, and not every one of them will be able to jump from a-- jump, roll, walk, shuffle to a fixed route form of transportation to get them to their destinations.
Michael Guzman	[4505.334-4510.620]	I have a question about the time on this.
Michael Guzman	[4512.363-4519.914]	If it's mirroring regular service provision for the whole region, it kind of makes sense.
Michael Guzman	[4520.285-4525.849]	But I would still be concerned for the reasons that emergencies don't happen on RTD's schedule.
Michael Guzman	[4527.221-4535.842]	And so somebody who already has a specific need for this type of transportation usage might need to go to the doctor.
Michael Guzman	[4536.774-4539.207]	And what do they do if they're unable to drive.
Michael Guzman	[4539.980-4544.039]	And regular bus service is not something that they can use because the buses aren't running?
Michael Guzman	[4544.891-4550.246]	At 2 o'clock in the morning, emergency room visit is not unheard of and not uncommon in anybody's life.
Michael Guzman	[4551.085-4553.685]	And yet, what do we do to take care of those that are most vulnerable?
Michael Guzman	[4555.234-4559.561]	So for me, I would really want to see some clarity around those two areas.
Michael Guzman	[4561.044-4566.034]	I am frankly less concerned about minimal difference of cost savings.
Michael Guzman	[4567.474-4569.211]	I mean, we're talking $5 million.
Michael Guzman	[4570.039-4576.883]	This is not really the top priority for me on that part right now.
Michael Guzman	[4577.235-4581.108]	It will eventually get there because this will likely continue to grow.
Michael Guzman	[4581.500-4588.503]	But I do want to make sure that we are basing ourselves in reality to serve the taxpayers' needs.
Michael Guzman	[4589.714-4591.477]	And this is a need.
Michael Guzman	[4592.378-4596.352]	This is not a desire, as some of the other services we want to grow and create are.
Michael Guzman	[4596.586-4597.754]	This one is an actual need.
Michael Guzman	[4598.749-4604.374]	And so I want to be clear in my language on that and why I'm depositing these comments within that framework.
Michael Guzman	[4605.106-4606.109]	So that would be my feedback.
Michael Guzman	[4606.351-4610.632]	I'd like to see something a little bit different on those two things, the service area and the time for service.
Michael Guzman	[4611.027-4611.177]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4611.910-4613.275]	Thank you, Director.
Julien Bouquet	[4613.275-4613.636]	Director Harwick.
Ian Harwick	[4613.636-4616.798]	Well, thank you, Director Guzman.
Ian Harwick	[4617.275-4619.386]	I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you just said.
Ian Harwick	[4619.617-4628.207]	I represent Arvada, and Arvada is actually the fastest growing aging population.
Ian Harwick	[4629.189-4631.228]	However I said that, I'm not sure I said it right.
Ian Harwick	[4632.012-4637.138]	And a lot of our service is not in the areas where we have those aging people.
Ian Harwick	[4638.039-4642.932]	So I'd really like to see just the boundary kept the same.
Ian Harwick	[4643.392-4647.614]	I'm also really, again, with Director Guzman, keeping it at a full 24/7.
Ian Harwick	[4649.364-4663.047]	I have a friend in a wheelchair and I just think about her trying-- like if she didn't live where she lived, if she lived where I lived, she would have such a difficult time getting around her community.
Ian Harwick	[4663.389-4669.720]	And I would just-- especially if the service is outside of that time period, it's just precluding her life.
Ian Harwick	[4670.278-4681.707]	I know we don't all have the same abilities when we're riding a bus, but for a person with disability that's blind or in a wheelchair, I think that we can extend them the grace that they deserve.
Ian Harwick	[4682.843-4685.083]	I also would like to see the cap stay at 60.
Ian Harwick	[4685.327-4692.501]	I think that, again, I know that less than 10% of the population go above the 50 rides.
Ian Harwick	[4692.843-4698.308]	But I think it's still, we're giving them access to a free and full life.
Ian Harwick	[4699.712-4704.291]	And I think if we are going to go the 6.50, I think that that, to me is fine.
Ian Harwick	[4704.532-4712.910]	But I also think that it would be imperative that we really put out the LiVE program and let those riders know that there is another option.
Ian Harwick	[4713.245-4715.590]	I was with someone the other day.
Ian Harwick	[4715.925-4722.289]	She lives about 3 miles away from where she works, and she can afford it, but just barely.
Ian Harwick	[4722.624-4724.969]	And she didn't know about the LiVE program.
Ian Harwick	[4725.304-4730.506]	So I think that we're missing an opportunity there specifically with these riders.
Ian Harwick	[4731.260-4733.344]	And then my last one is just a request.
Ian Harwick	[4733.624-4741.024]	Is it possible to get a map, sort of like a density map, of where AOD is highly being used?
Ian Harwick	[4741.377-4749.835]	To go with that thinking about West Jefferson County versus central Denver, just kind see what that looks like.
Ian Harwick	[4750.267-4757.480]	Obviously, we want to anonymize the data, but I think it just would be interesting for us to know where the hotspots of usage are.
Ian Harwick	[4758.393-4758.563]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4758.753-4759.294]	Thank you, Director Harwick.
Julien Bouquet	[4759.655-4759.655]	Ms.
Julien Bouquet	[4759.875-4759.875]	Johnson.
Debra Johnson	[4759.875-4761.397]	Yes.
Debra Johnson	[4761.730-4779.406]	Director Harwick, if I understood you correctly, because I'm taking copious notes here, you are in support, for all intents and purposes, of what I hear, modification of scenario one, keeping it at 60 trips with 6.50, and then want information relative to what the current usage is from a geographic vantage point.
Debra Johnson	[4780.259-4780.259]	OK.
Debra Johnson	[4780.700-4780.870]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[4782.221-4782.572]	Thank you.
Ian Harwick	[4782.942-4786.715]	Yeah, but I also want to keep the service areas the same as they are today.
Ian Harwick	[4787.508-4787.508]	Yeah.
Julien Bouquet	[4789.713-4789.713]	Excellent.
Julien Bouquet	[4791.637-4794.171]	Director Nicholson, then Director Ruscha.
Chris Nicholson	[4794.884-4798.093]	Yeah, just a quick follow up onto that.
Chris Nicholson	[4799.533-4802.115]	When it comes to-- go to Director Ruscha.
Chris Nicholson	[4802.483-4806.540]	My brain-- I lost my train of thought for a second, so.
Julien Bouquet	[4808.151-4808.351]	All right.
Julien Bouquet	[4808.552-4808.752]	Director Ruscha.
Joyann Ruscha	[4808.752-4814.762]	Thank you for the Red Rover.
Joyann Ruscha	[4815.022-4815.543]	I wasn't prepared.
Joyann Ruscha	[4815.824-4816.575]	I went back to my notes.
Joyann Ruscha	[4817.206-4817.206]	OK.
Joyann Ruscha	[4817.784-4831.884]	So anyway, so some of this feedback I did share with staff and I don't want to be repetitive, but I also just want to be really transparent with my colleagues because we haven't had this public conversation yet.
Joyann Ruscha	[4832.609-4849.636]	And just high level, some of the things that I had shared was, first of all, we don't want to put one proposal out before the community and get feedback, like the one that we've had out for several months, and then come back with something else that looks like less than what we originally proposed.
Joyann Ruscha	[4850.016-4856.955]	And so one of the pain points that I had was just the idea of going up to 6.50 for the initial fare, because that's not what we originally put out there.
Joyann Ruscha	[4857.526-4867.960]	So one of the things that I urge is that if we put an offer on the table, so to speak, we don't take it back.
Joyann Ruscha	[4868.958-4870.193]	That's our baseline now.
Joyann Ruscha	[4871.200-4890.354]	And another piece of feedback I had is that where something is not-- for every change we make, which essentially results in a reduction of a service of some kind or an increase in price, we really have to justify that line by line.
Joyann Ruscha	[4891.121-4899.569]	So, for example, if we decide that we are going to strictly align with service hours, then we have to justify it.
Joyann Ruscha	[4899.569-4900.838]	It doesn't cost us any more money.
Joyann Ruscha	[4901.230-4910.892]	It's not going to save us a penny if somebody uses on-Demand 15 or 20 minutes or an hour before fixed route starts.
Joyann Ruscha	[4912.961-4922.312]	Likewise, it's not costing us, that I could see, a lot of money, if any, for us to offer service outside of our general service area.
Joyann Ruscha	[4923.801-4926.383]	I know that was flagged in the peer review.
Joyann Ruscha	[4927.855-4945.651]	Because this idea has been on the table for so many months, I also want to caution us about the service area idea, because if we restrict this service, that means there are people who currently are using AOD and they're going to lose it.
Joyann Ruscha	[4950.410-4958.432]	I mean, that was just a kind of high level theme that I had in the feedback.
Joyann Ruscha	[4959.925-4974.874]	And also, I going back to the initial affair, we also want to be really careful about what we think is inexpensive, because it's really relative.
Joyann Ruscha	[4975.240-4990.251]	So for some folks using this service and they have a fixed income or very limited income, if we even do 4.50, which would be parity with Access-a-Ride-- and I think I could accept that.
Joyann Ruscha	[4990.617-5004.423]	But say we go up to 6.50 or we do this tiered system, then for some folks they are not going to be able to ride or they're going to be choosing, do I get to the doctor or do I buy food for tonight.
Joyann Ruscha	[5004.865-5008.139]	So I just wanted to put that out there.
Joyann Ruscha	[5008.969-5017.360]	And finally-- well, actually, I'll stop there.
Joyann Ruscha	[5018.778-5038.646]	I concurred with what a lot of other Directors said in terms of keeping the program as-is as much as we can, But I also just want to commend staff, because we are at a much different place than where we were several months ago.
Joyann Ruscha	[5039.724-5041.211]	This was a totally different conversation.
Joyann Ruscha	[5042.230-5047.455]	We're talking about really slashing this program, and staff did a lot of work and we spent several months.
Joyann Ruscha	[5047.715-5058.636]	We almost voted on this a few months ago, and they listened to us as Directors and they listened to community because, as you know, we've had hundreds of public comments over several months on this.
Joyann Ruscha	[5059.605-5064.381]	And they said, OK, we can take a timeout, we can reassess, we can get some different data.
Joyann Ruscha	[5064.662-5067.191]	We can present a new paradigm.
Joyann Ruscha	[5067.492-5070.014]	So again, what's before us today is a sketch of ideas.
Joyann Ruscha	[5070.266-5076.258]	The feedback is good, but I really do want to commend staff for listening and working with us in partnership.
Joyann Ruscha	[5076.592-5078.462]	So thank you and thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[5080.098-5080.745]	Thank you, Director Ruscha.
Julien Bouquet	[5081.160-5081.521]	Director Nicholson.
Chris Nicholson	[5081.521-5083.925]	Thank you.
Chris Nicholson	[5085.953-5100.431]	Is there any step during enrollment of AAR and AOD where we ask people if they are enrolled in the LiVE program and ask them, hey, we're taking 14 other pieces of documentation from you?
Chris Nicholson	[5100.877-5104.429]	I mean, AOD or AAR is remarkably complicated to sign up for.
Chris Nicholson	[5104.884-5111.393]	Is there any part of that process where we try to enroll them in the LiVE program as well?
Chris Nicholson	[5111.795-5112.812]	And then I have a quick follow up.
Erin Vallejos	[5117.678-5125.342]	I will have to find out about that as part of the process, and we will confirm if that is how that is handled as part of the process.
Chris Nicholson	[5126.708-5126.708]	Yeah.
Chris Nicholson	[5126.988-5147.165]	So yeah, as a first thing, I would say that since we're going to be updating this to offer the LiVE discount and not make it free, it should be required as part of the process if you're going through to sign up for AOD or AAR, some point in that process, to ask someone to affirm that they are either already signed up or haven't signed up or whatever.
Chris Nicholson	[5147.437-5148.795]	And then give them the opportunity.
Chris Nicholson	[5149.338-5156.724]	Make it super easy because we only have 15,000 people signed up for LiVE right now, and we have 180 something thousand boardings every day.
Chris Nicholson	[5157.193-5163.405]	And I think only about half the people in AOD are currently signed up for-- or AAR are currently signed up for LiVE.
Chris Nicholson	[5163.761-5165.846]	So definitely something I'd like to see there.
Chris Nicholson	[5166.164-5167.262]	The second thing.
Chris Nicholson	[5167.811-5177.633]	I want to echo what Director Ruscha said about the effect on people who are low income to having these fares.
Chris Nicholson	[5177.897-5195.237]	But I want to take it from the other side, which is if you don't have a lot of money and you need to get around to a lot of places, then 40 trips may be, or whatever the number ends up being, not nearly enough in a way that someone who makes more money can probably have some discretionary to be like, oh, I've run out of trips.
Chris Nicholson	[5195.576-5198.532]	I can afford to take an extra three or five or whatever.
Chris Nicholson	[5198.841-5202.673]	So I'm not sure that needs to be fit into the policy here.
Chris Nicholson	[5203.028-5205.300]	I'm wary about trying to do too much too quickly.
Chris Nicholson	[5205.892-5216.069]	But I do think we need to get a report from you after, I don't know, six months, a year, that looks at how many trips are people on LiVE using.
Chris Nicholson	[5216.629-5217.666]	Are they maxing out?
Chris Nicholson	[5218.031-5223.817]	Or are we seeing the same curve from LiVE users as we do from regular users right now?
Chris Nicholson	[5224.179-5232.511]	And that might inform us to take action a year from now to try to offer the right service for people who need it.
Chris Nicholson	[5232.913-5236.797]	Some LiVE people make decent incomes, some of them are literally broke.
Chris Nicholson	[5237.133-5242.172]	And we need to recognize that those two groups of people have very different lived experiences.
Julien Bouquet	[5243.209-5243.796]	Thank you, Secretary.
Julien Bouquet	[5244.170-5244.170]	Ms.
Julien Bouquet	[5244.371-5244.371]	Johnson.
Debra Johnson	[5244.371-5246.997]	Yes, thank you very much, Director Nicholson.
Debra Johnson	[5247.717-5248.248]	Thank you, Mr.
Debra Johnson	[5248.514-5248.514]	Chair.
Debra Johnson	[5248.799-5250.636]	Thank you, Director Nicholson, for the comments.
Debra Johnson	[5251.403-5253.713]	And what I will say in reference to your request.
Debra Johnson	[5253.969-5258.263]	It appeared to be a directive, but I would just offer this up to you.
Debra Johnson	[5258.565-5267.812]	That once we collectively agree upon the path forward and this Board acts, we can then assess what might be most prudent, because at this point in time, we don't know what we don't know.
Debra Johnson	[5268.068-5273.532]	And relative to what you just asked, I can't commit to that without knowing what we intend to do.
Debra Johnson	[5273.996-5277.153]	So I just had to say that for the record, because it seems as if Ms.
Debra Johnson	[5277.401-5280.372]	Vallejos was getting direction, and I don't think that's appropriate at this juncture.
Debra Johnson	[5280.640-5280.990]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[5282.862-5283.012]	Thank you.
Julien Bouquet	[5283.263-5283.563]	Director Larsen.
Matt Larsen	[5285.605-5285.815]	Thank you.
Matt Larsen	[5286.922-5292.175]	I was just kind of doing some stuff on my calculator.
Matt Larsen	[5293.185-5307.103]	So if we only have 3,000 people who use Access-on-Demand , I mean, it seems like the disabled population might be 300,000 people in Denver or
Matt Larsen	[5308.576-5308.944]	something. Much, much
Matt Larsen	[5311.789-5317.112]	larger. How confident are we of our projection that it will stay at around, I mean, or however much we think it will
Matt Larsen	[5317.386-5322.550]	increase? I mean, what do we think the total number of active users might
Matt Larsen	[5322.947-5328.509]	become? And why won't it become many multiples more than 3,000 or
Matt Larsen	[5334.522-5335.623]	so? Debra Johnson: First, if I
Matt Larsen	[5335.990-5342.966]	may. Just for everyone's edification, probably you have heard this over the course of several months in the public comment
Matt Larsen	[5344.034-5358.753]	discussions. When we talk about Access-on-Demand, currently as it's configured, recognizing that we're using private entities, transportation network companies in particular, not all of the vehicles are outfitted to be wheelchair
Matt Larsen	[5359.497-5366.834]	accessible. So that's a critical element when we're talking about the population, because there's different disabilities that individuals
Matt Larsen	[5367.366-5368.582]	have. Some may have
Matt Larsen	[5368.987-5373.850]	cognitive. Somebody may be using a mobility device which can't be accommodated going
Matt Larsen	[5374.275-5376.932]	forward. So I just wanted to provide that context prior to
Matt Larsen	[5377.218-5383.271]	Ms. Vallejos answering the question, because that has not been factored in to this conversation this evening, and I believe it's a germane
point. Julien Bouquet	[5385.508-5385.922]	Thank you,
Director. Erin Vallejos	[5386.632-5388.488]	And I don't think I need to add
Director. Erin Vallejos	[5388.720-5390.807]	anything. That was really exactly what I was going to
Director. Erin Vallejos	[5391.059-5396.355]	say. Not everyone is able to use the Access-on-Demand service that is eligible for
Director. Erin Vallejos	[5397.109-5398.183]	Access-a-Ride. There is a difference
there. Matt Larsen	[5399.152-5399.890]	Can I just follow
there. Matt Larsen	[5400.094-5406.636]	up? But I mean, surely many more people than 3,000 in the metro area would be eligible,
there. Matt Larsen	[5408.547-5408.547]	though. I
mean. Erin Vallejos	[5408.547-5417.755]	Well, and again, we have continued to see substantial growth in the number of customers that are beginning to use the
mean. Erin Vallejos	[5418.585-5422.563]	service. Again, the trips that we are seeing continue to grow even into this
mean. Erin Vallejos	[5422.929-5427.869]	year. So we are seeing quite significant growth
still. Julien Bouquet	[5428.595-5428.755]	Thank
you. Matt Larsen	[5429.095-5429.275]	Thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5429.476-5429.996]	Thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5431.758-5432.854]	you. Any further questions,
you. Julien Bouquet	[5434.861-5434.861]	comments?
you. Julien Bouquet	[5435.702-5436.209]	Ms. Johnson and
you. Julien Bouquet	[5436.483-5438.235]	Ms. Vallejos, thank you very much for the
you. Julien Bouquet	[5438.525-5440.571]	presentation. I hope this was helpful feedback for going
you. Julien Bouquet	[5441.247-5441.728]	forward. So thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5442.573-5442.573]	you. Debra Johnson:
you. Julien Bouquet	[5442.777-5443.186]	Yes. Thank you,
you. Julien Bouquet	[5443.391-5443.391]	Mr.
you. Julien Bouquet	[5443.695-5446.082]	Chair. This was in the sense that we do have some
you. Julien Bouquet	[5446.320-5449.357]	guidance. Now we know what we need to do as we do further
you. Julien Bouquet	[5449.624-5451.725]	outreach. So thank you all very much for the
you. Julien Bouquet	[5452.028-5461.568]	opportunity. And when we come back in July with a recommended action, hopefully we can all rally around that, recognizing the public comments that we heard and the direction in which you
you. Julien Bouquet	[5462.204-5462.395]	provided. Thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5462.845-5463.006]	Thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5463.666-5463.947]	you. Director
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5463.947-5467.723]	Will that recommended action be going through Operation Safety and
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5469.756-5469.756]	Security. Julien Bouquet:
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5469.936-5469.936]	Ms.
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5469.936-5470.619]	Johnson. Debra Johnson:
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5470.998-5472.515]	Yes. Thank you very much,
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5472.894-5472.894]	Mr.
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5473.273-5477.150]	Chair. And thank you, Director "Guz-min--" Guzman, I apologize, for the
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5477.855-5480.154]	question. Most definitely, we will go through the committee
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5480.461-5482.848]	procedure. The only reason why this didn't happen because it's time
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5483.548-5483.909]	sensitive. So thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5484.931-5485.427]	Thank you very
you. Julien Bouquet	[5486.775-5486.945]	much. All
you. Julien Bouquet	[5487.196-5488.046]	right. Well, thank you again,
you. Julien Bouquet	[5488.299-5488.299]	Ms.
you. Julien Bouquet	[5489.637-5490.503]	Vallejos. All right, moving
you. Julien Bouquet	[5490.792-5492.812]	on. Thank you, Directors, for the questions and
you. Julien Bouquet	[5493.602-5496.204]	conversations. We're going to be moving to our committee
you. Julien Bouquet	[5496.575-5499.177]	reports. Not to be the time police or
you. Julien Bouquet	[5499.589-5502.787]	anything. We are at 8:31 PM and we've been going at this since
you. Julien Bouquet	[5503.613-5507.051]	3:30. If committee reports could be less than a minute, that'd be greatly
you. Julien Bouquet	[5507.938-5508.893]	appreciated. Audit Committee Chair
you. Julien Bouquet	[5509.212-5510.804]	Buzek. What would you like to
you. Julien Bouquet	[5512.064-5512.465]	share? Vince Buzek: Thank you,
you. Julien Bouquet	[5512.666-5512.666]	Mr.
you. Julien Bouquet	[5512.906-5514.326]	Chair. We did not meet in April or
you. Julien Bouquet	[5514.549-5516.559]	May. Our next meeting is June 12,
you. Julien Bouquet	[5516.994-5517.790]	2025. That concludes my
you. Julien Bouquet	[5518.437-5518.788]	report. Thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5519.158-5519.684]	Thank you very
you. Julien Bouquet	[5521.804-5523.087]	much. Finance and Planning Committee
you. Julien Bouquet	[5523.407-5524.048]	report. Committee Chair
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5524.048-5524.953]	Thank you,
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5525.128-5525.128]	Mr.
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5526.504-5533.738]	Chair. The Finance Planning Committee met Tuesday, May 13, discussed a handful of items, received a report from our state demographer, which was really
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5534.794-5542.756]	awesome. Directors are reminded to email the Board Office if you had any follow up questions or things specific to your sub district, so we can send that all at once to receive an answer to the whole
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5543.684-5552.552]	Board. Received an update from Doti for the East Colfax BRT, and three items came out of committee which will be before us
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5553.526-5555.308]	tonight. Just want to thank the committee for all of the hard
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5556.292-5565.050]	work. And the next meeting for the Finance and Planning Committee is scheduled for Tuesday, June 10 at 10:25-- or sorry, at 5:30
Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5565.050-5565.210]	PM. Thank
you. Julien Bouquet	[5566.613-5566.987]	Thank you,
you. Julien Bouquet	[5568.357-5572.677]	Director . Committee Chair Ruscha or Committee Chair Harwick, what would you like to share
you. Julien Bouquet	[5573.962-5574.413]	for OSS? Joyann Ruscha: I'll take
you. Julien Bouquet	[5575.484-5575.655]	it, sir.
you. Julien Bouquet	[5575.865-5578.301]	Thank you. So we met remotely on Wednesday,
you. Julien Bouquet	[5579.490-5584.271]	May 14. We gaveled in at 5:34 PM and wrapped up at
you. Julien Bouquet	[5585.319-5589.786]	9:44 PM. We had extensive public comments, the most I've ever seen at any
you. Julien Bouquet	[5591.087-5591.448]	OSS meeting. That
you. Julien Bouquet	[5591.708-5592.639]	was great. Come visit
you. Julien Bouquet	[5594.012-5598.084]	us anytime. It's always nice to know that people are listening to our podcast, and by that I mean our
you. Julien Bouquet	[5598.278-5603.762]	YouTube channel. But two major items that went on the consent calendar for
you. Julien Bouquet	[5604.220-5606.962]	tonight's meeting. Is the 2025, 2028 Title VI
you. Julien Bouquet	[5607.419-5620.673]	program update. Just ensuring that we stay in compliance with federal law, Civil Rights protections, and meet the needs of our customers, as well as the Allied Universal Security Services
you. Julien Bouquet	[5621.110-5625.596]	Contract Extension. F&P authorized a budget transfer which had no
you. Julien Bouquet	[5626.195-5627.887]	financial impact. It was just moving from one department
you. Julien Bouquet	[5628.598-5636.552]	to another. And then we followed that up with a vote to extend that contract for another year, with the cost of up to just a little over
you. Julien Bouquet	[5637.628-5640.821]	22 million. And we did have four discussion items, two of which
you. Julien Bouquet	[5642.133-5645.882]	were heard. So we had the Vision Zero update from GM
you. Julien Bouquet	[5646.693-5651.455]	CEO Johnson. As you might recall, we passed a Vision Zero resolution last year and so that planning process
you. Julien Bouquet	[5652.541-5654.428]	is underway. We had a customer
you. Julien Bouquet	[5655.506-5665.384]	communications update. Stuart Summers led an excellent presentation discussing how we handle communications, some tech updates, customer
you. Julien Bouquet	[5665.981-5668.990]	service aspects. It was real-time information and service alerts and things
you. Julien Bouquet	[5670.088-5673.383]	like that. Unfortunately, we did hit our four hour mark before we could finish our
you. Julien Bouquet	[5673.637-5677.186]	agenda items. And even though the Nuggets weren't playing, folks wanted to go and we
you. Julien Bouquet	[5678.020-5683.630]	were tired. So we moved the on-Demand item to tonight's meeting, which we
you. Julien Bouquet	[5684.062-5688.677]	just heard. And then we'll be hearing paratransit legacy customer protections proposal
you. Julien Bouquet	[5689.599-5701.066]	next month. So for those of you who have been tracking what we're doing with paratransit, I strongly encourage you to come visit us at OSS next month and weigh in so we get your feedback before we come back with something
you. Julien Bouquet	[5702.214-5706.050]	more final. Our next meeting is Wednesday, June 11
you. Julien Bouquet	[5706.529-5710.365]	at 5:30. Same time, same place, online or on
you. Julien Bouquet	[5711.625-5711.775]	the phone.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5712.406-5713.458]	Thank you,
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5714.562-5716.576]	Committee Chair. Now to for Performance Committee
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5716.576-5717.712]	I
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5718.573-5719.014]	got it. Thank
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5719.234-5719.234]	you,
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5719.895-5721.458]	Mr. Chair. Performance committee met Monday, May
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5722.423-5749.617]	12, 2025. I, the Committee Chair, presented a draft proposal that I had worked on previously with Vice Chair Gutschenritter for the 2025 General Manager/CEO performance assessment form and process that needed to be updated to seek input from the committee and other Directors to find a way forward for the rest of the year based on the current 2025 General Manager/CEO short term goals and the respective adjustments made to the scoring points based on our votes
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5750.508-5751.515]	in January. I've received
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5752.031-5754.934]	some feedback. I continue to invite Directors to submit
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5755.337-5760.342]	their feedback. If you have not reviewed that meeting, please do so, and any questions you may have, please email me or
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5760.868-5762.867]	call me. I am happy to engage in
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5763.894-5771.908]	that conversation. Of course, we are doing that with participation and a lot of communication with the General Manager/CEO,
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5772.698-5777.564]	Debra Johnson. The next meeting of the Performance Committee is scheduled for June 2, 2025 at
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5778.469-5783.313]	8:30 AM. I really want to encourage all of you Directors to please participate in
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5784.401-5784.651]	that meeting.
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5785.042-5800.420]	Two reasons. One, we are going to receive-- I hope I don't get this wrong because I don't have my work plan in front of me, but the employee survey results in the beginning of that meeting, and then we will adjourn into executive session for the second quarterly one-on-one opportunity with our
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5801.724-5815.004]	General Manager/CEO. And that is part of our contracted agreement with the General Manager/CEO to receive information from her and provide feedback regarding
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5816.962-5823.827]	personnel matters. Additionally, the Performance Committee is set to have a second meeting in June because of that
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5825.192-5839.238]	quarterly check-in. The second meeting is planned, I believe, for June 23 at 8:30 AM, and that is in order to do a deep dive into our community and customer surveys, which align with our community value and customer excellence
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5840.170-5851.183]	strategic initiatives. And I would again encourage all Directors to participate in that meeting as well, which is the overview of the current status of the agency's surveys and where we're at with regard
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5851.949-5859.392]	to public. It will inform the process for setting goals and priorities for the 2026 year which we are also doing all at the
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5859.916-5873.174]	same time. So prioritizing what is important for our customers, the survey reports are a great opportunity to engage with direct feedback from our constituents in all areas of
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5874.100-5880.304]	the agency. And I do believe a little birdie has told me on one of the buses that these should be really
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5881.295-5890.617]	positive discussions. So if you need more than that invitation, please signal tonight and I will call you and email you and hound you to be on these meetings, because I think they're really important for all
Chair Guzman. Michael Guzman	[5890.916-5891.066]	of us.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5892.239-5893.714]	Thank you, Committee
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5894.232-5894.793]	Chair Guzman. All right,
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5895.875-5898.871]	moving on. We're going to do the approval of Board meeting minutes and
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5899.522-5902.957]	committee reports. The Board and committee meeting minutes were included in the
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5903.991-5907.862]	Board packet. Are there any corrections from the Board for the minutes to be approved
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5911.345-5911.605]	this evening?
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5913.489-5913.801]	Any corrections?
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5913.801-5920.356]	All right. Unless there's objection to considering the minutes all at the same time, may I please have a motion to approve the minutes for the
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5921.225-5924.144]	following meetings? The April 9, 2025 Operation Safety and
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5925.029-5926.965]	Security Committee. The April 29, 2025
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5927.912-5929.881]	Board meeting. The May 12, 2025
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5930.515-5932.472]	Performance Committee. The May 13, 2025 Finance and
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5933.699-5936.274]	Planning Committee. May 14, 2025 Operation Safety and
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5936.942-5939.430]	Security Committee. And then May 22, 2025
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5940.246-5940.506]	Executive Committee. Michael Guzman:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5940.786-5940.786]	So
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5941.587-5942.058]	moved. Guzman. Julien Bouquet:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[5943.610-5943.910]	Mover, Guzman. Joyann
Ruscha	[5943.910-5943.910]	Second. Chris
Gutschenritter	[5944.891-5946.119]	Second. Julien Bouquet: I'm going to give it
Gutschenritter	[5949.211-5953.209]	to Gutschenritter. So I heard Director Guzman as the mover and Director Gutschenritter as
Gutschenritter	[5953.496-5954.714]	the second. Is there any discussion on
Gutschenritter	[5959.703-5959.703]	this
Gutschenritter	[5960.244-5961.651]	motion? OK. Seeing none, I'll now call
Gutschenritter	[5962.006-5963.337]	the vote. Are there any no votes on
Gutschenritter	[5966.771-5970.117]	this action? It'll pass 14, 0, and
Gutschenritter	[5972.417-5972.417]	1
Gutschenritter	[5973.519-5973.719]	absent. Excellent.
Gutschenritter	[5975.975-5976.273]	All right.
Gutschenritter	[5976.571-5978.060]	Moving on. It will be our
Gutschenritter	[5978.778-5983.919]	Chair's report. Due to the late hour, I will be quoting my principal and saying, I am giving you all the gift
Gutschenritter	[5984.724-5993.054]	of time. And all I can say with my Chair's report is we will have a Board retreat on June 7 talking about our 2026 priorities for
Gutschenritter	[5993.974-5996.164]	the agency. Again, Directors, hopefully you all can
Gutschenritter	[5996.517-6003.878]	make that. It'll be a very healthy discussion, a very hearty discussion, I guarantee, but please make sure you have that marked down in
Gutschenritter	[6004.586-6004.786]	your calendars.
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6008.662-6010.865]	Did you want to remind everybody about the survey we
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6011.085-6011.306]	sent you? Julien Bouquet:
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6011.666-6011.867]	Of course.
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6012.467-6015.585]	Thank you. And of course, Directors, you'll see in my weekly
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6015.932-6022.154]	biweekly update. There was a survey that might have been passed to you, and if you've not filled out that survey, please
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6022.862-6025.782]	do so. Thank you for the Directors who did fill
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6026.307-6027.122]	it in. So
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6028.230-6033.832]	that's OK. If we could get that in by Monday morning, that would
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6034.359-6035.918]	be excellent. I'll include that in my weekly
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6036.321-6036.541]	update, though.
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6037.973-6040.448]	Thank you. I'll give it now over to you,
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6040.448-6043.584]	GM/CEO Johnson. Debra Johnson: Thank you very
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6043.886-6043.886]	much,
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6044.187-6055.938]	Mr. Chair. And to recognize the lateness of the hour, I just have a couple elements that I'll share with you that are in alignment with our activities and strategic endeavors since our last Board meeting on Tuesday,
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6058.142-6068.067]	April 29. One notable aspect is the legislative conference held by the American Public Transportation Association from May 18th to the 20th in
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6068.449-6079.540]	Washington, DC. Just for everyone's edification, this annual conference is an opportunity for Public Transportation industry professionals across the nation to visit Washington, DC and connect with policymakers, implementers, and
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6080.583-6090.525]	their staffs. The conference helps educate and inform APTA members on important federal legislation and policy initiatives, and affords an unparalleled opportunity to shape the industry's positions in federal
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6091.349-6100.879]	advocacy agenda. I, along with Directors O'Keefe, Chandler, and Gutschenritter, and Government Relations Officer Michael Davies, attended conference sessions and meetings with members of Colorado's congressional delegation and
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6101.208-6117.555]	their staffs. While chairing an APTA committee meeting on Sunday, May 8, I personally engaged with Tariq Bokhari, who is the acting administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, who shared his views and inputs as it relates to public transit, as well as the importance of federal and
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6118.332-6125.272]	local partnerships. Just yesterday, Tuesday, May 27, I, along with members of my team, met with individuals representing the alliance to
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6126.380-6131.428]	transform transportation. As you may be aware, it's a coalition of groups on transit related matters
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6132.406-6140.807]	in Colorado. Alliance representatives in attendance included executive Director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Danny Katz, or CPIRG, as we refer
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6141.189-6144.244]	to it. Jill Cantor, Executive Director of the Denver
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6144.626-6151.747]	Streets Partnership. Portia Prescott, Present of the Rocky Mountain NAACP branch of the State Conference representing Colorado, Montana,
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6152.117-6154.706]	and Wyoming. Dennis Hawkins, representing the Amalgamated Transit
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6156.233-6158.522]	Union 1001. Matt Fromer, representing transportation and
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6158.903-6164.626]	land use. Well, he is the Transportation and Land Use Policy Manager from the Southwest Energy
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6165.027-6169.119]	Efficiency Project. The meeting really was focused on alliance's vision for transit in the
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6170.235-6183.694]	Denver region. As you know, they have been very vocal in which they're seeking to increase funding for transit in the Denver region by $420 million per year to bolster the frequency and availability of transit services in the
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6186.159-6200.555]	metro area. From RTD's perspective, questions were posed relative to how that $420 million figure was derived, and they explained how that came about with the work they had done with the third
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6200.993-6204.061]	party entity. Very bare bones relative to providing
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6204.884-6220.463]	some information. And then we talked about the agency's focus, which all of you are very well aware that we are laser focused on asset renewal, state of good repair, and rightsizing transit service in alignment with RTD's branded comprehensive operational analysis being the System
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6221.675-6222.805]	Optimization Plan. Related to
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6223.182-6235.237]	personal security. As was recently reported, RTD experienced a 60% reduction in security related calls for service, as well as a three year decrease in reports of criminal activities between 2022 and 2025 at Denver
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6235.674-6255.150]	Union Station. The decrease is representative of concerted efforts to restore and maintain a welcoming transit environment within the critical multi-modal transit hub and following a collaborative and multifaceted strategy aimed at enhancing personal safety and security through crime prevention through environmental
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6255.968-6271.796]	design methodologies. This effort would have not have been a success without the commitment of numerous agency employees, as well as support from the City and County of Denver, its police department, the Downtown Denver Partnership, Sage Hospitality, the Lower Denver Neighborhood Association, as well as several local businesses in downtown
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6272.705-6293.401]	Denver residents. Fare enforcement has also increased in recent months, which is the result of RTD's growing ranks of sworn police officers having been trained to perform this function alongside the contracted team that we have in security with Allied Universal personnel who had primarily been responsible for
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6294.465-6308.906]	this responsibility. I look forward to sharing additional details regarding the impacts of these efforts during the June Performance Committee, which you heard committee Chair Guzman reference when I, along with staff, will present data related to annual customer, community, and employee surveys that have
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6309.290-6324.142]	recently concluded. On a related note, the agency has proactively increased its transit police officer presence at Denver Union Station and across the agency's downtown Denver sector to support the personal safety and security of customers and visitors attending major events
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6324.513-6346.035]	and activity. Notably, while we're no longer in the hockey playoffs and NBA, but people had a welcoming experience in and around our facilities, and RTD PD had increased patrols at Denver Union Station and bus stops and rail stations before the high profile events, which included the playoff games I
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6346.771-6351.011]	just referenced. And this coincides with increasing Denver Police patrols throughout the
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6352.037-6358.501]	Downtown area. And RTD and DPD are working closely to collaborate to support enhanced safety for the
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6361.045-6373.358]	traveling public. And moreover, data and metrics related to personal safety and Security are now conveniently located on the recently created security related metrics page, and we've actually showcased that on other social media channels
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6374.921-6390.499]	as well. As it relates to our customer excellence in relation to the strategic priorities of customer excellence and employee ownership, I shared yesterday with the Board the last of the 31 light rail speed restrictions put into place last year on the D, H, and E and R lines was lifted as of
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6391.843-6395.749]	yesterday morning. I want to give a special shout out to our Maintenance of Way teams that have done
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6396.407-6405.694]	yeoman's work. The final speed restriction, which was approximately 400 feet in the southbound segment north of Southmoor Station, was removed after crews completed
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6408.798-6423.462]	those repairs. Keeping in mind those rigorous restrictions were put into place due to the fact that we enhanced our inspections of track back in May 2024 as an enhanced focus on maintaining the agency's assets in a state of
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6424.251-6427.743]	good repair. At the time, crews found several minor issues and
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6428.475-6440.308]	track imperfections. So, as I said before, I thank and congratulate all the agency employees who work tire-- I'm tired-- tirelessly over the course of these
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6441.147-6444.480]	11 months. And like I said, a special shout out
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6446.534-6456.028]	to MOW. I would be remiss if I didn't state that while this is a cause to celebrate, I shared previously, as we look at our infrastructure and it continues to age, this will be par for
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6456.291-6460.774]	the course. But since we're ahead of where we were before, we will see less of an impact,
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6461.900-6468.445]	I'm certain. And last, but certainly not least, I'm pleased to welcome RTD's new Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who's in
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6468.912-6469.483]	the audience. She's giving
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6469.990-6471.587]	a wave. Who began her tenure on
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6472.173-6474.444]	May 12. And this is her first in-person
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6474.696-6482.076]	Board meeting. While we introduced her at the Finance and Planning Committee, you guys are real people, not figments of our imagination, so I wanted to ensure I did
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6482.327-6487.915]	that here. So with that, I will yield the floor so we can move on to the rest of the matters that we have
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6487.915-6488.988]	before us. So thank you very
Thank you. Chris Nicholson	[6489.202-6489.202]	much,
Mr. Chair. Julien Bouquet	[6492.160-6493.482]	Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Julien Bouquet	[6494.824-6497.262]	GM/CEO Johnson. Any comments or questions for
Mr. Chair. Julien Bouquet	[6500.855-6500.855]	GM/CEO Johnson? Chris Nicholson:
Mr. Chair. Julien Bouquet	[6500.855-6500.855]	Just [INAUDIBLE]. Julien
Bouquet	[6506.261-6506.582]	Yeah.
Bouquet	[6507.242-6508.544]	Very exciting. And Kelly, welcome to
Bouquet	[6509.324-6509.494]	the team.
Bouquet	[6512.488-6512.688]	Thank you.
Bouquet	[6513.409-6513.770]	All right.
Bouquet	[6514.759-6516.889]	Moving on. We're going to move on to
Bouquet	[6518.011-6524.356]	unanimous consent. There are three items on the unanimous consent agenda listed under Section 16, actions A
Bouquet	[6524.752-6535.100]	through C. Those items are the security operations budget transfer, the 2025-2028 Title VI program update, and the Allied Universal security services contract extension for
Bouquet	[6535.556-6544.102]	one year. I do understand that Director Benker would like to offer some amendments to item B, the 2025-2028 Title VI
Bouquet	[6544.529-6548.375]	program update. And such, I will move that our a
Bouquet	[6548.802-6549.230]	recommended actions.
Bouquet	[6549.677-6564.184]	Excuse me. If anyone else has a change to discussion on or questions about any of the remaining unanimous consent items, please feel free to advise the Chair at this time and I will, of course, be happy to pull the item from unanimous consent for consideration under
Bouquet	[6565.597-6565.967]	recommended action.
Director Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[6565.967-6569.963]	The Allied Universal
Director Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[6570.314-6571.015]	security contract. Please
Director Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[6571.705-6572.526]	pull that. Julien
Bouquet	[6572.526-6579.695]	OK. So item B will be removed and placed into recommended action
Bouquet	[6580.076-6585.626]	Excuse me. Former item C, as I look in real time here, the Allied
Bouquet	[6587.289-6589.199]	Universal security. So are we OK with security operations
Bouquet	[6593.919-6597.994]	budget transfer? Troy Whitmore: I would move to approve the remainder of the unanimous
Bouquet	[6598.726-6598.726]	consent agenda. Joyann
Ruscha	[6599.667-6599.983]	Second. Julien
Bouquet	[6599.983-6602.195]	OK. I have Whitmore and then Ruscha as
Bouquet	[6605.936-6606.907]	a second. Are
Bouquet	[6606.907-6623.375]	there-- OK. So this is item A for the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $3,845,437.10 between operating expenses lines for transit
Bouquet	[6626.481-6628.662]	security services. Is there any no votes
Bouquet	[6631.590-6631.590]	on
Bouquet	[6633.239-6635.437]	that? OK. Seeing none, that item will
Bouquet	[6636.564-6637.099]	pass 14-0-1.
Bouquet	[6637.635-6641.917]	All right. Now we're moving on to our recommended
Bouquet	[6643.214-6648.965]	action items. And we're going to have first on our list the Allied Universal security services contract extension for
Bouquet	[6650.845-6651.806]	one year. Is there
Bouquet	[6653.148-6653.548]	a motion? Chris Nicholson:
Bouquet	[6653.969-6654.249]	So moved. Julien Bouquet:
Bouquet	[6656.112-6656.353]	OK, Nicholson. And
Bouquet	[6657.515-6657.735]	a second.
Bouquet	[6659.658-6659.948]	And Ruscha.
Bouquet	[6660.239-6660.529]	All right.
Bouquet	[6662.001-6662.311]	Any discussion?
Bouquet	[6662.311-6663.192]	Director Nicholson? Chris
Nicholson	[6663.459-6667.191]	Yeah. So I just have a quick question about this one that came from
Nicholson	[6668.399-6675.055]	a constituent. How many people do we have working on our security side
Nicholson	[6676.090-6680.272]	from allied? And how many do we have from RTD PD
Nicholson	[6681.558-6681.699]	right now?
Nicholson	[6683.100-6683.100]	Thank you. Julien
Nicholson	[6683.261-6683.261]	Bouquet:
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[6683.261-6687.388]	Yes, I will yield the floor to Chief Martingano, who can address
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[6687.687-6687.857]	that question.
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[6690.591-6690.942]	Thank you. Julien Bouquet:
Chief Martingano. Steve Martingano	[6690.942-6693.731]	I am trying to
Chief Martingano. Steve Martingano	[6694.000-6694.537]	figure out. Oh, there
Chief Martingano. Steve Martingano	[6694.806-6695.075]	we go.
Chief Martingano. Steve Martingano	[6695.344-6695.882]	Turned green. Chair,
Chief Martingano. Steve Martingano	[6696.171-6696.171]	for me? Julien
Bouquet	[6696.551-6701.724]	Yes. Steve Martingano: Yeah, so technically, in regards to how many Allied personnel, it's an
Bouquet	[6702.378-6705.163]	hourly contract. So you'd have to take the amount of the hours and obviously divide it
Bouquet	[6705.402-6709.258]	by 40. It roughly equates to the recommended action for
Bouquet	[6709.707-6711.325]	next year. I think it's about
Bouquet	[6711.689-6714.440]	9,100 hours. So it roughly equates about 180
Bouquet	[6714.813-6720.201]	security officers. Right now, we currently have 87 on our staff in regards to post-certified
Bouquet	[6720.900-6723.964]	police officers. We have a couple in training and one in
Bouquet	[6724.271-6727.642]	the academy. We should be probably about 90 by the end of
Bouquet	[6728.308-6728.468]	next month. Julien Bouquet:
Bouquet	[6731.592-6731.592]	Thank
you. Secretary. Chris Nicholson	[6731.592-6732.746]	This is for
you. Secretary. Chris Nicholson	[6734.561-6742.382]	GM/CEO Johnson. Are there any plans in place or-- and please feel free to not answer this if
you. Secretary. Chris Nicholson	[6743.810-6749.578]	you can't. But I know there's been a drawdown over the last few years in our reliance on
you. Secretary. Chris Nicholson	[6749.958-6771.257]	Allied Security. Is there anything in this contract or in your planning around this contract or anything that can give us guidance on whether we expect that to continue after authorizing this, or are we expecting to stay at 90 something hundred or 180 people over the next
you. Secretary. Chris Nicholson	[6773.134-6773.134]	few years? Julien
you. Secretary. Chris Nicholson	[6773.134-6773.134]	Bouquet:
you. Secretary. Chris Nicholson	[6773.134-6773.134]	Ms. Johnson. Debra
Johnson	[6773.355-6774.472]	Yes. Thank you very much for
Johnson	[6774.778-6781.584]	the question. As Chief indicated, this is a contract extension and there's hours that are specified, hence in reference to the dollar amount that we
Johnson	[6781.850-6790.229]	have here. I would have to come back to the Board as it relates to any type of authorization as we're doing now currently with this contract extension, if that were to
Johnson	[6790.721-6794.181]	be modified. So on this point in time, it would stay
Johnson	[6794.527-6805.944]	the same. Unless there's some extenuating circumstances whereby we go out for a solicitation and we're not able to ensure that we're meeting the timeline before, since that's why we're here now with the
Johnson	[6806.290-6811.524]	contract extension. Quite naturally, in doing so, we have to ensure that we have the appropriate
Johnson	[6812.500-6817.178]	staffing levels. So I'm talking around and around in circles right now, but the answer would be no at this point
Johnson	[6819.014-6819.014]	in time. Julien
Johnson	[6821.477-6821.477]	Bouquet:
Johnson	[6822.839-6823.499]	Secretary. Perfect. Second Vice
Chair Whitmore. Troy Whitmore	[6823.720-6831.035]	So, Chief, jog my memory on our goal for the end of the year for
Chair Whitmore. Troy Whitmore	[6831.449-6832.305]	sworn officers. It's not
Chair Whitmore. Troy Whitmore	[6832.671-6833.783]	90, right? It's continuing
Chair Whitmore. Troy Whitmore	[6834.713-6835.452]	to grow. Julien Bouquet:
Chair Whitmore. Troy Whitmore	[6835.452-6835.452]	Chief Martingano. Steve
Martingano	[6835.732-6837.134]	Yeah. So we are budgeted
Martingano	[6837.874-6840.276]	for 150. We're still in the process of growing to
Martingano	[6842.587-6848.266]	those numbers. So obviously with applications, background checks, everything else, we're heading positively
Martingano	[6848.743-6850.527]	toward that. We're putting eight more in the academy here
Martingano	[6850.765-6852.892]	in June. We continue to get
Martingano	[6853.747-6856.944]	lateral transfers. I'm sorry, lateral applications from other agencies, officers
Martingano	[6857.671-6860.350]	with experience. So we're hoping to hit 150 goal by the end of
Martingano	[6860.593-6860.833]	the year. Troy Whitmore:
Martingano	[6861.094-6861.634]	All right. Thank you
Martingano	[6861.834-6863.988]	very much. I did have the right memory
Martingano	[6864.336-6864.796]	up here. Thank
Martingano	[6865.027-6865.027]	you,
Martingano	[6865.338-6865.338]	Mr. Chair. Julien
Bouquet	[6867.821-6869.905]	Absolutely. Any other-- well, any further questions or discussions
Bouquet	[6871.144-6871.517]	on this? Yeah,
Bouquet	[6873.546-6873.773]	Director Ruscha? Joyann Ruscha: Thank
Bouquet	[6873.967-6901.547]	you, sir. So I just wanted to note, in the past, upon request, the agency has provided a breakdown of how many-- just our security personnel from RTD to contracted and even break down in terms of with our contracted Allied force, like the ones that are authorized to have firearms versus not and our mental health staff
Bouquet	[6901.862-6907.844]	and stuff. So that's something that I think the agency-- I'm sure the agency would be happy to provide that
Bouquet	[6908.209-6919.874]	breakdown chart. I think it's been a little over a year since we've had one, so I just wanted to offer that to those who are interested and just to piggyback on Secretary
Bouquet	[6920.282-6920.733]	Nicholson's comments.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6921.203-6921.630]	Thank
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6924.287-6925.312]	you, Director. Any further comments
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6927.168-6927.168]	or
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6927.435-6927.702]	questions? OK.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6928.089-6929.737]	Seeing none. So I did have-- thank
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6930.813-6933.658]	you, Chief. I did have Nicholson as the mover and Ruscha as
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6934.418-6936.188]	the second. Are there any no votes on
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6940.667-6940.667]	this
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6941.101-6944.138]	item? OK. Seeing none, the item will pass
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6945.433-6949.462]	14-0-1 absent. We are hitting our two hour mark, so we are going to take a break for our
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6950.800-6953.756]	CART employee. Let's shoot to be back here
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6954.145-6954.706]	9 o'clock. Would that be
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6956.260-6956.260]	enough
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6956.620-6956.620]	time?
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6957.221-6957.221]	Nope?
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6957.441-6958.192]	OK. OK. Let's do
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6959.002-6959.273]	9:05, then. Chris Nicholson:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6959.563-6960.033]	Thank you. Julien Bouquet:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6960.524-6979.275]	Thank you. We'll be back
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[6985.792-6994.943]	at 9:05.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[7004.095-7127.234]	All right. Thank you, everyone, for
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[7204.588-7231.600]	your patience. We are now moving on to our next recommended action
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[7231.935-7242.990]	for tonight. And that is going to be the recommended action of the 2025-2028 Title VI program update to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[7243.325-7244.665]	of 1964. Do we have
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[7245.000-7246.005]	a motion? Peggy Catlin:
So moved. Julien Bouquet	[7246.340-7682.699]	I have Caitlin as
So moved. Julien Bouquet	[7683.059-7684.138]	the mover. Michael Guzman:
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7685.779-7692.956]	Guzman as
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7694.795-7698.963]	the second. I do understand that Director Benker has two amendments she would like to offer on
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7699.584-7701.893]	this item. Director Benker, we'll take your amendments one at
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7703.672-7705.338]	a time. What is your first amendment,
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7706.177-7706.793]	Director Benker? Karen Benker: Thank you
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7707.720-7717.019]	very much. And I'm glad everybody is now second wind and we're ready to go on to our, I don't know, six or seventh hour
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7718.220-7721.165]	of meeting. Actually, I will tell you, I
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7721.626-7722.636]	have three. We'll see how
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7722.908-7723.449]	things go.
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7724.992-7727.322]	They're short. The first one-- well, let me give you a little bit
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7728.478-7733.189]	of background. So the background is I met with my four cities back in February
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7733.506-7737.813]	and March. And of course, you meet with them and you say hi and you say, OK, what are
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7738.112-7738.744]	your needs? What are
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7739.995-7748.109]	your wants? I met with all of them, and they all gave me a list of basically trying to restore service that was removed during
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7749.828-7759.943]	the pandemic. And so of course, as is my job as Director, I'm trying to work with our staff to try to get that
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7761.224-7786.716]	service restored. And so one of my questions or issues is I am guessing that when the RTD Board had to make the hard decisions of how to cut service almost in half because of this highly unusual pandemic, perhaps some of these cuts were not done equally across all
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7787.438-7788.802]	15 districts. Julien Bouquet: Director Benker, I'm sorry
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7789.075-7794.532]	to interrupt. Just so that we keep an order, could we get a second on-- could you read the motion and then we get
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7794.705-7807.783]	a second? Karen Benker: The motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact from 10% to 20% as it relates to major service changes and consistent with the FTA
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7809.841-7816.852]	circular 4702.1b. And I believe the version that will be voted on is actually the version
Second, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[7817.156-7818.370]	that Mr. Kroll put up
for us. Julien Bouquet	[7819.755-7821.677]	So that's the language
for us. Julien Bouquet	[7822.017-7837.569]	right there. The first motion is to move to amend the 2025-2028 Title VI program update, such that the threshold for triggering either disperportionate burden-- or disparities in-- disparate impact finding-- late night-- finding arising from a major service change from 10%
for us. Julien Bouquet	[7839.613-7840.894]	to 20%. Do I have
for us. Julien Bouquet	[7842.115-7842.115]	a second? Brett Paglieri:
Second, Paglieri. Julien Bouquet	[7842.115-7843.091]	Paglieri is
Second, Paglieri. Julien Bouquet	[7844.397-7844.497]	the second.
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7845.488-7851.644]	So just to continue a little bit more background, and then we can start, I guess the
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7852.648-7859.905]	debate here. I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7860.490-7872.851]	the pandemic. And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7873.865-7895.211]	come out. And so I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic and perhaps do it a little bit quicker and also try to make it not quite
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7896.071-7903.104]	so difficult. So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the City and County
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7904.212-7914.825]	of Broomfield. And their transportation staff went through our items quite closely, and they sent us all a letter with
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7916.054-7925.562]	recommended changes. So I've gone through with their changes, and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the Board, see what your
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7926.790-7928.788]	thoughts are. Hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7929.514-7944.171]	what happens. But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7945.374-7950.592]	transit agencies. And so I did send you also a copy of the City and County of Broomfield's letter, just to refresh
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7951.842-7958.306]	your memory. And so I would like to put forth that the first amendment would be changing the threshold from 10%
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7959.030-7960.126]	to 20%. Julien Bouquet: Thank you,
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7960.652-7966.090]	Treasurer Benker. So again, the discussion right now is on the motion, this first motion, the
Thank you. Karen Benker	[7966.818-7967.229]	first amendment.
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7967.229-7971.696]	Thank
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7971.922-7971.922]	you,
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7972.768-7975.207]	Mr. Chair. I'd like to ask
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7976.374-7980.758]	GM/CEO Johnson. I heard from someone-- I don't remember now because it's
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7981.156-7987.134]	getting late. But someone said that some of those assumptions made by City and County of Broomfield
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7989.036-7989.036]	were incorrect. Julien
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7989.496-7989.496]	Bouquet:
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[7990.141-8010.114]	Ms. Johnson. Yes thank you very much relative to the comments that were made-- and thank you very much, Director Catlin-- as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned, being MARTA, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in greater Seattle, and the Chicago
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[8012.232-8020.818]	Transit Authority. That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there, this is not correct relative to where
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[8021.159-8035.152]	we sit. And more specifically, I do know our Director of Civil Rights, when we were going through this, quite naturally in the role that he is in, he and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[8035.494-8039.589]	transit agencies. So that's the communiqué that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[8039.930-8040.272]	this information.
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[8040.613-8043.685]	So, Mr. Green, if you want to just expound succinctly
Director Catlin. Peggy Catlin	[8044.495-8044.495]	and briefly. Carl
Green	[8044.867-8047.847]	Yes. Thank you so much, General Manager and
Green	[8048.220-8059.278]	CEO Johnson. To expand upon the response, I just also want to ground us and first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to
Green	[8060.215-8071.111]	service changes. And in doing that audit, we looked at 22-- rather, 23 different organizations, which includes the four, MARTA, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago
Green	[8071.570-8082.881]	Transit Authority. And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more
Green	[8083.486-8085.133]	sensitive, right? And ours is stacked in
Green	[8085.468-8087.177]	the middle. So I want to give you some
Green	[8088.132-8100.005]	numbers here. So for the four that I just mentioned, MARTA has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority
Green	[8101.472-8110.072]	has 15%. And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, 6 out of that 23 have 5%
Green	[8111.143-8111.690]	or less. Two
Green	[8113.045-8117.631]	have 8%. Six, which includes us, or seven including us, is
Green	[8118.458-8119.174]	at 10%. Three
Green	[8119.532-8120.964]	at 15%. And then three
Green	[8121.983-8140.352]	at 20%. And in my over eight years of doing this work, I'll just say that when you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve specifically with
Green	[8141.312-8146.544]	Title VI. Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or
Green	[8147.669-8154.715]	restoring service. There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and
Green	[8155.497-8166.650]	so forth. This is just a mechanism for the agencies such as RTD and the Board of Directors so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be
Green	[8166.989-8174.863]	transit reliant. So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of
our customers. Julien Bouquet	[8177.200-8179.074]	I have Director
our customers. Julien Bouquet	[8184.407-8184.407]	Ruscha next. Joyann
Ruscha	[8184.407-8191.225]	OK. I did have a question, but also Treasurer Benker had her hand up, and it was her motion, so I'm happy to wait if that was
Ruscha	[8192.234-8192.514]	in response. Julien Bouquet:
Ruscha	[8195.277-8199.738]	Treasurer Benker? Karen Benker: I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of
Ruscha	[8201.062-8209.856]	the pandemic. So how can we restore, let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several
Ruscha	[8210.693-8217.985]	years ago? How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had
Ruscha	[8219.368-8231.190]	that service? And so now we're being told that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to
Ruscha	[8232.786-8239.519]	have it. And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to
Ruscha	[8241.237-8241.237]	pre-pandemic levels? Julien
Ruscha	[8241.437-8241.437]	Bouquet:
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8241.437-8243.045]	Yes, thank you
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8243.277-8245.136]	very much. Director Benker, that question is better suited
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8246.164-8261.673]	for me. Relative to the service delivery framework that we have, while Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy services based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8262.040-8268.278]	service hours. But more specifically, at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8269.306-8278.328]	the SOP. When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were-- 85% of what service levels were
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8279.397-8288.070]	in 2019. We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8289.634-8299.310]	going forward. What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious in how we're applying service, because we do want to ensure there
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8299.671-8305.958]	is equity. I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8306.641-8316.783]	as well. As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8317.499-8319.747]	service change. That is up to the Board,
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8320.068-8340.305]	quite naturally. But I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service, keeping in mind that all transit agencies across the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8340.972-8346.023]	people power. Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8346.380-8356.168]	spare ratio. What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and in the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20%
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8356.776-8363.701]	spare ratio. We've deviated from that and have a waiver, and we're rightsizing the fleet as we
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8364.148-8371.493]	move forward. So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory, or were, and we're coming back
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8372.783-8384.643]	from that. We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area, from an origin and destination vantage point, just by virtue of how our service area is
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8385.519-8396.448]	going forward. So I'm not providing this to say I don't understand what you're trying to do, and as I share it with you, I do clearly, and we want to work within the framework that
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8396.828-8402.902]	we have. But a wholesale of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8403.362-8413.116]	fiscally responsible. And I say it from the vantage point of we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour, but that was out on
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8413.716-8416.816]	the street. Does that really yield the return on investment
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8417.281-8424.121]	going forward? Hence that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8425.220-8425.513]	going forward. Karen
Benker	[8425.513-8427.806]	OK. But if I can-- Julien Bouquet:
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8428.868-8432.440]	Some of the issues that you just raised
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8433.037-8433.452]	are important. There's
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8434.020-8437.844]	no doubt. However, I don't believe it goes to the
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8442.914-8458.277]	equity calculation. What I think is important to hear from staff-- and I know we're going to be talking about this at our retreat, which I'm looking forward to that-- is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8459.283-8478.393]	three years. What barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110, and start quickly-- or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8480.810-8480.810]	service levels? Julien
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8481.010-8481.010]	Bouquet:
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8481.010-8481.832]	Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson:
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8482.893-8486.174]	Thank you. There's a couple of external factors that play into that
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8486.504-8504.811]	quite naturally. When we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate in the lack of people commuting in, it's important to keep in mind that there was-- I'm forgetting the name, but the City and County of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8505.421-8514.206]	occupancy levels. But more specifically, what's important to note is that there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to the central
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8515.780-8526.222]	business district. I believe the last time I looked at stats, City and County of Denver was in the bottom three out of 50
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8526.660-8536.454]	major cities. And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number-- is the third state relative to remote work and then city of Boulder is
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8537.178-8544.573]	number one. While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8545.285-8554.007]	the pandemic. How do we get back to the transit usage that we
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8555.394-8582.792]	had before? I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair, and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8583.726-8610.945]	to delivery. And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power, we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available were people whereby were working extra shifts, and then we didn't have enough people for daily pull out on those
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8611.862-8620.393]	other routes. And so I'm providing that context to say, to get back, there are certain things that the agency can
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8620.778-8635.381]	surely do. But to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging, just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of
Treasurer, yeah. Karen Benker	[8637.854-8638.315]	this agency's. Julien Bouquet:
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[8638.315-8638.315]	Thank
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[8638.315-8641.294]	you, sir. So I have a question
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[8643.142-8652.701]	for legal. So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I-- I'm going to be careful with
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[8655.141-8664.676]	my words. Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[8665.357-8673.716]	comment process? Or is that something that we-- I guess I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area, and I wanted to get a bit of feedback
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[8674.422-8675.651]	on that. Not to disparage
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[8675.958-8678.722]	the motion. I just also want to understand the potential
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8684.175-8688.030]	I will address that question and then I'll
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8688.458-8689.315]	ask Mr. Green
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8689.823-8716.761]	to expound. I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think, pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference to the
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8717.690-8723.211]	public perception. There is leeway relative to the circular in light of what can
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8723.696-8736.435]	be done. We are sitting here on May 28, recognizing that we have a new administration and that we do need to have a Title VI program that's submitted, and we have been engaged on this topic
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8737.230-8739.608]	since January. That's not to negate any amendments or anything
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8739.953-8742.107]	like that. I am just trying to answer
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8742.665-8743.794]	the question. But more
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8744.170-8749.437]	specifically, Mr. Green, since you are very well versed in 4702.1b, would yield the floor
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8749.853-8753.579]	to you. And that's the citation for the FTA circular that we're
legal implications. Debra Johnson	[8754.359-8754.359]	talking about. Carl
Green	[8754.654-8756.426]	Yes. Thank you so much,
Green	[8757.522-8757.522]	GM/CEO
Green	[8759.024-8759.024]	Johnson.
Green	[8762.388-8762.388]	Oh.
Green	[8762.855-8764.050]	Apologies. Apologies. Julien Bouquet:
Green	[8764.291-8765.071]	Sensitive microphone. Carl
Green	[8765.622-8765.622]	Green:
Green	[8766.232-8792.336]	Yes. Apologies. But to piggyback off of what GM/CEO Johnson has noted, I would couch that as the bigger risk is when we think about establishing policy as it relates to 4702.1b, the FTA Title VI circular, it does call upon the agency to do a lot of outreach and public involvement to ensure that we are collecting that feedback to
Green	[8793.259-8806.322]	inform decisions. So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as
Green	[8807.760-8815.281]	the policy. But with respect to the circular, we can, i.e. the Board of Directors could adopt a
Green	[8815.757-8819.296]	different threshold. So, for example, the one that Director Benker has
Green	[8819.650-8836.518]	put forth. Although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update, there is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the Board is ultimately approving
Green	[8838.768-8838.968]	the policy. Julien Bouquet:
Green	[8840.009-8840.009]	Thank you.
Green	[8840.009-8840.009]	Director
Green	[8840.009-8843.279]	Ruscha? OK. Director Guissinger and then
Green	[8847.536-8847.536]	Director Larsen.
Green	[8847.536-8847.840]	Oh, perfect.
Green	[8848.144-8848.753]	Director Larsen. And
Green	[8851.219-8851.440]	then Harwick. Matt Larsen:
Green	[8853.221-8869.094]	Thank you. I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were for service changes, this Title VI analyses that were in the
Green	[8870.022-8890.488]	Board packet. And it seemed like most of the time-- sometimes there was a little bit of disparate impact on one route or the other, but mostly it sort of ended up that, in the aggregate, there wasn't really much, and there were legitimate justifications for what there was on an
Green	[8891.728-8899.937]	individual basis. I guess my basic question is with regard to this update and the changes that
Green	[8901.401-8903.962]	we're proposing. I mean, is there really a
Green	[8904.368-8906.261]	problem here? Are we just making this harder
Green	[8906.591-8917.297]	for ourselves? Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact, one place or
Green	[8917.785-8939.124]	the other. We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons, and on balance they don't really seem to, under our current setup, ever, ever look like they were somehow some bad intent or just inattention to who we
Green	[8939.581-8945.369]	are serving. It seems we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have
Green	[8946.059-8951.251]	done anyways. So why put a greater burden, regulate ourselves more than we
Green	[8951.597-8964.058]	have to? And why not just give us the freedom to operate as we would as much as we can, given that we don't-- it doesn't necessarily seem like it's been a problem for a
Green	[8964.404-8966.481]	long time? At least from what I
Green	[8966.848-8974.819]	could see. I mean, there weren't that many Title VI complaints in the information that
Green	[8975.725-8975.966]	was provided. I
Green	[8977.293-8980.131]	don't know. My basic question is, why would we make things harder
Green	[8980.751-8980.751]	for
Green	[8982.762-8983.057]	ourselves? Thanks. Julien Bouquet:
Green	[8983.351-8983.351]	Thank
Green	[8983.687-8983.687]	you.
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8983.687-8986.097]	Thank you
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8986.292-8997.773]	very much. The one thing I would share, Director Larsen, is we look at the modification that's been put forward for your consideration, like a 36 month period as we're adding
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[8998.156-9002.748]	back service. There could be unforeseen consequences as we do them in a
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9003.471-9006.655]	segmented fashion. And so that's one element as
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9007.109-9012.567]	a whole. Because if we're making modifications going forward, there could be an
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9013.340-9015.443]	adverse impact. And so that's what I would
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9016.524-9019.356]	showcase there. Keeping in mind to the point that
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9019.710-9028.207]	you raised. When we talk about the aspects of DIDB, it's what can we do as an agency to help mitigate that to your point
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9028.802-9040.532]	going forward. But it's just to ensure that we have a program whereby we are not causing undue harm to certain
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9043.158-9043.158]	population segments. Julien Bouquet:
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9043.158-9059.971]	But it just seems like, when I was reading the documents, that there's always a legitimate justification for everything we want to do or there's always this will have a disparate impact but we have a legitimate justification for doing this so we're just going to
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9060.797-9074.345]	do it. I mean, how many times in the last however many years has it been that we did this analysis, we looked at all the service changes we wanted to do, and we were like, OK, no, we're not going to do this list of
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9074.664-9080.522]	service changes. We're going to cross out these ones because the aggregate impact is
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9081.493-9083.188]	too much. I mean, does
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9083.435-9090.339]	that happen? I just didn't-- from what I read in the packet, I don't know if I caught everything, but it didn't seem like there were a lot
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9090.846-9103.838]	of those. Or is this happening at an earlier stage where when Bob and service says, let's just send a bunch of buses to Cherry Hills Village, somebody says, no, no, that's not going to work out, before it even gets to
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9105.399-9105.549]	this point.
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9108.102-9108.342]	You know? Debra Johnson:
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9109.323-9110.141]	I'm sorry. Thank you for
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9110.630-9116.767]	the question. For me, I've only been here for five years, and I came in the height of the pandemic, and we've been adding back service
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9117.413-9129.033]	and not. So that's difficult for me to answer just because we have not been in a situation whereby it's been
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9129.954-9131.911]	the opposite. Carl, do you have anything
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9132.838-9135.928]	to add? Carl Green: Yeah, I would just highlight, Chairman, if
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9136.502-9151.414]	I may. Since January 2023, there was about 270 service change recommendations that have been implemented, and roughly 24-26 of those 276 were considered major
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9152.508-9158.988]	service changes. And out of that 26, to Director Larsen's point, there has been 13 potential
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9160.301-9163.943]	disparate impacts. And to your point, there was a substantial
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9165.157-9178.871]	legitimate justification. I wouldn't necessarily couch it as an exercise, but I would say we work, the Transit Equity Office within the Civil Rights Division, works hand in glove with Jessie Carter and his team,
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9180.030-9193.482]	Service Development. And as we are having those conversations after the service change recommendation are put forth and we analyze it, if there is a potential disparate impact, more often than not, to your point and to my earlier earlier point, that Title VI is not a
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9194.294-9204.674]	stopping mechanism. And I wouldn't necessarily state that it's burdensome because it's one of our responsibilities to make sure that we are equitably distributing services across our
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9205.694-9212.885]	service area. But more often than not, there is a legitimate justification to put forth the service recommendation as it is presented to
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9215.941-9216.529]	the Board. Julien Bouquet:
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9217.116-9217.116]	Thank
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9219.827-9219.827]	you.
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9220.303-9221.372]	Director? OK. I had
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9221.728-9226.002]	Director Harwick. And just as a reminder, we're currently in discussion regarding this
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9226.438-9229.859]	first motion. Just want to make sure that-- first amendment,
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9230.201-9230.543]	excuse me.
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9230.905-9233.954]	First amendment. So make sure comments are
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[9234.430-9234.941]	around that.
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9234.941-9243.297]	Mine will be comments about this but also moving forward as well, because I am in support of this
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9243.879-9246.497]	Title VI. Not the amendment, just a straight
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9249.505-9258.277]	Title VI. I don't think moving from 10% to 20% is going to
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9259.091-9268.779]	increase ridership. I think that right now it allows our staff the ability to really center equity and effectively protect
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9269.369-9275.813]	our communities. And while I get that Broomfield feels like they want more service, I don't think this is going to get
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9276.758-9281.539]	it there. I think this is the 11th hour, and I think that it's really imperative that our staff has worked extremely hard
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9281.796-9289.256]	on this. They've had to jump through a whole variety of hoops for a bunch of different
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9289.583-9292.856]	Board members. And I think that we're here, they've done an
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9293.183-9301.691]	incredible job. And I think that this is-- they are the subject matter experts, and it's our opportunity here to put our trust in them, our belief
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9302.018-9304.309]	in them. And I think that we owe
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9304.636-9309.217]	them that. And we have been talking about this since January, so we're well into
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9309.544-9320.526]	four months. And I think that it is key that we support this Title Vi as is, and we allow them to move forward and we allow them to start handing this off to the feds and we can
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9321.037-9321.803]	move forward. That's where
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[9322.178-9322.319]	I'm at.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[9322.819-9323.886]	Thank
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[9324.419-9327.087]	you, Director. Any further conversation on
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[9327.620-9328.154]	this amendment?
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[9328.154-9332.422]	So this is for our deputy
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[9333.222-9344.979]	General Counsel. If we were to pass this tonight, what's the legal risk to the agency when it comes to our federal Title VI approval as a result of
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[9345.884-9357.593]	this change? Is this going to have any-- would this have any legal repercussions or could we just feel pretty comfortable that we could do this and not have the federal government take issue
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[9359.319-9360.437]	with it? Julien Bouquet: In regards to the
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[9361.222-9361.222]	amendment, Secretary? Chris
Nicholson	[9364.745-9364.745]	Yeah. Julien
Bouquet	[9364.745-9365.046]	OK.
Deputy Counsel. Melanie Snyder	[9369.252-9369.479]	There
Deputy Counsel. Melanie Snyder	[9369.613-9369.863]	we go.
Deputy Counsel. Melanie Snyder	[9370.931-9371.761]	Excuse me. Thank you,
Deputy Counsel. Melanie Snyder	[9373.005-9373.646]	Director Nicholson. I don't
Deputy Counsel. Melanie Snyder	[9376.785-9376.785]	have concerns. Julien
Bouquet	[9379.028-9379.389]	Secretary. Chris Nicholson: That
is all. Julien Bouquet	[9380.771-9381.523]	Yeah,
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9383.856-9389.370]	Here is where I do
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9389.983-9394.679]	not understand. In 2019, we had
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9396.359-9400.266]	the service. My area, my district, as many others,
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9405.177-9409.710]	have grown. For example, the town of Erie just a few years ago
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9410.087-9412.731]	was 20,000. Now it's 40,000 two, three
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9413.149-9420.819]	years later. And when I met with Erie, they said, hey, we're planning on going to 80,000 in just the next couple
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9421.943-9432.192]	of years. I also read in the Denver Post that the town of Erie is the 15th fastest city in the country in terms of
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9433.561-9448.682]	population growth. So my question is if we had this service prior to the pandemic and it was serving all of these communities, why is it so difficult to get
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9453.332-9453.642]	that restored? Julien
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[9453.642-9453.642]	Bouquet:
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9453.642-9459.718]	So thank you,
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9462.986-9482.191]	Director Benker. What I'm going to say goes back to the previous comments that I had before, recognizing that RTD is a regional service, and the way the service was outlined, for all intents and purposes, was bringing individuals into the central
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9485.121-9487.300]	business district. That level of ridership
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9487.736-9496.704]	isn't there. And that's not to negate that there is some elements centered on a need to move people to
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9497.161-9509.773]	and fro. Hence, that's why there was the advent of the partnership program and one of the reasons why Erie basically wanted to join the district, because they were looking to put forward an application for the
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9510.135-9546.104]	partnership program. And I know you're just using that as an example, but just wanted to further iterate that, because for all intents and purposes, as we're looking to provide mobility options, the intent behind the partnership program was more or less like a pilot in the sense that let's see how many people are utilizing this means of connection prior to putting out a 40 foot or 60 foot R tick that costs more money per revenue hour and doesn't yield the same return on investment relative to the cost
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9548.110-9550.651]	per boarding. Does that help or did I complicate
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9551.855-9551.855]	it
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9553.176-9553.176]	more?
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9554.518-9554.678]	No? OK. Julien Bouquet:
Ms. Johnson. Debra Johnson	[9555.099-9556.600]	Thank you. Director Guzman and then
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9557.661-9577.097]	So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight, getting back to the motion before us, I would like to ask one question, which is the 10% to 20% is still not going to prevent us from
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9578.028-9600.187]	adding services. It is simply a filter through which to look, if I understand this correctly, that we are not unintentionally harming community with protected status under the Title VI legislation, or those that might be disproportionately burdened or impacted by their financial and economic status within
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9601.830-9613.735]	the region. The only purpose we need to pass this is because it is due, because it is the law, and it is how we ensure that we are able to receive our federal funding, which is approximately 25% of our
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9615.240-9617.828]	total budget. So I just want to make sure
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9618.475-9623.327]	I understand. What has been presented here does not tell the Board, no, we cannot provide
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9624.471-9647.929]	transit service. It is simply a way to look at it and say, we may have an issue if it reaches a certain threshold that we need to be aware of in order to be able to approve changes in service, fare changes, or other changes that would create a potential burden on specific communities as defined within the Title
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9648.563-9652.496]	VI language. Is that correct, or am I completely lost in
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9654.711-9655.328]	this conversation? Carl Green: Chair, OK
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9655.832-9656.106]	for me? Julien Bouquet:
Director Guissinger. Michael Guzman	[9656.379-9656.379]	Absolutely,
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9656.379-9663.470]	If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear, and if you have any double back, then I'll respond
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9664.208-9704.872]	to it. So the current 10%, so if we think about different thresholds for DIDB and we are in-- based off of the desk audit, we're in the middle tier of having a threshold that allows us as an agency, which ultimately each service equity analyses is approved by the Board of Directors, where it allows us-- again, to your point, when we're thinking about BIPOC or Black, Indigenous, people of color for disparate impact or low income communities for disproportionate burden, it allows us to make a well-informed, eyes-wide-open decision of better understanding of who's more likely to receive more of
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9705.308-9713.608]	the impact. And when we're thinking about service increases, we're thinking about the fair share of benefits where if there is a service reduction, we're looking at who's more likely to receive more of
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9714.400-9723.675]	the burden. So to your point, Director Guzman, it allows us to just get a better understanding of the level of impact that we can have on a
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9724.423-9726.683]	particular community. It does not prevent us from
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9729.089-9729.269]	moving forward. Michael Guzman:
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9730.230-9736.330]	Thank you. I would just urge a no vote, and let's move on to
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9737.700-9737.941]	the policy. Julien Bouquet:
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9738.982-9743.505]	All right. Director Guissinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this
specific amendment. Lynn Guissinger	[9744.061-9744.932]	I'll be
specific amendment. Lynn Guissinger	[9745.553-9746.799]	super quick. That last explanation
specific amendment. Lynn Guissinger	[9747.110-9751.159]	that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of just giving us a better
specific amendment. Lynn Guissinger	[9751.490-9758.947]	holistic view. But I shared Director Larsen's view of, are we just making this harder for ourselves, creating
specific amendment. Lynn Guissinger	[9761.062-9761.663]	more work? Is that
specific amendment. Lynn Guissinger	[9763.445-9763.445]	not right? Julien
specific amendment. Lynn Guissinger	[9763.676-9763.676]	Bouquet:
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9763.676-9765.879]	Yeah, that's a great follow
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9768.698-9781.510]	up question. I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when we think about what we're ultimately trying to achieve and a percentage that's mathematically consistent relative to the populations that
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9782.498-9807.519]	we serve. So in doing this work, given my background, and doing an assessment of whether if we-- and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is with doing this work or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyzes, 20% is something where you wouldn't
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9809.226-9822.607]	see anything. And that's a disservice when we think about our populations within our service area, specifically, as we look at our Census data, where 38.1% is BIPOC, 13.1%-- or 14.1%, rather for
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9823.028-9823.028]	low
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9823.568-9827.486]	income. Right? And then if we look the onboard survey, 56% are
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9828.813-9849.241]	considered BIPOC. And so I say all that to say, just to wrap it up, is that 10% threshold for DIDB allows us to make an informed decision that is backed by not only our desk audit, but the years of experience and knowing, having a better understanding of ultimately what we're trying
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9852.179-9852.550]	to achieve. Lynn Guissinger:
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9852.940-9853.100]	Thank you. Julien Bouquet:
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9853.780-9855.042]	Thank you. All right, let's do a roll
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9855.482-9865.254]	call vote. As a reminder, it is the first amendment being introduced, as you all can see on that screen, with Director Benker as the mover and Director Paglieri as
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9865.711-9867.976]	the second. Again, we're voting on this
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9869.174-9869.475]	first amendment.
Mr. Green. Carl Green	[9870.636-9870.636]	Treasurer Benker. Karen
Benker	[9871.677-9872.503]	Yes. Julien Bouquet: Director Buzek
Benker	[9873.558-9873.909]	is gone.
Benker	[9875.841-9875.841]	Director Catlin. Peggy
Catlin	[9876.901-9877.502]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Catlin	[9880.725-9880.725]	Director Guissinger. Lynn
Guissinger	[9882.183-9882.684]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Guissinger	[9883.024-9909.223]	Director Gutschenritter. Chris
Gutschenritter	[9909.223-9909.223]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Gutschenritter	[9909.223-9909.223]	Director Guzman. Michael
Guzman	[9909.223-9909.223]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Guzman	[9909.223-9909.223]	Director Harwick. Ian
Harwick	[9909.223-9909.223]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Harwick	[9909.223-9909.223]	Director Larsen. Matt
Larsen	[9909.223-9909.223]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Larsen	[9909.223-9909.223]	Director Nicholson. Chris
Nicholson	[9909.223-9909.223]	Yes. Julien Bouquet: First Vice
Nicholson	[9909.223-9909.223]	Chair O'Keefe. Patrick
O'Keefe	[9909.223-9909.223]	No. Julien Bouquet:
O'Keefe	[9909.223-9909.223]	Director Paglieri. Brett
Paglieri	[9911.900-9912.434]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Paglieri	[9912.611-9912.967]	Director Ruscha. Joyann
Ruscha	[9913.145-9915.856]	No. Julien Bouquet:
Ruscha	[9916.380-9917.429]	Director Whitmore. Troy
Whitmore	[9919.278-9920.821]	No. Julien Bouquet: I'm a yes, but the motion
Whitmore	[9920.821-9920.821]	will fail. And we have 3
Whitmore	[9920.821-9920.821]	to
Whitmore	[9920.821-9921.072]	10. OK.
Whitmore	[9921.563-9921.863]	Moving on.
Whitmore	[9922.204-9924.075]	Yes, Director? Karen Benker: I would like to withdraw the next
two amendments. Julien Bouquet	[9924.771-9925.238]	Next
two amendments. Julien Bouquet	[9925.592-9925.592]	two amendments? Karen
Benker	[9926.495-9927.477]	Yes. Julien
Bouquet	[9927.477-9929.676]	OK. The next two amendments have
been withdrawn. Chris Nicholson	[9931.373-9933.898]	They were never introduced, so they're not
been withdrawn. Chris Nicholson	[9934.378-9939.420]	really withdrawn. But now you would return back to the debate on the main motion, which is to approve the Title VI
been withdrawn. Chris Nicholson	[9940.102-9940.102]	program update. Julien
Bouquet	[9941.025-9942.091]	Excellent. Back to the main motion
Bouquet	[9942.831-9943.162]	at hand.
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9945.008-9951.670]	So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9952.316-9954.585]	this action. There's a few things
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9955.099-9957.975]	going on. First of all, it should never get to the
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9958.783-9963.586]	last minute. The Board should never be asked to pass things because it's due in
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9964.249-9968.182]	two days. And I know there's a lot of things that go into
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9968.510-9975.905]	the delay. But that's just not the right-- that's not the right urgency to place on the Board
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9977.667-9984.390]	to act. Secondly, I don't know very much about this topic, and I have sat in on two operations
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9986.166-9987.214]	committee meetings. I've talked to a bunch
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9987.449-9989.598]	of people. I've done my
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9990.115-9994.999]	own research. And I still am looking for a succinct description of
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[9995.464-10000.567]	the program. I would note that there was a wonderful book written by
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10001.092-10001.990]	Robert Caro. It's called The
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10002.455-10004.512]	Power Broker. I'm sure a lot of people in this room
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10005.439-10019.551]	know it. Talks a lot about bad policy decisions on disadvantaged communities and how those decisions were made and the harmful outcome of
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10021.619-10025.524]	those decisions. It is 15 pages shorter than our
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10026.582-10035.520]	packet tonight. He won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1,200 page treatise on impact by
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10036.178-10048.077]	public infrastructure. I would request that when we're passing along documents as part of a packet, it needs to have a point, and it should be summarized from the committee for the rest of
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10048.418-10052.855]	the Board. Simply passing things along for us does not help me understand
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10053.265-10061.429]	this better. I'm probably a yes vote tonight, but I was a no vote until about an hour and a
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10061.817-10073.868]	half ago. And so just, when you are putting together packets on complex questions for the Board, giving us reams of paper does not help us get to a
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10074.978-10087.395]	better decision. So that's something, a request for the two, three-ish Committee Chairs as you're putting together topics like this, and that would be very helpful for me to make
Director O'Keefe. Patrick O'Keefe	[10088.267-10088.267]	better
decisions. Thanks. Julien Bouquet	[10088.848-10089.539]	Thank you,
decisions. Thanks. Julien Bouquet	[10090.531-10092.330]	Director O'Keefe. Any further comments or questions on the
decisions. Thanks. Julien Bouquet	[10093.597-10093.897]	main motion?
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10093.897-10104.384]	I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously submitted a proclamation for RTD on May
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10105.094-10106.429]	19, 2025. It is in the
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10107.357-10128.692]	director's emails. It was sent over by City Council, that they wholeheartedly support the 2025-2028 Title VI program to include the proposed updates to major service change, disparate impact, and fare equity policies, as well as updates to RTD's public participation plan and language access plan, which we are voting on now, and that the clerk and recorder of the City and County of Denver did affix the seal, making
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10130.300-10131.572]	it official. I believe that that
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10131.847-10132.703]	is necessary. There's a
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10133.289-10134.941]	whole proclamation. You can read
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10135.354-10144.027]	through it. But former Board Director Lewis-- sorry, We had two Lewises and I wanted to make sure I said
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10145.482-10149.642]	it right. Did work with city council member Serena
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10150.104-10155.001]	Gutierrez Gonzalez. And the unanimity of that vote is remarkable from our
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10155.489-10158.653]	city council. So they stand behind this as well with us to move
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10158.937-10159.097]	this forward.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10159.919-10160.550]	Thank you,
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10161.542-10161.893]	Director Guzman.
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10163.647-10171.421]	I'm going to be a no vote, I think it's kind of, like I said, we're constraining our freedom
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10171.756-10174.506]	to operate. We're spending a lot of energy and effort to
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10175.161-10188.405]	track this. And I know the intentions behind that are good, but I think, just as a matter of principle, we shouldn't be trying to over-- regulating
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10189.282-10209.694]	ourselves more. We should be thinking, there's not really a lot of evidence that we have disparately or ever had any recent plans to expand service or decrease service in a way that causes a disparate impact on
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10210.616-10225.333]	these populations. And I honestly believe that if we focused 100% just on increasing ridership, which is what I think we should be doing, and not trying to expand our purview about when maybe we shouldn't
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10225.782-10226.207]	increase ridership. I
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10227.481-10228.755]	don't know. If it's legitimate, we'll do
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10229.318-10244.095]	it anyways. I really think if we were focusing strictly on increasing ridership, we would actually-- it would all be disparately impacted in favor of all the communities we're worried about, just based on the way population is distributed in
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10244.514-10259.348]	the area. And I would like for us to move towards a paradigm of focusing much, much more on increasing ridership across the board and less on finding possible reasons to not
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10261.015-10261.833]	increase ridership. So I'll be a
Director Larsen. Matt Larsen	[10262.017-10262.017]	no
vote. Thanks. Julien Bouquet	[10262.960-10263.592]	Thank you,
vote. Thanks. Julien Bouquet	[10263.883-10264.304]	Director Larsen.
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10264.304-10274.491]	So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session, and a town hall, all on
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10275.310-10285.614]	this topic. And I should say expertly facilitated by our co-chairs and by our Chair of Finance and
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10286.500-10291.890]	our staff. And I feel like I'm just starting to get a decent understanding
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10292.772-10300.092]	of it. I came into this knowing nothing about this, and I was an absolute no when we
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10300.563-10303.856]	first started. And my public remarks made that
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10304.426-10315.746]	very clear. But I want to commend staff and our Board leadership who were willing to indulge because I came to
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10316.697-10317.803]	understand it. I came to understand what it
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10318.221-10319.304]	was for. I came to understand how
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10320.608-10328.433]	it works. And I don't necessarily agree with all of it and I think we could use more data in addition to the data we have now to
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10329.843-10331.606]	determine this. But if we don't pass this, we lose
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10332.167-10334.157]	federal funding. So there's a good reason to pass it even if you don't
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10335.873-10340.273]	like it. But on top of that, I just think our staff did
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10341.121-10345.795]	their jobs. They have demonstrated to me this is the right thing to do, despite
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10346.370-10347.965]	my skepticism. And so I'm definitely voting for
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10348.814-10348.984]	it tonight. Julien Bouquet:
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10349.595-10350.762]	Thank you. Any further comments on the
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10352.337-10352.337]	main
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10352.587-10355.591]	motion? OK. Seeing none, we had Catlin as the mover and Guzman as
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10356.362-10360.338]	the second. There is indication that there will be no votes so I will be doing a roll call vote

Bouquet	[10425.662-10425.792]	Yeah? Joyann Ruscha:
Bouquet	[10426.343-10426.840]	Oh, wait. Well, I could
Bouquet	[10426.984-10428.875]	be wrong. I'm sorry, I forgot we
Bouquet	[10429.347-10430.294]	started late. I thought we hit our four
Bouquet	[10430.909-10433.273]	hour mark. Please
Bouquet	[10434.475-10434.475]	ignore me. Julien
Bouquet	[10434.835-10434.835]	Oh. Joyann
Ruscha	[10434.975-10436.282]	Sorry. Julien Bouquet: Guzman is
Ruscha	[10436.778-10437.844]	the mover. Whitmore is
Ruscha	[10441.599-10442.441]	the second. Any discussion
Ruscha	[10443.702-10444.263]	on it? Yeah,
Ruscha	[10444.263-10449.371]	Director Paglieri? Brett Paglieri: I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting
Ruscha	[10450.814-10466.385]	for this. I was not necessarily sure how this would further the clean energy and zero emission goals of the State of Colorado and therefore will just be
Ruscha	[10466.936-10467.106]	voting no.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10469.652-10470.606]	Any
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10471.083-10471.560]	further conversation?
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10471.560-10477.382]	Yeah, so I understand the importance of what we're
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10479.313-10484.027]	doing here. I think that these buses in particular-- in my religion, there's
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10484.444-10486.012]	a thing. Why is this night different from all
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10486.248-10488.404]	other nights? Why are these buses different from all
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10489.902-10500.764]	other buses? These are going to be the flagship of our flagship BRT line, and if these suck, it will
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10502.118-10516.342]	kill BRT. And if they are not comfortable, if they are not just awesome in every way possible-- you can make a lot of choices when you buy a bus about how nice it's going to be in the same way can make a lot of choices about how when you buy a car, about how nice it's going
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10516.497-10525.632]	to be. And so I just want to lean in here, and I do have one question to say that we need to pull the
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10526.113-10540.374]	stops out. We need to make sure we're giving you enough money, GM/CEO Johnson, to make sure we're buying top of the line, to make sure that these are things that when they run through my district, people go, wow, I want to get
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10540.705-10542.452]	on that. Not, wow, that doesn't look
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10543.480-10551.684]	very nice. And so my question for you is, how do you know that the amount of money that we're authorizing today is enough to get top of
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10552.008-10562.785]	the line? And how many bites at the apple are we going to get to make sure that you are buying the right buses for this incredibly
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10564.421-10564.421]	important project? Julien
Bouquet	[10564.641-10568.119]	Ms. Johnson, is 51 million enough to make them
Bouquet	[10568.525-10568.525]	not suck? Debra
Johnson	[10570.160-10572.133]	Yeah. So thank you very
Johnson	[10572.527-10575.235]	much, Mr. Chair, and thank you for
Johnson	[10576.285-10576.765]	the question. Julien Bouquet:
Johnson	[10577.266-10577.634]	My apologies. That
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10577.819-10581.816]	Keep it in mind, this is a
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10582.240-10588.309]	budget transfer. And full transparency, Director Nicholson emailed me about this because I think there was some confusion about where
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10588.876-10590.248]	we are. There is yet to be
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10590.537-10591.995]	a solicitation. There's yet to
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10592.739-10602.039]	be specifications. So these monies that are being transferred or needed for all intents and purposes so we can start
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10604.694-10607.364]	a procurement. Now, keeping in mind there's a couple
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10608.038-10615.874]	of elements. These buses have to be dedicated because this is designated as a bus rapid transit project as defined by the Federal
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10616.670-10621.811]	Transit Administration. There are certain criteria that we have to ensure that we
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10622.298-10629.088]	adhere to. This will be a dedicated fleet just by virtue of the configuration of BRT, with it being a center
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10629.965-10651.066]	running platform. So when you talk about it being top of the line, that's yet to be seen in reference to what we had before us, because there's only two original equipment manufacturers in the United States, there's only so many suppliers, there are certain seats, and there is a national task force on which I sit, where we're talking about doing away with customization, because that
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10651.632-10655.405]	increases prices. I bet you don't know how many shades of white there is with new
was unprofessional. Debra Johnson	[10655.676-10655.676]	flyer industries. Chris
Nicholson	[10656.216-10656.877]	24. Debra Johnson:
Nicholson	[10657.557-10657.557]	How many? Chris
Nicholson	[10657.678-10657.678]	24. Debra
Johnson	[10658.999-10660.508]	23. I think I told you
Johnson	[10660.841-10671.276]	that earlier. So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this, we're going to do our due diligence and we're going to ensure it's a
Johnson	[10671.649-10677.984]	competitive solicitation. And we do understand the aspects, because that's what separates bus rapid transit from general fixed
Johnson	[10679.258-10679.478]	route service.
Johnson	[10680.337-10680.337]	Thank you. Julien
Bouquet	[10680.826-10687.285]	Secretary. Chris Nicholson: I really appreciate it and I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how the purchase
Bouquet	[10689.931-10689.931]	is going.
Speaker	[10690.472-10690.911]	Yes. And
Speaker	[10690.911-10691.350]	what white. Julien Bouquet:
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10691.789-10692.667]	Just
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10693.545-10701.009]	really quickly. With regards to this, moving this money from the unrestricted fund is simply to begin the
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10701.969-10705.513]	procurement process. And although it's not part of the 2025 budget, we do need to get started
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10706.828-10726.263]	on it. However, I would suggest that as we go forward, these buses are meant to be purchased in finality by 2027 to begin this service, and that is work that we will dutifully do on Finance and Planning to ensure that it is included in all necessary documents that come before this Board
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10727.546-10730.144]	for approval. And I am certain that our new CFO is up to the task
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10730.430-10733.784]	on that. So rest assured, Directors, we're not wantonly
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10734.203-10740.264]	spending money. But we do need to authorize this for the procurement of the buses at
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[10740.596-10740.929]	this point.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10741.261-10741.926]	Thank
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10742.258-10743.920]	you, Director. Any further discussion on
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10744.252-10744.584]	this item?
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10744.917-10746.578]	All right. There is a no--
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10746.911-10747.243]	oh, no.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10747.575-10753.890]	Sounds good. All right, it was indicated there will be a no vote, so I will do a roll
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10754.222-10758.543]	call vote. Again, this is the budget transfer articulated buses supporting Colfax
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10758.875-10759.207]	BRT service.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[10759.540-10760.307]	Treasurer Benker. Karen

Director Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[10775.211-10775.211]	go brr. Peggy
Catlin	[10775.932-10777.535]	What? Chris Nicholson: Sorry that was a bad internet
ref-- yes. Julien Bouquet	[10778.977-10779.593]	Nicholson is
ref-- yes. Julien Bouquet	[10779.879-10780.329]	a yes.

Ruscha	[10790.109-10791.520]	Director Whitmore. Troy
Whitmore	[10793.523-10793.523]	Yes. Julien
Bouquet	[10793.603-10796.195]	OK. So that passes 12, 1,
Bouquet	[10797.528-10797.678]	and 2.
Bouquet	[10797.868-10798.295]	All right. Thank
you, folks. So we have one-- Jack Kroll	[10798.569-10802.003]	Chairman Bouquet, could you remind us
you, folks. So we have one-- Jack Kroll	[10802.372-10806.069]	over here? We missed who the mover and the seconder were
on that. Julien Bouquet	[10806.799-10807.585]	I had Guzman
on that. Julien Bouquet	[10808.281-10808.281]	and Whitmore. Jack
Kroll	[10808.381-10808.532]	OK.
Kroll	[10809.403-10809.553]	Thank you. Julien Bouquet:
Kroll	[10810.578-10810.578]	Thank
Kroll	[10811.479-10811.479]	you.
Kroll	[10812.308-10813.433]	OK. Excellent. Thank you all again for
Kroll	[10813.661-10819.199]	your patience. We do have one more item, and that is the equitable transit oriented development
Kroll	[10820.929-10839.971]	policy amendment. So for the Board of Directors to approve the amendment to resolution number two, series of 2021, which created the equitable transit oriented development policy that permits and encourages the development of affordable housing on RTD real property in order to include guidelines for disposing of RTD real property below fair market value
Kroll	[10840.739-10841.268]	or rent. Do we have
Kroll	[10841.600-10842.522]	a motion? Michael Guzman: So
moved, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[10842.522-10843.108]	Guzman is
moved, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[10843.343-10843.808]	the mover. Do we have
moved, Guzman. Julien Bouquet	[10843.808-10843.808]	a second? Ian
Harwick	[10844.445-10845.397]	Second. Julien Bouquet: I have Harwick as
Harwick	[10847.550-10852.544]	the second. I do understand that on this item, we have some proposed amendments from Director Nicholson and
Harwick	[10853.780-10857.351]	Director Ruscha. Since Director Nicholson's amendment was circulated to the Board first, we will
Harwick	[10858.247-10860.757]	start there. Director Nicholson, please now make your motion
Harwick	[10861.675-10861.675]	to amend. Chris
Nicholson	[10862.181-10866.230]	Yes. I'd like to move to amend the
Nicholson	[10866.736-10869.773]	ETOD policy. And I'm hoping that GM/CEO--
Nicholson	[10869.773-10870.279]	not GM/CEO.
Nicholson	[10870.785-10875.340]	That Mr. Kroll can put up that language on
Nicholson	[10876.808-10877.019]	the screen. Speaker:
Nicholson	[10877.890-10879.774]	It's there. Chris
Nicholson	[10879.774-10879.914]	Great.
Nicholson	[10881.470-10884.037]	May I? Julien Bouquet: Would you like to read the motion and then we'll get
Nicholson	[10884.374-10884.555]	a second? Chris Nicholson:
Nicholson	[10884.775-10884.775]	Thank
Nicholson	[10885.315-10894.768]	you. Yeah. So move to amend the policy such that Section 5 of the equitable transit oriented development policy regarding negotiated land price be updated
Nicholson	[10895.132-10928.443]	as follows. To raise the maximum negotiated land price discount to 75% from 50% and add the following additional factors to favorably consider projects which include more accessible units than required by law, limit residential parking, are deeply affordable, emphasize priority groups as identified by the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, and incorporate smaller footprint retail, including below market rate units-- below market rate retail, excuse me, that prioritizes local businesses
Nicholson	[10929.125-10929.125]	and entrepreneurs. Julien
Bouquet	[10933.271-10933.847]	Excellent. Jack Kroll: Do we have
Bouquet	[10933.847-10934.077]	a second? Julien Bouquet: And do we have a second
Bouquet	[10934.793-10934.793]	on that? Ian
Harwick	[10935.454-10936.111]	Second. Julien Bouquet: Harwick is
Harwick	[10938.458-10940.003]	the second. Secretary, would you like to
Harwick	[10940.281-10940.471]	discuss further? Chris Nicholson:
Harwick	[10940.682-10940.682]	Thank
Harwick	[10941.222-10953.246]	you. Yes. Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll to briefly describe the five pieces of written public comment that we received on this recommended action from some of our local
Harwick	[10954.083-10954.083]	public officials. Jack
Kroll	[10954.453-10961.845]	Yes. So four of the written public comment items were submitted by individuals specifically supportive of the change Director Nicholson
Kroll	[10962.255-10971.532]	is offering. And those four individuals were the mayor of Boulder, a city council member from Boulder, a city council member from Westminster, and the Colorado Cross
Kroll	[10971.869-10985.484]	Disability Coalition. And then the fifth letter was submitted by SWEEP in joint with Conservation Colorado and Denver Streets Partnership, which spoke more broadly to the overall changes being offered
Kroll	[10988.799-10988.799]	this evening. Julien
Kroll	[10989.110-10989.110]	Bouquet:
Kroll	[10989.881-10990.482]	Perfect. Secretary. Chris Nicholson:
Kroll	[10991.204-10992.456]	Thank you. And thank
Kroll	[10992.456-10993.291]	you, Mr. Executive
Kroll	[10994.465-10996.971]	Manager Kroll. So here at RTD, we make lives better
Kroll	[10997.610-11000.971]	through connections. Tonight as a Board, we have an opportunity to do that in a particularly
Kroll	[11002.076-11003.724]	powerful way. Our rider surveys tell a
Kroll	[11004.500-11010.828]	clear story. Over half of our passengers live below 200% of the federal poverty level, and they are far less likely to own
Kroll	[11011.870-11018.321]	a car. Our riders with disabilities use RTD at disproportionately high rates, as do other vulnerable populations in
Kroll	[11018.680-11025.225]	our community. Yet only a fraction of affordable housing developed near our stations truly meets the needs of our most
Kroll	[11026.250-11029.929]	dedicated riders. Communities in our state have struggled to create housing targeted at
Kroll	[11030.636-11037.076]	our ridership. Inclusionary zoning has mostly led to housing at 60% AMI, about $51,000 a year
Kroll	[11037.525-11045.877]	in earnings. This housing is necessary, but priced well out of reach for someone making only $31,000, which is 200% of the federal
Kroll	[11046.237-11055.251]	poverty line. This amendment empowers RTD to deepen our land discount offerings up to 75% to incentivize projects specifically tailored to the actual economic realities of
Kroll	[11056.273-11057.750]	our riders. Here's how that can work
Kroll	[11058.016-11064.808]	in practice. Just this month, Denver Health donated the land to create Tapestry, a deeply affordable, accessible, transit- oriented
Kroll	[11065.627-11074.339]	housing project. It supports a range of affordability from 30% to 80% as well as far more three bedroom and even four bedroom units than most affordable projects being
Kroll	[11075.456-11081.943]	built today. It targets accessibility because distance to transit is a major barrier for people with disabilities to
Kroll	[11082.703-11091.178]	use transit. This holds for all types of disabilities, and unfortunately, painfully few class A fully accessible units exist in the RTD
Kroll	[11092.143-11096.667]	service area. By creating greater incentives for developers, we can do a lot to play our part in
Kroll	[11097.082-11103.248]	fixing that. It's late, so I won't go through the argument for reduced parking and service of CFHA's
Kroll	[11103.892-11105.352]	priority populations. You all have an email from me with
Kroll	[11106.015-11112.184]	that data. But I do want Director Harwick to speak after me to address the language, he added on smaller footprint and below
Kroll	[11113.285-11119.336]	market retail. Community is about more than housing, and I enthusiastically added his language for the reasons
Kroll	[11119.947-11124.244]	he'll highlight. This framework recognizes that we are not the housing
Kroll	[11125.195-11143.799]	policy experts. It increases the scope of our tools and trusts our staff to use them effectively to bring us thoughtful projects, projects that align with our strategic priority of community value and enable us to grow ridership by putting the people who most need transit where they can best be served
Kroll	[11144.665-11146.485]	by it. I ask your support for
Kroll	[11147.469-11147.579]	this amendment. Julien Bouquet:
Kroll	[11147.710-11147.870]	Thank you.
Kroll	[11149.512-11149.512]	Director Harwick. Ian
Harwick	[11149.900-11157.665]	Yeah. So I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD, that we're really thinking also about mixed
Harwick	[11158.053-11166.759]	use TOD. And I'm wildly in favor of anything that we can do to bring more housing, let alone affordable housing, to our park
Harwick	[11167.019-11173.246]	and rides. I do think it's really key that we also think about what are the businesses that we are bringing
Harwick	[11173.557-11184.455]	in there. And having spent a lot of time working at Starbucks and a good friend of mine works at Starbucks, I'm also really in favor of coffee shops like Prodigy and
Harwick	[11184.766-11201.764]	smaller shops. But also thinking about when I've traveled to travel to other communities throughout the world, there oftentimes are smaller retail shops that give young entrepreneurs that opportunity to start a business and not be burdened by a larger footprint that some of our larger restaurants or larger retail
Harwick	[11202.139-11204.009]	shops can. They can cover
Harwick	[11204.383-11223.498]	those costs. So this, to me, was a way to encourage local businesses to start up or expand give them the opportunity in a place that we all-- when we go to a park and ride and there's not something there to grab that quick bite to eat, I want to give them that opportunity, everyone
Harwick	[11223.774-11225.430]	that opportunity. One to shop there and
sell there. Julien Bouquet	[11227.089-11227.690]	Thank you,
sell there. Julien Bouquet	[11228.632-11229.868]	Director Harwick. Any further discussion on
sell there. Julien Bouquet	[11231.217-11231.507]	this amendment?
sell there. Julien Bouquet	[11232.082-11232.336]	Director Ruscha? Joyann
Ruscha	[11232.590-11234.112]	Mr. Chair, maybe you can help
Ruscha	[11234.446-11238.176]	me here. So I had a comment, but I had a comment on the
Ruscha	[11238.443-11239.509]	main motion. But we moved
Ruscha	[11240.216-11245.798]	to amendments. But recognizing that Secretary Nicholson's language can't exist without the motion language or the way
Ruscha	[11246.346-11248.011]	it's drafted. May I just make a
Ruscha	[11248.310-11249.194]	general comment? Does that
Ruscha	[11249.391-11252.244]	make sense? It would apply to both, but I don't know if I would be called out
Ruscha	[11252.422-11252.779]	of order. And
Ruscha	[11253.779-11254.313]	I'm tired. I will do what
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11254.520-11254.787]	You
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11255.081-11255.291]	know what?
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11255.562-11256.347]	Why not? Let's give it
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11256.564-11257.015]	a try. Joyann Ruscha:
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11257.445-11257.956]	OK, thanks. I'm doing
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11259.088-11270.058]	my best. So this morning, we got an email from staff that addressed some outstanding questions that I still had, just so I knew what I was
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11271.040-11280.571]	voting on. And the issue-- I have heartburn over just the main motion because the way
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11281.252-11287.889]	it's written. We, as a Board, are not just expanding the bounds of what a
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11288.246-11297.508]	policy is. We're also signing away 30 plus years of precedent of having this guardrail that says, before you go dispense a real property, get our
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11298.484-11305.790]	preliminary authorization. So I am already a little
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11306.855-11321.619]	bit uncomfortable. And also the policy says that if a developer, as it relates to housing, cannot meet our 50% standard, they could still get a major discount and it could be millions and millions
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11322.496-11327.496]	of dollars. And so those two combined and just recognizing that these deals take a long,
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11327.830-11328.830]	long time. They're not
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11330.645-11333.890]	summer projects. In some, it means that all of that is going
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11334.185-11339.199]	to happen. And then it's going to come back to the Board when all of those decisions have
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11340.986-11357.793]	been made. So for that, because I'm struggling with the original proposal, but I can accept it for now, is why I can't vote yes on Secretary Nicholson's amendment, because we don't have guardrails that I
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11358.224-11360.884]	would prefer. So I hope that was not out
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11361.089-11363.337]	of order. And if it was, thanks for not calling me out
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11363.561-11363.742]	of order. Julien Bouquet:
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11364.202-11365.324]	Thank you. Thank you,
you say. Julien Bouquet	[11365.324-11365.594]	Director Ruscha.
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11365.594-11373.100]	So ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee, and this is
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11376.302-11390.587]	my concern. Although I am with you in spirit-- deeply affordable housing is really important-- I'm not sure that giving an additional 25% discount in our policy is wise for a number
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11391.605-11396.039]	of reasons. I do believe, however-- and maybe Madam CEO
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11396.572-11398.334]	or Ms. Chessy Brady might be able to speak
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11398.554-11398.995]	to this. I'm
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11401.058-11408.011]	not sure. What we were asked for in this policy was to give guidelines to begin negotiation that would eventually come back to
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11409.539-11421.234]	this Board. Let's say a developer comes to us and just brings us an amazing proposal that includes everything that you could want in a development
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11421.722-11443.061]	and more. I don't see why they wouldn't necessarily come back to us and say, hey, they're willing to do all of these things-- they being staff-- and asking for an additional amount of up to whatever amount makes sense to give that discount from the Board that we would consider properly and then be able to authorize in
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11444.244-11450.406]	that moment. But in order to begin the process, we were simply asked to give authorization for them to work within
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11450.774-11456.871]	a parameter. That way, there was no confusion that they would be able to do a 30% to 50% discount as was written in the
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11457.626-11465.913]	original policy. Beyond that, the Board would still have authority, as I understand it, if we were asked to offer an additional discount
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11466.888-11484.319]	for more. I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former Directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11484.796-11486.559]	the agency. And so I would like to ask
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11487.265-11502.983]	that question. Is there anything that would prevent you from coming back to us if we were to receive such an excellent proposal that prevents you from saying, can we receive an additional discount to offer a developer, Board, and would you approve this so we can make a
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11504.967-11504.967]	project work? Julien
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11505.167-11505.167]	Bouquet:
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11505.382-11508.663]	Ms. Brady. First off, thank you for your patience and greatly appreciate you sticking
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11508.993-11509.213]	around tonight. Chessy Brady:
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11509.774-11510.414]	Of course. Julien Bouquet:
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11511.376-11511.546]	You're recognized. Chessy Brady:
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11512.357-11515.033]	Thank you. No, there is nothing that would stop us from
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11515.762-11521.153]	doing that. As you say, the point of the policy is to create guardrails and certainty within
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11522.231-11534.731]	those guardrails. We would use the opinions of the Board to guide developers towards what we think the Board would be interested in, as we're negotiating with them, and we come back to the Board for approval of any
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11535.906-11536.076]	given project. Karen Benker:
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11537.047-11537.798]	Thank you. One more
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11538.388-11548.783]	quick thing. And Director Benker, Treasurer Benker, the sales and the lease income from our real estate properties are put into a
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11549.298-11550.051]	specific account. Can you guess
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11550.979-11564.216]	which one? Because when we deeply discount things beyond where we should, we are saying no to the potential income that we could use for operations and maintenance and service provision elsewhere in
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11565.147-11572.331]	the agency. So on balance, real estate and real property are a finite resource and dollars can be
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11573.515-11583.703]	stretched thin. But how we use the opportunity to either receive money to prolong and serve the public further is a huge consideration
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[11584.386-11588.810]	in this. So although I am with you in spirit, I would be voting no on the amendment as it is
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11589.711-11591.273]	Thank
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11591.273-11591.744]	you, Director.
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11592.481-11592.681]	Director Paglieri. Brett Paglieri:
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11592.881-11593.282]	Thank you. I'll
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11594.563-11598.950]	be brief. I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11600.068-11601.456]	agree with. I am a little bit concerned about
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11601.670-11603.969]	two things. The first is the language
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11604.813-11608.741]	deeply affordable. It's a little bit ambiguous, if I'm saying
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11610.118-11616.138]	that right. And I think using language like that can-- what's to say they
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11616.568-11618.718]	discounted $100? To some, that's a
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11619.148-11620.438]	deep discount. To others,
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11620.848-11628.319]	that's nothing. So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can define
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11629.279-11631.207]	it elsewhere. But I do want to leave
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11631.502-11638.421]	this language. And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11639.352-11656.150]	I want. And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75% But this is our property, and I really would like to see it sold for the highest value to
right now. Julien Bouquet	[11656.772-11656.952]	benefit all.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[11657.152-11658.433]	Thank
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[11659.094-11659.385]	you, Director.
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11661.657-11662.828]	Just a
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11663.739-11670.366]	quick question. Some of the surplus properties that we're talking about, we are not including our current park
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11670.756-11670.756]	and
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11672.147-11678.159]	rides. Correct? Would be excess land, perhaps around a park and ride, but not one of our park
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11679.758-11680.279]	and rides.
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11681.560-11681.800]	Just clarification. Chessy Brady:
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11682.061-11685.514]	Thank you. So this policy is aimed at transit
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11686.487-11691.423]	oriented development. So property that RTD owns at transit stations or near high
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11692.182-11698.257]	frequency transit. Excess property and surplus property are definable terms that perhaps Michelle could help
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11698.637-11704.711]	us with. But those are distinctive properties that the Board has named to be excess
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11705.531-11708.065]	and surplus. And so I just want to separate that from a park
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11708.256-11710.042]	and ride. A park and ride is certainly not excess
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11711.081-11712.876]	or surplus. It may have
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11713.525-11726.927]	underutilized land. It may have a large drainage area that is part of the park and ride, but not every development that we would consider on a park and ride would remove parking, if that's getting more to
Treasurer Benker. Karen Benker	[11728.090-11728.441]	your question. Karen
Benker	[11728.441-11728.441]	OK. Chessy
Brady	[11731.275-11731.776]	Yes. Julien Bouquet:
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11731.776-11735.586]	I actually have some questions
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11736.493-11736.493]	for
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11737.454-11741.871]	Ms. Brady. So first off, Director Paglieri raised the concern about the term
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11742.859-11747.264]	deep affordability. I think you and I know what that means, but maybe the rest of the Board doesn't, given it's a term
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11747.505-11750.729]	of art. Can you elaborate on what that's
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11751.929-11751.929]	referring to? Julien
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11752.130-11752.130]	Bouquet:
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11752.130-11753.191]	Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady:
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11753.671-11761.292]	Sure, yes. Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means generally 30% to 40%
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11762.159-11766.937]	of AMI. It is squishy, I think still, but generally it's understood to mean 30%
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[11767.338-11767.338]	to 40%. Julien
Bouquet	[11769.905-11770.949]	Secretary. Chris Nicholson: So
Bouquet	[11771.471-11776.692]	second question. I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as
Bouquet	[11778.896-11782.945]	a discount. I was hoping maybe you could speak to the-- because I mentioned it a
Bouquet	[11783.215-11790.503]	little bit. But as someone who's an expert in the space, and I will say you and I worked pretty closely together on this language and went back
Bouquet	[11790.773-11792.123]	and forth. You did a meeting
Bouquet	[11792.473-11794.609]	with me. So this isn't just something that I
Bouquet	[11794.956-11798.884]	wrote myself. This is something that got vetted pretty heavily
Bouquet	[11800.229-11815.267]	by staff. What impact does a greater discount have on the types of projects that, in the affordable housing space, you tend to see people able
Bouquet	[11815.909-11829.316]	to build? At least from where I sit, the reason for doing this is that when it comes to those deeply affordable, which are deeply subsidized units, when it comes to things like units that are fully accessible, those
Bouquet	[11829.947-11836.037]	are expensive. They cost developers money, which is why, when you don't have those subsidies, those units don't
Bouquet	[11836.455-11847.862]	get built. I think it's about half the projects that are in the CHFA Database have zero units at 30% AMI, and very few of them have anything with regard
Bouquet	[11848.328-11854.150]	to accessibility. So I'm hoping you can maybe elaborate on-- you're the one who would be using this tool at the end of
Bouquet	[11854.433-11858.787]	the day. How do you see it coming in handy with regard to what you're able
Bouquet	[11859.698-11860.976]	to do? And then I have one last
Bouquet	[11862.981-11866.804]	follow up. Julien
Bouquet	[11869.116-11869.116]	Bouquet:
Bouquet	[11873.804-11875.856]	Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady:
Bouquet	[11878.650-11882.211]	Thank you. So affordable housing projects are notoriously difficult
Bouquet	[11883.337-11889.034]	to finance. And I think if you use the example earlier of Tapestry and
Bouquet	[11889.414-11893.591]	Denver Health. Denver Health, as you stated, as I assume it's correct, donated the land
Bouquet	[11894.011-11897.745]	for Tapestry. I can assure you that development was still very difficult
Bouquet	[11898.937-11908.332]	to finance. So even if we were giving the land at 100% discount, the projects would still not pencil, in
Bouquet	[11909.400-11931.193]	many cases. And so our ability to discount the land to 75% as the Board prefers, in many cases, could get us over the hump from a project not being built to a project being built, and to that project having more affordable units as opposed to a higher, more of a middle
Bouquet	[11931.905-11934.290]	income range. And that's the difference that the land
Bouquet	[11934.949-11939.548]	discount makes. And that's the certainty that this policy helps me bring to conversations
Bouquet	[11940.255-11945.207]	with developers. Gets them in the mindset of we're going to get some help here
Bouquet	[11946.342-11948.573]	from RTD. We can focus on deeper
Bouquet	[11948.965-11954.160]	affordability units. We can make bigger promises to CHFA or other financing entities that host
Bouquet	[11955.192-11958.310]	in Denver. And it helps us keep the
Bouquet	[11959.659-11961.124]	projects moving. And I'll be frank
Bouquet	[11962.096-11966.567]	with you. As I said, Tapestry, even with 100% discount, it's still hard
Bouquet	[11967.066-11968.668]	to do. This is not a
Bouquet	[11969.269-11974.719]	silver bullet. But it moves the needle and it helps us actually keep projects afloat and get to the
finish line. Julien Bouquet	[11975.399-11975.693]	Thank
finish line. Julien Bouquet	[11975.880-11975.880]	you,
finish line. Julien Bouquet	[11976.461-11979.547]	Ms. Brady. We're going to wrap up with Director O'Keefe and then
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[11980.307-11981.767]	Oh, I thought I got
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[11982.682-11985.102]	last word. So I support
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[11985.848-11996.368]	this amendment. I think it is a reasonable step toward developing communities that are very likely to use
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[11997.743-12002.228]	our services. I think increasing ridership is something we all
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12002.508-12004.453]	agree on. This is a concrete way to
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12005.873-12015.431]	do that. It also takes land not just for our benefit in ridership, but also puts improvements on it that helps the
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12016.307-12031.160]	tax base. And I think the communities that we serve would rather see a housing project end up on that property where it becomes improved versus
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12031.688-12032.804]	somewhere else. We're not the only game
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12033.030-12034.421]	in town. There's a lot of discounts
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12034.674-12040.715]	out there. And so we're not necessarily in a tight
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12041.486-12043.499]	buyer's market. There's a lot of projects that can
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12044.452-12052.556]	go forward. And I think we need to put our best deal, and at least give Chessy and the rest of the team the tools to bring the
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12052.848-12054.502]	deal forward. I do want to put
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12055.153-12055.785]	one plug-in. We talked
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12056.296-12060.797]	about it. I don't think ground leases are the best tool
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12061.287-12064.396]	in Colorado. First of all, it's not as common as other places in
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12065.296-12073.038]	the world. And the other thing is, toward the end of your ground lease, no matter how long you make it, the property will fall
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12073.773-12078.709]	into disrepair. They are not going to put money into physical facilities that are going to roll off
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12079.680-12086.547]	their books. So for that reason, the discount's great and I love a sale versus a
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12086.949-12089.042]	ground lease. And I know you'll keep that in mind as we
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12089.953-12097.522]	go forward. And anyway, that's another argument in favor of
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12100.182-12100.182]	that tactic. Julien Bouquet:
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12100.182-12100.423]	Director Larsen. Matt Larsen:
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12101.284-12102.744]	Thank you. I'm going to be a no vote
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12103.286-12108.281]	on this. I don't agree with our transit oriented development policy as it is
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12108.834-12115.206]	right now. I don't agree with the goal of trying to provide affordable housing or encourage it,
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12115.984-12119.553]	incentivize it. I think we should be focused on trying to
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12120.070-12134.747]	increase ridership. If we want to provide discounts on our land, we should provide them with the goal in mind of increasing the number of people that can live on the property, whatever is developed, and the amount of traffic that is on
Director Larsen. Patrick O'Keefe	[12136.212-12138.264]	the property. So I'm a no
on this. Julien Bouquet	[12139.355-12140.015]	Thank you,
on this. Julien Bouquet	[12140.396-12140.536]	Director Larsen.
on this. Julien Bouquet	[12141.116-12144.791]	All right. With the indication there is a no vote, I am going to do a roll
on this. Julien Bouquet	[12145.040-12147.869]	call vote. As a reminder, we are voting on Director
on this. Julien Bouquet	[12148.683-12152.747]	Nicholson's amendment. He was the mover and Director Harwick is the second

Sorry, no. Julien Bouquet	[12182.227-12183.365]	And finally, Second Vice
Sorry, no. Julien Bouquet	[12183.365-12184.210]	Chair Whitmore. Troy
Whitmore	[12185.317-12188.427]	Yes. Julien Bouquet: And I am
Whitmore	[12189.049-12195.891]	a yes. That amendment will pass 10, 2-- excuse me. 10, 3,
Whitmore	[12198.697-12201.308]	and 2. Yes. 10 yes, 3 no,
Whitmore	[12201.743-12203.049]	2 absent. That is
Whitmore	[12204.105-12204.105]	the
Whitmore	[12204.482-12204.859]	math. OK.
Whitmore	[12205.236-12210.137]	Moving on. We are going to do our second amendment, which was brought forward by
Whitmore	[12211.979-12215.121]	Director Ruscha. And Director Ruscha, would you like to introduce the language of
Whitmore	[12217.286-12224.862]	the amendment? Joyann Ruscha: It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman, and I-- Michael Guzman: I can make
Whitmore	[12225.716-12225.716]	the
motion. Sorry. Joyann Ruscha	[12226.197-12227.387]	I think he has the language in front
motion. Sorry. Joyann Ruscha	[12227.919-12228.239]	of him. Julien Bouquet:
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12228.239-12229.572]	Thank
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12229.817-12229.817]	you,
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12230.102-12256.032]	Mr. Chair. We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end of this policy that says, additionally, no project will be eligible for any discounts unless it complies with the greater of the following. 5% of all units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, and an additional 2% of all units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities, or two, current US Department of Housing Urban Development
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12258.755-12259.380]	accessibility requirements. Do we have
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12260.579-12263.229]	a second? We have Ruscha as
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12263.229-12263.229]	the
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12263.496-12263.953]	second. Mr. Kroll,
I'm sorry. Jack Kroll	[12264.464-12272.761]	Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the highlighted portion above would
I'm sorry. Jack Kroll	[12273.176-12275.665]	be deleted. And is not included in
I'm sorry. Jack Kroll	[12277.241-12277.241]	your
I'm sorry. Jack Kroll	[12277.241-12277.241]	motion. Correct? Michael
Guzman	[12279.985-12283.337]	Correct. Julien Bouquet: So the language we see, this would substitute
Guzman	[12284.311-12284.712]	the language?
OK, perfect. Michael Guzman	[12285.452-12287.886]	Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get
OK, perfect. Michael Guzman	[12289.778-12290.039]	this done. Julien Bouquet:
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12291.764-12296.325]	I was happy to speak to the motion, but I wasn't sure if we were--
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12296.950-12297.190]	I'm tired. Is
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12298.411-12298.656]	that OK? Julien
Bouquet	[12298.656-12298.656]	Mhm. Joyann
Ruscha	[12298.656-12302.331]	OK. Julien Bouquet: We got Guzman as the mover and Ruscha as the second, and we're up
Ruscha	[12302.636-12302.816]	for conversation. Joyann
Ruscha	[12302.816-12303.372]	OK. Julien Bouquet: You're up,
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12303.917-12304.264]	Thank
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12304.458-12304.458]	you
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12304.946-12309.336]	sir. OK. So just for everyone's edification, we struck the
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12309.884-12311.500]	first sentence. It was a two
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12311.904-12320.322]	sentence amendment. Just recognizing that we didn't have full staff concurrence on the first sentence, which would have applied this accessibility minimum to market
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12321.557-12325.467]	rate housing. And sometimes you shoot for the stars and land on
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12326.843-12333.607]	the moon. The second sentence, which just applies to the HUD requirement to affordable housing, we did get
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12335.292-12336.543]	staff concurrence. That was the context
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12338.595-12344.554]	behind that. I sent out like a Q&A, frequently asked questions in anticipation of
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12344.885-12348.198]	some questions. So I'm happy to entertain any or we can
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12349.029-12369.943]	address them. I will say that we worked for three weeks and some change on this with housing advocates and folks who had worked in the space, and people had worked at CHFA and at the state level on similar policy and advocacy organizations and then staff
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12370.790-12374.040]	and legal. So, I mean, just--
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12374.690-12375.990]	I'm sorry. I
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12377.290-12395.214]	am tired. In case anybody has any questions about what this is, I think it just simplify it and say that HUD has a current minimum accessibility requirement
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12396.389-12400.151]	for funding. And it's 5% of units are accessible to persons with
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12400.493-12404.597]	mobility disabilities. Additional 2% of units are accessible to persons with hearing or
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12405.740-12410.260]	visual disabilities. And so a lot of times in these projects, that HUD requirement is going to
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12410.543-12413.085]	kick in. But not all projects are going to have
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12413.969-12420.183]	HUD dollars. So just recognizing that a lot of jurisdictions take that HUD standard, which is--
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12420.494-12423.885]	maybe Ms. Brady can correct me, but I think it's 20 plus years, 30 plus years
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12425.439-12429.384]	old now. And they also incorporate that into their policies or their code
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12430.043-12430.749]	or statute. We did
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12431.454-12432.631]	the same. Good for goose, good
Director Ruscha. Joyann Ruscha	[12433.627-12438.784]	for gander. I will stop there unless anyone else has further questions
or comments. Julien Bouquet	[12440.314-12441.999]	Questions or comments on
or comments. Julien Bouquet	[12443.677-12446.592]	this amendment? Director Catlin, then
Secretary Nicholson. Peggy Catlin	[12447.571-12471.277]	I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the first amendment that we passed does give a lot of latitude towards Chessy and her staff to negotiate, and I fear that this one might be a little bit too regulatory
Secretary Nicholson. Peggy Catlin	[12473.542-12483.096]	and prescriptive. And if that's the HUD requirement and somebody is applying for a HUD grant, then this would be taken care
Secretary Nicholson. Peggy Catlin	[12484.175-12492.824]	of automatically. So right now, I'm willing to listen to other discussions, but I fear that it would not
Secretary Nicholson. Peggy Catlin	[12493.326-12500.046]	give Ms. Brady and her staff the maximum flexibility to look at the comprehensive merits of
Secretary Nicholson. Peggy Catlin	[12503.309-12504.337]	a proposal. Julien Bouquet:
Secretary Nicholson. Peggy Catlin	[12504.871-12504.871]	Yeah,
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[12506.312-12506.673]	Would you like me
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[12506.673-12518.858]	to comment? So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver already requires, for example, and the Colorado Department of Housing is already considering a higher threshold
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[12519.427-12521.950]	of requirement. So I have no concerns about
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[12522.290-12525.712]	incorporating this. I think it's already going to be taken care of in
most cases. Peggy Catlin	[12526.375-12527.036]	If
most cases. Peggy Catlin	[12527.366-12528.688]	I might? That's kind of
most cases. Peggy Catlin	[12529.118-12530.436]	my point. It seems a little
most cases. Peggy Catlin	[12534.190-12534.591]	bit redundant. Julien Bouquet:
Secretary Nicholson. Chris Nicholson	[12534.591-12538.924]	I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's
all right. Julien Bouquet	[12540.844-12541.218]	To
all right. Julien Bouquet	[12541.606-12541.806]	the Amendment? Chris Nicholson:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12543.249-12544.434]	Just to clarify, that was
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12544.672-12546.258]	a question. You would like to offer an amendment to
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12546.817-12548.681]	the amendment? Chris
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12548.842-12548.842]	Nicholson:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12549.002-12549.378]	Yes. Sub-amendment. Julien
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12550.099-12550.099]	Bouquet:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12550.840-12558.636]	Mr. Kroll? Jack Kroll: Technically, the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy, and this is an amendment to
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12559.026-12566.432]	that amendment. And at this point would be amending an amendment to an amendment, which is not allowed under
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12566.822-12571.110]	Robert's Rules. So you would need to tackle this amendment as it's
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12571.500-12580.832]	being presented. And then, if you feel so inclined, offer an amendment to whatever or whatever state the policy is in at
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12581.971-12582.420]	that point. Julien Bouquet:
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12582.868-12582.868]	Rock
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12583.769-12583.769]	on. Secretary. Chris
Nicholson	[12584.086-12588.833]	Yeah. So at that point, I would say I'd have to be a no for the very
Nicholson	[12589.150-12601.477]	simple reason. Where it says no project will be eligible, we're talking about an equitable TOD policy here, which is specifically focused on using our land to facilitate the-- literally the policy is about
Nicholson	[12602.439-12608.862]	giving discounts. I can't see putting something like this in there unless it is related to
Nicholson	[12609.310-12616.786]	said discount. So I'd be fine if it said, additionally, no project receiving a discount will be eligible for any discounts, et cetera, unless it
Nicholson	[12617.181-12623.509]	complies with. But I don't necessarily think it makes sense to do market rate policy in an
ETOD policy. Julien Bouquet	[12623.905-12624.696]	Thank
ETOD policy. Julien Bouquet	[12625.882-12627.860]	you, Secretary. Treasurer Benker and then
Director Ruscha. Karen Benker	[12628.471-12629.462]	Just
Director Ruscha. Karen Benker	[12629.973-12640.086]	real quick. Have you perhaps considered something more positive, saying something along the lines, greater consideration would be given a project if these items
Director Ruscha. Karen Benker	[12640.507-12642.614]	were attained? As opposed to make
it mandatory. Julien Bouquet	[12646.040-12647.322]	Director Ruscha or
Director Guzman. Karen Benker	[12647.662-12649.746]	Again, sort of an amendment, but just
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12650.807-12654.537]	So I just want to address what Secretary
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12655.707-12663.426]	Nicholson said. I might have missed part of the closed captioning, but I think you said you don't think we should be applying accessibility minimums to
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12664.676-12664.676]	market
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12665.237-12665.528]	rate. OK.
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12666.038-12666.198]	That's exactly.
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12666.659-12667.392]	We don't. So this amendment doesn't
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12667.940-12668.713]	do that. And the
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12669.228-12680.816]	second piece. The reason why it doesn't say it doesn't reference discounts is because-- so this goes at the end of the policy, which is all-- the way it's nested under the paragraph, this is talking about when discounts apply, if that
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12683.753-12686.673]	makes sense. It does what you said you wanted it
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12687.037-12687.544]	to do. It's
a thought. Joyann Ruscha	[12688.518-12688.779]	just late. Julien
Bouquet	[12688.779-12689.430]	Nicholson. Chris Nicholson:
Bouquet	[12690.020-12693.959]	Thank you. And then I guess the only question I have for-- and this is actually
Bouquet	[12694.225-12695.351]	for Ms. Brady, if
Bouquet	[12696.984-12707.671]	that's OK. Because you mentioned that Denver has a policy that supersedes or that matches this, and the state currently is considering a policy that would supersede it, but currently
Bouquet	[12708.509-12712.114]	does not. Under what circumstances would this have any effect
Bouquet	[12713.081-12720.381]	at all? In what circumstances can you imagine in your professional capacity do you see this being something that
Bouquet	[12721.869-12721.869]	would matter? Julien
Bouquet	[12722.069-12722.069]	Bouquet:
Bouquet	[12722.069-12723.110]	Ms. Brady. Chessy
Brady	[12723.553-12729.058]	Yes. In a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units-- and Director Ruscha has
Brady	[12729.334-12732.649]	mentioned some. I'm not aware of them, but this is not my area
Brady	[12733.275-12751.308]	of expertise. But in a jurisdiction that does not already have those requirements, that is not accepting HUD money, and, if Colorado Department of Housing changes their rules, does not accept department of housing money, then that project would then be subject to this
policy requirement. Julien Bouquet	[12753.665-12753.945]	Thank
policy requirement. Julien Bouquet	[12754.125-12754.125]	you,
policy requirement. Julien Bouquet	[12754.726-12754.726]	Ms.
policy requirement. Julien Bouquet	[12755.117-12756.388]	Brady. Secretary. Chris
Nicholson	[12756.817-12759.823]	Yeah. Just, I guess for Director Ruscha or
Nicholson	[12760.252-12767.551]	Director Guzman. Are there any jurisdictions in the RDD service area that don't have that same requirement that
Nicholson	[12769.951-12770.341]	Denver does? Julien Bouquet:
Nicholson	[12772.154-12772.154]	Either Directors. Joyann
Ruscha	[12772.447-12776.549]	Yeah. I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53
Ruscha	[12776.902-12784.771]	separate jurisdictions. So I'm just going to have to lean into this is ETOD and the E in it
Ruscha	[12785.735-12790.897]	is equitable. We spent a lot of time talking about equity today, including spending a significant amount of time talking about people
Ruscha	[12791.664-12817.762]	with disabilities. And so just, again, recognizing that the HUD requirement is about equity and not excluding people on the basis of disability from accessing affordable housing, because the Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and other areas of anti-discrimination law, including state law, don't effectively cover
Ruscha	[12819.444-12821.098]	that aspect. Sorry, that was more than what
Ruscha	[12821.334-12835.202]	you asked. But no, I can't answer your question, just like you probably couldn't answer my question about every single jurisdiction in the RTD region that has something regarding
Ruscha	[12835.853-12836.694]	parking minimums. It's a
broad concept. Julien Bouquet	[12838.355-12838.911]	Thank you,
broad concept. Julien Bouquet	[12839.536-12841.254]	Director Ruscha. Any further conversation on
broad concept. Julien Bouquet	[12842.739-12843.089]	this amendment.
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12843.089-12846.834]	I will offer this last thing, and then we probably should go to
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12847.143-12856.260]	a vote. But very simply put, we need to make sure that we are protecting
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12857.414-12863.007]	the vulnerable. Providing access to these housing units, even in the City and County of Denver's building codes, is
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12863.378-12864.374]	not clear. It's as clear
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12864.991-12870.859]	as mud. There is reference to this if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12871.218-12879.663]	necessarily required. We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12880.688-12892.031]	get licensed. And so, to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units, I would like to see this in
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12892.810-12905.893]	the policy. I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this, to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12906.287-12909.944]	that's established. And although it is established in other places, it is not established in
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12910.205-12918.230]	our policy. And we are the government of this region and we should take it seriously that we have a due diligence and responsibility to those members of our community that would
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12918.719-12918.859]	need this.
Director Guzman. Michael Guzman	[12920.242-12920.562]	Thank you. Julien Bouquet:
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12920.562-12924.680]	I always have to follow you,
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12924.979-12926.175]	Director Guzman. But obviously, I'm very
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12927.108-12939.126]	in support. Any time that we can be supportive of our communities most in need, those suffering from a whole variety of disabilities, I want to be able to put our best foot
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12939.962-12950.987]	forward there. And while we can't call out specific jurisdictions, if there is that chance that there is a jurisdiction that isn't meeting this requirement, then we should make sure we're
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12951.555-12956.790]	getting there. And if in the process the state comes up with something better or something in the future,
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12957.061-12963.762]	that's OK. But I think that this is like a safety net in my mind about how to really get there for
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12964.066-12982.616]	this community. And I think that also, as we're tying-- as these developments spur up around our transit, that's also giving them better access to the resources and giving them that the life that they want and the freedom of movement that we
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12983.048-12984.439]	so cherish. So I'm highly in support
Director Harwick. Ian Harwick	[12985.192-12985.552]	of this.
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12985.933-12987.583]	Secretary, less than
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12987.976-12991.195]	30 seconds. Chris Nicholson: This question is
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[12992.261-12999.642]	for Chessy. My understanding with this language is that it applies to buildings with elevators
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[13000.269-13015.074]	in it. And so with single stair buildings, that there are different policies around equitable access because of the challenges, obviously in a single stair building, of getting people into the second, the third, the fourth, the
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[13015.617-13018.250]	fifth floor. You're probably the biggest expert on this in
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[13019.726-13030.383]	the room. Do you see any concerns with this language when it comes to buildings with stairs only
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[13031.716-13031.716]	versus elevators? Julien
Thank you. Julien Bouquet	[13031.716-13031.716]	Bouquet:
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[13031.716-13041.134]	I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable-- I do know that equitable access and accessible units are different things and have
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[13042.249-13045.281]	different requirements. And so we're talking specifically about
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[13047.946-13055.288]	accessible units. We're tending to be talking about larger buildings because we do want them to be dense at stations, so I think they're typically going to be
Ms. Brady. Chessy Brady	[13055.506-13057.471]	elevator buildings. But yeah, I don't have any concerns
about that. Julien Bouquet	[13058.070-13058.297]	Thank
about that. Julien Bouquet	[13058.450-13058.450]	you,
about that. Julien Bouquet	[13059.211-13060.446]	Ms. Brady. Let's do the roll

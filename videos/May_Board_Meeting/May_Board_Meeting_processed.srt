1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,534
SPEAKER_10: Comments, feel free to come up to the podium.

2
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:08,381
SPEAKER_10: Seeing none, were there any emailed comments, Mr. Carroll?

3
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:09,262
Larsen: There were a number.

4
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:12,466
Larsen: I am not going to go through all 46 and read the names.

5
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:19,575
Larsen: However, you received 36 letters with respect to Northwest Rail and the IGA conversation that you held earlier today.

6
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:24,341
Larsen: Five letters with respect to the ETOD policy you will consider later this evening.

7
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:29,667
Larsen: Three letters with respect to Title VI policy or the program update.

8
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:42,896
Larsen: You all will consider later this evening, one regarding the National Women's Soccer League proposed stadium that was discussed earlier here in person, and one regarding paratransit AOD program modifications.

9
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:45,961
Larsen: All will be appended to the transcript of this meeting.

10
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:59,080
Larsen: And just as a reminder to directors, a majority of these written public comments were submitted to the RTD.directors email group, which you all have access to and can see in real time.

11
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:00,740
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Mr. Krull.

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,105
SPEAKER_10: With no other participants in the queue, we will now close public participation at this time.

13
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:09,009
SPEAKER_10: Moving on to our next item, external entities report.

14
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,533
SPEAKER_10: We have no external entity reports this month.

15
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:16,137
SPEAKER_10: Moving on to our next item, discussion items.

16
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:23,245
SPEAKER_10: We have one discussion item on the agenda this evening, which is a holdover from last week's operation safety and security committee meeting.

17
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:27,008
SPEAKER_10: It is the access on demand program modifications.

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,583
SPEAKER_10: I would like to offer the floor to GM CEO Deborah Johnson for some opening remarks before introducing Ms.

19
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:34,405
SPEAKER_10: Vallejo's.

20
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:37,331
SPEAKER_16: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

21
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:42,583
SPEAKER_16: Good afternoon or evening, board members, Deborah Johnson, general manager and chief executive officer.

22
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:51,572
SPEAKER_16: I am joined by Aaron Valleos, who serves as the Acting Assistant or Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations.

23
00:01:52,033 --> 00:02:05,196
SPEAKER_16: And as indicated in your remarks, we are here referencing the previous agendized topic at the Operations Safety and Security Committee that we did not get to and wanted to have this conversation.

24
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:34,879
SPEAKER_16: with you all this evening, the intent of this presentation is to ground all board members in our paratransit programs, but more specifically, what we are seeking from this body is some guidance relative to access on demand, which is a supplemental premium service as relates to paratransit services, not the American with Disabilities Act of 1990, Complementary Paratransit Services.

25
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:40,708
SPEAKER_16: And in doing so, this conversation will help us guide our path forward.

26
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:51,966
SPEAKER_16: Specifically, I think what's notable for everybody to understand that the current paratransit contracts that we have for access on demand do sunset at the end of December.

27
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:57,795
SPEAKER_16: We have had conversations relative to modifications and absence of having some guidance

28
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:09,491
SPEAKER_16: We run the risk of not having any type of services and hence why it's so imperative is that we adhere to open and fair competition in order to do a solicitation relative to services.

29
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:17,522
SPEAKER_16: We have to have some guidance relative to the specifications that would be included in a solicitation for a request for proposal.

30
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:25,673
SPEAKER_16: So this is not for you to make a decision relative to where we are but provide guidance because what we anticipate doing with said guidance

31
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:30,938
SPEAKER_16: and bringing forward these scenarios after meeting with some board members, i.e.

32
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:47,432
SPEAKER_16: Chair Ruscha and Director Chandler, that are both on the Operation Safety and Security Committee, is to seek that direction so we can then go out to the customer segments and garner a better understanding.

33
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:54,158
SPEAKER_16: While we've heard comments here, we have taken part in a myriad of different public participation engagements

34
00:03:54,138 --> 00:04:07,755
SPEAKER_16: and want to ensure that we are being good fiscal stewards, but also ensuring that we are providing the independence and ability for all aspects of our population to be able to travel and move about to and fro.

35
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:11,099
SPEAKER_16: So with that being said, I will yield the floor to Ms.

36
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:13,842
SPEAKER_16: Filaios to commence with the presentation.

37
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:17,526
SPEAKER_16: If we could have board office staff pull that up, that would be appreciated.

38
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:18,087
SPEAKER_16: Thank you.

39
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,712
SPEAKER_20: been a while since I've used these microphones.

40
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,155
SPEAKER_20: Good evening, everyone.

41
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:48,126
SPEAKER_20: As GMCEO Johnson said, I'm Erin Vallejoz, the acting deputy assistant general manager for bus operations.

42
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:52,171
SPEAKER_20: And we are just going to go over just kind of a quick overview.

43
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:56,798
SPEAKER_20: I think it's a lot of information that you've already seen, so we won't spend too much time on that.

44
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:00,443
SPEAKER_20: Just kind of hit on what the initial recommendation was that we made.

45
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:08,458
SPEAKER_20: talk about some revised recommendations and then again kind of open it up for discussion to kind of get an idea of some direction.

46
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:08,912
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

47
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:12,037
SPEAKER_10: Faleos before, could you speak a little closer to the microphone?

48
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:12,799
SPEAKER_20: Yes, I can.

49
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:13,400
SPEAKER_10: Thank you so much.

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,281
SPEAKER_20: Of course.

51
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:26,481
SPEAKER_20: Okay, so just to kind of highlight on this again as GM CEO Johnson said, Accessor Ride and Access on Demand are the two programs that we have.

52
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:33,332
SPEAKER_20: Accessor Ride is RTD's federally required ADA complimentary paratransit service.

53
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:36,420
SPEAKER_20: It does supplement our fixed route services.

54
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:49,212
SPEAKER_20: There is a fair payment required for these services and customers must meet the criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to be eligible.

55
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:55,840
SPEAKER_20: This is provided with all RTD branded access ride vehicles that are all 100 percent accessible.

56
00:05:56,781 --> 00:06:01,547
SPEAKER_20: Then access on demand is our supplemental premium paratransit service.

57
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:06,093
SPEAKER_20: It is a curb-to-curb taxi and ride share service.

58
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:18,608
SPEAKER_20: It is available to current paratransit customers, so they must meet those eligibility criteria to qualify for access ride to then use access on demand.

59
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:24,947
SPEAKER_20: And as it stands today, RTD pays the first $25 of the trip and the remaining portion is paid by the customer.

60
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,661
SPEAKER_20: And again, ability today to take 60 total trips.

61
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,826
SPEAKER_20: So just some quick operating statistics.

62
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:40,839
SPEAKER_20: The annual operating cost in 2024 for excessive ride was just over 53 million and the customer trips were just over 500,000.

63
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:50,434
SPEAKER_20: And again, these are RTD owned vehicles and the contractors that operate this service have over 500 drivers mechanics and other staff.

64
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:55,968
SPEAKER_20: And then access on demand slash year it was about just over 15 3 million for the budget.

65
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:03,327
SPEAKER_20: Just over 685,000 trips and these are all provided by third party vehicles.

66
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,508
SPEAKER_20: So again, as we touched on, you must be eligible for access ride to also use access on demand.

67
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:22,222
SPEAKER_20: There is a process that customers must go through that determines if a customer has a disabling condition that would prevent them from using a regular fixed route service.

68
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:30,192
SPEAKER_20: There's an application process, a medical verification process, and then an in-person assessment that customers must complete.

69
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:34,719
SPEAKER_20: And there are a couple of different types of eligibility that a customer could receive.

70
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,448
SPEAKER_20: Unconditional means you can have access to the full service for up to four years.

71
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:46,797
SPEAKER_20: Temporary, you might have a condition that's going to improve recovering from surgery or something along those lines.

72
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:53,708
SPEAKER_20: And then conditional would be when there was something maybe you're sensitive to extreme hot or extreme cold.

73
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,934
SPEAKER_20: So you would be able to use it at those times, but not the full year.

74
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:05,693
SPEAKER_20: Okay, and as we have touched on, this is something that you've probably seen as well.

75
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:10,638
SPEAKER_20: We are continuing to see an increase in access on demand usage.

76
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:18,246
SPEAKER_20: This is through 2024, but we continue to see that access on demand trend line going up into the start of this year.

77
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:27,837
SPEAKER_20: And access ride, when you look at the trend line, while it is staying a little bit more stable, we are still seeing an increase in usage there as well.

78
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:38,685
SPEAKER_20: And as we've talked about, average monthly trips per customer, the majority of customers are falling into the category of taking up to 50 trips.

79
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:43,333
SPEAKER_20: That is about 90% of the customers when we lasted the analysis.

80
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:49,183
SPEAKER_20: And about 10% of the customers, again, fall into that 51 to 60 category.

81
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:56,401
SPEAKER_20: So now I'm going to just remind everyone of what our initial recommendations were back in 2024.

82
00:08:56,562 --> 00:09:02,409
SPEAKER_20: As it stands today again quickly, there's a zero dollar base customer fare.

83
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,511
SPEAKER_20: The trip cap is 60 per month.

84
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:07,215
SPEAKER_20: Subsidy is up to $25 per trip.

85
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:13,382
SPEAKER_20: It is available within the entire district and it is available 24 seven.

86
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:28,024
SPEAKER_20: Back when we came to you in November of 2024, we had proposed making changes, and this involved having a $4.50 based customer fare, which would be $2.25 for our live eligible customers.

87
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:31,149
SPEAKER_20: We proposed a trip cap of 40 per month.

88
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:40,703
SPEAKER_20: The subsidy would go to $20 per trip, and then it was proposed to mirror both the current service area and the service hours.

89
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:50,960
SPEAKER_20: With this recommendation, there were going to be cost savings that the district would realize, and that was going to be about 5.8 million dollars.

90
00:09:52,323 --> 00:10:00,362
SPEAKER_20: So instead of the projected yearly spend being a little bit over 15 million, we would go down to about 9.4.

91
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:11,537
SPEAKER_20: Okay, and as a result of some of the feedback and comments that we've heard, we did put together two additional revised scenarios.

92
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:15,103
SPEAKER_20: So scenario one is what I'm going to touch on first.

93
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,650
SPEAKER_20: So this has to do with an increased trip cap approach.

94
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:27,746
SPEAKER_20: So what we were proposing in this scenario is increasing the trip cap to 50 per month from the original 40 that was proposed.

95
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:35,682
SPEAKER_20: We are proposing as this is again as we've said a premium supplemental service a fair of $6.50 per trip.

96
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:40,271
SPEAKER_20: which would be $3.25 for our live customers.

97
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,718
SPEAKER_20: Then the remainder of the proposal does remain the same.

98
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:55,662
SPEAKER_20: We were still proposing a subsidy per trip of $20, and we are proposing mirroring the current service area and service hours as that of our accessoride program.

99
00:10:56,468 --> 00:11:11,347
SPEAKER_20: With this program, we did see actually a little bit of the yearly impact would be a cost savings of about $6.1 million, bringing our total spend to about a little over $9.1.

100
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:22,662
SPEAKER_20: With the 50 trips, that does allow for customers to still have, given there's about 20 weekdays in a month,

101
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:29,698
SPEAKER_20: That does allow for customers to still travel to work, but then does allow for some ancillary trips throughout the month.

102
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:38,693
SPEAKER_20: And then another scenario that we had put together is the tiered approach that we have discussed.

103
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:46,863
SPEAKER_20: With this approach, we would still maintain a trip cap of up to 60 trips per month, which matches what we have currently.

104
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:53,070
SPEAKER_20: There would be a $4.50 based customer fare for up to 30 trips.

105
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,309
SPEAKER_20: $5.50 for 31 to 50 and $6.50 for 51 to 60.

106
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,381
SPEAKER_20: And the remainder of the recommendation would remain the same.

107
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:23,804
SPEAKER_20: With this program, as some people have noted, due to kind of the program structure and some of the manual aspects that exist with monitoring today, there would be an increase in staff oversight that would result in additional staff headcount.

108
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:29,470
SPEAKER_20: Again, that had been noted, but as it stands today, the program does require quite a bit of manual intervention.

109
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:38,554
SPEAKER_20: There is also, as someone mentioned, the customers would need to be keeping a little bit closer track of their trips, and that could lead to confusion.

110
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:45,490
SPEAKER_20: It is something a customer would have to be regularly thinking, where am I at for the month?

111
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,078
SPEAKER_20: Have I hit that 30 trips so they know what to expect for their costs?

112
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:55,828
SPEAKER_20: With this program, we would see some reductions of just over $5 million.

113
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,297
SPEAKER_20: So it is a little bit less than some of the other recommendations that we've put forth.

114
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:06,669
SPEAKER_20: And it would bring our projected yearly spend to about $10.28 million a year.

115
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:11,218
SPEAKER_20: And actually,

116
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:22,662
SPEAKER_20: So proposed next steps we are here as GM CEO Johnson has said to just kind of garner everyone's feedback and get some guidance on a path forward.

117
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:30,034
SPEAKER_20: The intent is to do outreach and engagement in June based on some of that guidance and engage with the community.

118
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:40,690
SPEAKER_20: We would be coming back for board consideration in July with an actual recommended action to the committee and then provided the committee advanced it at the board meeting.

119
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,319
SPEAKER_20: And we would begin implementation in August with full implementation in October.

120
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:50,144
SPEAKER_20: And with that, I will open it up.

121
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:51,667
SPEAKER_10: Perfect.

122
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,890
SPEAKER_10: Thank you very much for your presentation, Ms.

123
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,391
SPEAKER_10: Vallejoz.

124
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,455
SPEAKER_10: OK, I'm going to open it up for directors.

125
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,637
SPEAKER_10: Second Vice Chair Whitmore.

126
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:04,551
Whitmore: Thank you for the presentation and the ease of absorbing the proposed changes.

127
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:17,930
Whitmore: Erin, looking at the second proposal, the tiered approach, one of our commenters talked about the complications of keeping up with number of trips.

128
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:24,118
Whitmore: Is that something that the new staff would be able to be

129
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:49,870
Whitmore: Clearinghouse if you will tour you have one call to RTD instead of calling a taxi and a lift and an Uber That seems to be the most difficult part of that I'm just curious if you think our staff would be handling that in a way that would be handy for our customers It's definitely something I think we could assist with but I do think there would still be some burden on the customer for having some of that responsibility and

130
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:55,925
SPEAKER_20: Again, as I mentioned, as it stands today, there is just a very manual aspect of the program.

131
00:14:56,466 --> 00:15:04,859
SPEAKER_20: And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.

132
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:07,723
SPEAKER_09: Thank you.

133
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:09,986
Catlin: Thank you.

134
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:16,273
Catlin: And thank you for a very clear presentation, although I have one question of clarification.

135
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,376
Catlin: You talk about mirroring the existing service area.

136
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:35,652
Catlin: One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that, um, I don't think that the customers were restricted to the three quarter mile within a fixed route.

137
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:38,353
Catlin: Would that change with this?

138
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:43,198
Catlin: Any of these proposals or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?

139
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:53,249
SPEAKER_20: As the pro the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the three quarter of a mile boundary that exists today for our accessory customers.

140
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:57,373
Catlin: Okay, that.

141
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:03,299
Catlin: That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.

142
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:03,900
Catlin: Thank you.

143
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:07,204

SPEAKER_10: Secretary Nicholson.

144
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:10,669
Nicholson: Thank you very much.

145
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:18,081
Nicholson: I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.

146
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:25,613
Nicholson: We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.

147
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:29,719
Nicholson: There are commuter routes and I

148
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:38,215
Nicholson: would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.

149
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:44,687
Nicholson: So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.

150
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,290
Nicholson: Otherwise, Peggy has like

151
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:50,689
Nicholson: two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.

152
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,836
Nicholson: There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.

153
00:16:54,818 --> 00:17:02,052
Nicholson: I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of

154
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:11,729
Nicholson: you know, not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.

155
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:22,487
Nicholson: The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, you know, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.

156
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:31,493
Nicholson: You know, I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in Peggy's district or yours exactly.

157
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:33,017
Nicholson: And so.

158
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:38,545
Nicholson: But creating a system where the trip cap is 40 bucks doesn't work for me.

159
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:44,074
Nicholson: Creating a trip cap where it's 15 bucks doesn't work for the people in her district.

160
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:55,811
Nicholson: It strikes me that the right approach would be to have different levels of financial cap and different levels of trip cap to go along with them and let people pick.

161
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:57,874
Nicholson: You want 60 trips at

162
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,212
Nicholson: $15 per.

163
00:17:59,673 --> 00:17:59,914
Nicholson: Great.

164
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:02,539
Nicholson: You want 50 trips at $20 per.

165
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:02,900
Nicholson: Great.

166
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,906
Nicholson: You want 40 trips at $30 per.

167
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:06,507
Nicholson: Great.

168
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,669
Nicholson: Depends on where you live.

169
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,633
Nicholson: Depends on the types of trips you're going to be taking.

170
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:19,693
Nicholson: But making people all fit into one size is either going to leave her people paying $20 for every single trip that they take.

171
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:28,772
Nicholson: or it's going to put people in my district in a reduced number of rides because very few trips are going to cost $20 or $25.

172
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:31,076
Nicholson: So those are my two pieces of feedback.

173
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:31,397
Nicholson: Thank you.

174
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:34,363
SPEAKER_09: Thank you, Secretary.

175
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:35,826
SPEAKER_09: Director Ruscha.

176
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,161
Paglieri: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
=END-1=

177
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:46,726
Paglieri: So I just wanted to offer a bit of context.

178
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:51,792
Paglieri: And the general manager, please interrupt me if I'm framing this wrong.

179
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:58,459
Paglieri: But the conversation that we're having tonight is a framework of a potential path forward.

180
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:05,526
Paglieri: And because of our OSS meeting went so long,

181
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:12,034
Paglieri: we weren't able to get to through the discussion and that also I think impacted our ability to have some interim discussions.

182
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:35,344
Paglieri: So I just want folks to you know keep keep an open mind to what staff is saying and definitely share that feedback because we're on a timeline but also just recognize that well and please if I'm saying the strong introduction but what is being presented is a concept framework and so we want so we'll get more feedback and then of course staff is going to be working very closely

183
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:43,093
Paglieri: with our existing customers and advocacy organizations to make further refinements and give us some more stuff to look at.

184
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:50,285
Paglieri: So I hope I didn't speak out of turn, but I just wanted to offer that for context.

185
00:19:51,026 --> 00:20:03,525
Paglieri: And I'm also listening and taking notes and I know staff is, so I would just urge if anyone has thoughts one way or another, please share them tonight since we are also on

186
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:07,758
Paglieri: timeline with our existing partners and those contracts as well.

187
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:08,159
Paglieri: Thank you.

188
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:09,923
Guissinger: Thank you, Director.

189
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:11,406
Guissinger: Director Larson.

190
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:15,495
Larsen: Thank you.

191
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:17,940
Larsen: I just have a question for Ms.

192
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,441
Larsen: Vallejos.

193
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:23,252
Larsen: So I saw I seen one of those slot these slides that it says there's

194
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:32,065
Larsen: In December of 2024, there were about 2,900 total active customers of access on demand.

195
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:38,292
Larsen: So there were 2,900 people, roughly, who used it in all of December.

196
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:39,574
Larsen: Is that right?

197
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:43,518
SPEAKER_20: I know that would be for the year, I believe.

198
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,280
Larsen: Let me just.

199
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,941
Larsen: OK.

200
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:50,946
Larsen: So 2,900 people used this service for the whole year.

201
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:51,687
Larsen: That's it.

202
00:20:52,578 --> 00:21:05,271
Larsen: And so I guess what I'm trying to just understand is, if we were going to spend, say, $10 million or $15 million on 2,900 people,

203
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,807
Larsen: What do we think the equivalent is for just our regular riders?

204
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:12,048
Larsen: Do we have any guess?

205
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:15,032
Larsen: I mean, I know people have different ridership.

206
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:29,430
Larsen: If we have a million customers a year and it's the majority of our budget, I'm just trying to get a sense of how the per-person spend for a regular rider compares to the per-person spend for access on demand.

207
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:33,756
SPEAKER_20: Go ahead, Deborah.

208
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:39,048
SPEAKER_16: So if I can, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Director Larsen, for the question.

209
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:41,753
SPEAKER_16: I would not want us to conjecture and speculate.

210
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:43,617
SPEAKER_16: We could double back and give you those numbers.

211
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:50,249
SPEAKER_16: As we talk about, you use the term regular writer, you're talking about those that are using fixed route service.

212
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,415
SPEAKER_16: I just want to be clear and intentional with the language we're using going forward.

213
00:21:53,395 --> 00:22:02,188
SPEAKER_16: So we need to assess that because it's a different level of service because with fixed route bus, we're not providing curb to curb service.

214
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:06,454
SPEAKER_16: And so we can double back and share that information with the board.

215
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:11,521
SPEAKER_16: But I think it wouldn't be fruitful for us to guesstimate because this is critically important.

216
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:17,390
SPEAKER_16: But as we come back and we have some guidance, we could provide that detailed information, if you will.

217
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,131
SPEAKER_16: Thank you.

218
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:21,175
SPEAKER_16: Thank you.

219
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:24,588
SPEAKER_10: Any other directors comments?

220
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:25,409
SPEAKER_09: Yeah, director Guzman.

221
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:33,882
Guzman: So I am concerned with the aligning with the ADA for the service area.

222
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:40,311
Guzman: District C is fairly blessed with

223
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:49,686
Guzman: multiple forms of transit and fixed route, where this is not a particular problem, but it is an issue in the suburban areas of the region.

224
00:22:50,127 --> 00:23:03,767
Guzman: And it is highly concerning that we would restrict it so much where people would be left off of the system that live within a quarter mile of a commuter bus and still not be able to access this.

225
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:18,596
Guzman: I also think that as we proceed into the future after the demographers presentation to the finance and planning committee, a big concern will be our aging population in the region.

226
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:24,624
Guzman: And it's a, you know, somebody said that this is a drop in the bucket for our budget.

227
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:36,117
Guzman: Maybe right now, but eventually this is going to catch up with us, which is why we're having this conversation and access on demand and folks that are able to

228
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:50,934
Guzman: or out of need, utilize this system, need to be considered as humans first and how we serve them, which is our mission, right?

229
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:52,637
Guzman: They need connection as well.

230
00:23:53,107 --> 00:24:06,549
Guzman: and not every one of them will be able to jump from a, jump, roll, walk, shuffle to a fixed route form of transportation to get them to their destinations.

231
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:14,081
Guzman: I have a question about the time on this, right?

232
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:19,350
Guzman: If it's mirroring regular service provision for the whole region,

233
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:28,370
Guzman: It kind of makes sense, but I would still be concerned for the reasons that emergencies don't happen on RTD schedule.

234
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:38,384
Guzman: And so somebody who already has a specific need for this type of transportation usage might need to go to the doctor.

235
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,608
Guzman: And what do they do if they're unable to drive?

236
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:52,688
Guzman: And regular bus service is not something that they can use because the buses aren't running a two o'clock in the morning emergency room visit is not unheard of and not uncommon in anybody's life.

237
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:56,014
Guzman: And yet what do we do to take care of those that are most vulnerable.

238
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:00,643
Guzman: So for me, I would really want to see some clarity around

239
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:02,050
Guzman: those two areas.

240
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:08,700
Guzman: I am frankly less concerned about minimal difference of cost savings.

241
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:12,145
Guzman: I mean, we're talking $5 million.

242
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:18,295
Guzman: That's not really the top priority for me on that part.

243
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:43,557
Guzman: right now it will eventually get there because this will likely continue to grow but I do want to make sure that we are basing ourselves in reality to serve the taxpayers needs and this is a need right this is not a desire as some of the other services we want to grow and create are this one is an actual need and so I want to be clear in my language on that and why I'm

244
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,914
Guzman: depositing these comments within that framework.

245
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,479
Guzman: So that would be my feedback.

246
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:52,994
Guzman: I'd like to see something a little bit different on those two things, the service area and the time for service.

247
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:53,476
Guzman: Thank you.

248
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:54,760
Guzman: Thank you, Director.

249
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:56,145
Guzman: Director Harwick.

250
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,422
Harwick: Well, thank you, Director Guzman.

251
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:01,746
Harwick: I'm just going to pretty much replicate everything you just said.

252
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:11,162
Harwick: I represent Arvada, and Arvada is actually the fastest growing aging population.

253
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,564
Harwick: However, I said that.

254
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:13,506
Harwick: I'm not sure I said it right.

255
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:19,637
Harwick: And a lot of our service is not in the areas where we have those aging people.

256
00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:22,842
Harwick: So I'd really like to see

257
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,438
Harwick: just the boundary kept the same.

258
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,484
Harwick: I'm also really again with director Guzman keeping it as a full 24 seven.

259
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:46,905
Harwick: I just like I have a friend in a wheelchair and I just think about her trying like if she didn't live where she lived if she lived where I live she would have such a difficult time getting you know around her community and I won't just

260
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:52,899
Harwick: especially like if the service is outside of that time period, it's just precluding her life.

261
00:26:52,959 --> 00:27:04,101
Harwick: And I know we don't all have these, the same abilities when we're riding the bus, but for a person with disability that's blind or in a wheelchair, I think that we can sort of extend them the grace that they deserve.

262
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:07,453
Harwick: I also would like to see the cap stay at 60.

263
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:20,816
Harwick: I think that, again, I know that it's a, you know, less than 10% of the population go above the 50 rides, but I think it's still like that's, we're giving them access to a free and full life.

264
00:27:21,878 --> 00:27:30,072
Harwick: And I think if we are gonna go with the 650, I think that that to me is fine, but I also think that it would be imperative that we really,

265
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:57,561
Harwick: put out the live program and let let those writers know That there is another option like there's always with someone the other day she Lives about three miles away from where she works and you know She can afford it, but just barely and she didn't know about the live program So I think that there's we're missing an opportunity there specifically with these With these writers so and then my last one is just a request is it possible to get a map of

266
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:12,317
Harwick: like sort of like a density map of where AOD is like highly being used to sort of go with that, like thinking about, you know, West Jefferson County versus central Denver, just kind of see what that looks like.

267
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:19,605
Harwick: Obviously we want to anonymize the data, but I think it's sort of just would be interesting for us to know where the sort of hotspots of usage are.

268
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:20,906
Harwick: Thank you.

269
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:21,667
SPEAKER_09: Thank you, Director Harwick.

270
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,028
SPEAKER_09: Ms.

271
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:22,468
Harwick: Johnson.

272
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:41,897
SPEAKER_16: Yes, Director Harwick, if I understood you correctly, because I'm taking copious notes here, you are in support for all intents and purposes of what I hear, the modification of scenario one, keeping it at 60 trips with 650 and then one information relative to what the current usage is from a geographic vantage point.

273
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:43,178
SPEAKER_16: Okay, thank you.

274
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,060
Harwick: Thank you.

275
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,144
Harwick: Yeah, but I also want to keep the service areas the same as they are today.

276
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:51,967
SPEAKER_10: Yeah.

277
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:52,287
SPEAKER_10: Excellent.

278
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,493
=START-2=
SPEAKER_10: Director Nicholson, then Director Ruscha.

279
00:28:57,036 --> 00:29:00,702
Nicholson: Yeah, just a quick follow-up onto that.

280
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:09,058
Nicholson: When it comes to go to Director Ruscha, my brain, I lost my train of thought for a second, so.

281
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:11,102
SPEAKER_10: Alright, Director Ruscha.

282
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:17,110
Paglieri: Thank you for the red rover.
=END-2=

283
00:29:17,171 --> 00:29:17,972
Paglieri: I wasn't prepared.

284
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:18,874
Paglieri: I went back to my notes.

285
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:19,796
Paglieri: Okay.

286
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:34,305
Paglieri: So, um, anyway, I, um, so I, some of this, um, feedback I did share with staff and I, um, I don't want to be repetitive, but I also just want to be really transparent with my, my colleagues, uh, because we haven't had this public conversation yet.

287
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:52,084
Paglieri: And just high level, some of the things that I had shared was, you know, first of all, we don't want to put one proposal out before the community and get feedback like the one that we've had out for several months and then come back with something else that looks like less than what we originally proposed.

288
00:29:52,185 --> 00:29:55,129
Paglieri: And so one of the pain points that I had was just the idea of

289
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,337
Paglieri: going up to 650 for the initial fare because that's not what we originally put out there.

290
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:10,558
Paglieri: So one of the things that I urge is that if we put an offer on the table, so to speak, we don't take it back.

291
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,601
Paglieri: That's kind of our baseline now.

292
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:18,552
Paglieri: And another piece of feedback I had is that where something is not

293
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:32,897
Paglieri: For every change we make, which essentially results in a reduction of a service of some kind or an increase in price, we really have to justify that line by line.

294
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:41,731
Paglieri: So for example, if we decide that we are going to strictly align with service hours, then we have to justify it.

295
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:43,233
Paglieri: It doesn't cost us any more money.

296
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:44,415
Paglieri: It's not going to save us a penny.

297
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:48,201
Paglieri: If somebody, you know, uses on demand,

298
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:53,458
Paglieri: 15 or 20 minutes or an hour before fixed drought starts.

299
00:30:55,102 --> 00:31:00,013
Paglieri: Likewise, it's not costing us that I could see a lot of money, if any.

300
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:04,880
Paglieri: for us to offer service outside of our general service area.

301
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,864
Paglieri: I know that was flagged in the peer review.

302
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:28,164
Paglieri: So I, because this idea has been on the table for so many months, I also want to caution us about the service area idea because if we restrict the service, that means there are people who currently are using AOD and they're going to lose it.

303
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:29,325
Paglieri: So

304
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:40,961
Paglieri: I, um, so that was just, I mean, that was just the, the kind of like high level, like, um, theme that I had in, in the feedback.

305
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:54,840
Paglieri: Um, and also, you know, I'm going back to the, uh, initial like a fair, um, we also want to be really careful about what we think.

306
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:58,378
Paglieri: is inexpensive because it's really relative.

307
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:17,892
Paglieri: So for some folks using the service and they have like a fixed income or very limited income, if we even do you know 450 which would be parity with excess ride and I think I could accept that but like say we go up to 650 or we do this tiered system

308
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:26,853
Paglieri: then for some folks, they are not going to be able to write or they're going to be choosing, do I get to the doctor or do I buy food for tonight?

309
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:30,717
Paglieri: So I just wanted to put that out there.

310
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:40,907
Paglieri: And finally, well, actually, I'll stop there.

311
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:48,334
Paglieri: I concurred with what a lot of other directors said in terms of keeping the program as is as much as we can.

312
00:32:49,023 --> 00:33:01,228
Paglieri: I think that, but I also just want to commend staff, you know, because we are at a much different place than where we were several months ago.

313
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:03,673
Paglieri: This is a totally different conversation.

314
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:05,957
Paglieri: really slashing this program.

315
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:12,203
Paglieri: And staff did a lot of work and we spent several months, we almost voted on this a few months ago.

316
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:21,110
Paglieri: And they listened to us as directors and they listened to community because as you know, we've had hundreds of public comments over several months on this.

317
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:29,618
Paglieri: And they said, okay, we can take a timeout, we can reassess, we can get some different data, we can, you know, kind of present a new paradigm.

318
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:33,441
Paglieri: So again, what's before us today is a sketch of ideas, the feedback is good.

319
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:38,728
Paglieri: But I really do want to commend staff for listening and working with us in partnership.

320
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:39,671
Paglieri: So thank you.

321
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:41,076
Paglieri: And thank you.

322
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,143
Guissinger: Thank you, Director Ruscha.

323
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:44,046
=START-3=
Guissinger: Director Nicholson.

324
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:46,755
Nicholson: Thank you.

325
00:33:48,119 --> 00:34:02,977
Nicholson: Is there any step during enrollment of AAR and AOD where we ask people if they are enrolled in the live program and ask them, hey, we're taking 14 other pieces of documentation from you.

326
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:06,982
Nicholson: I mean, AAR is remarkably complicated to sign up for.

327
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:13,911
Nicholson: Is there any part of that process where we try to enroll them in the live program as well?

328
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,072
Nicholson: And then I have a quick follow up.

329
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:22,427
SPEAKER_20: I will have to find out about that as part of the process.

330
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:27,734
SPEAKER_20: Um, and we will confirm if that is, you know, how that is handled as, as part of the process.

331
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:29,075
Nicholson: Yeah.

332
00:34:29,155 --> 00:34:39,448
Nicholson: So, yeah, as a, as a first thing I would say that since we're going to be updating this to offer the, the live discount and, and not make it free, uh, it should be required as part of the process.

333
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:47,978
Nicholson: If you're going through to sign up for AOD or AAR, some point in that process to set, to ask someone to affirm that they are either already signed up or,

334
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:52,593
Nicholson: haven't signed up or whatever, and then give them the opportunity to make it super easy.

335
00:34:52,653 --> 00:34:59,220
Nicholson: Because we only have 15,000 people signed up for live right now, and we have 180 something thousand boardings every day.

336
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:05,888
Nicholson: And I think only about half the people in AOD are currently signed up for, or AAR currently signed up for live.

337
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:08,291
Nicholson: So definitely something I'd like to see there.

338
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:17,661
Nicholson: The second thing, I want to echo what Director Ruscha said about the effect on people who

339
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:34,300
Nicholson: are low income to having these fares, but I want to take it from the other side, which is if you don't have a lot of money and you need to get around to a lot of places, then 40 trips maybe, or whatever the number ends up being, not nearly enough in a way that someone who makes more money

340
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,643
Nicholson: can probably have some discretionary to be like, oh, I've run out of trips.

341
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:40,966
Nicholson: I can afford to take an extra three or five or whatever.

342
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:45,110
Nicholson: So I'm not sure that that needs to be fit into the policy here.

343
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,712
Nicholson: I'm wary about trying to do too much too quickly.

344
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:58,522
Nicholson: But I do think we need to get a report from you after, I don't know, six months a year that looks at how many trips are people on live using?

345
00:35:58,763 --> 00:35:59,744
Nicholson: Are they maxing out?

346
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,346
Nicholson: Or are we seeing sort of the same curve?

347
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:15,021
Nicholson: from live users as we do from regular users right now, and that might inform us to take action a year from now to try to offer the right service for people who need it.

348
00:36:15,062 --> 00:36:17,104
Nicholson: Some live people make decent incomes.

349
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:24,653
Nicholson: Some of them are literally broke, and we need to recognize that those two groups of people have very different lived experiences.

350
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:26,215
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Secretary.

351
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:26,475
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

352
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:26,856
SPEAKER_10: Johnson?

353
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:30,240
SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you very much, Director Nicholson.
=END-3=

354
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:33,095
SPEAKER_16: Mr. Chair, thank you, Director Nicholson, for the comments.

355
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:50,174
SPEAKER_16: And what I will say in reference to your request, it appeared to be a directive, but I would just offer this up to you that once we collectively agree upon the path forward in this Board acts, we can then assess what might be most prudent, because at this point in time, we don't know what we don't know.

356
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:55,980
SPEAKER_16: And relative to what you just asked, I can't commit to that without knowing what we intend to do.

357
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,882
SPEAKER_16: So I just had to say that for the record.

358
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:59,102
SPEAKER_16: because it seemed as if Ms.

359
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:02,767
SPEAKER_16: Baleos was giving direction, and I don't think that's appropriate at this juncture.

360
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:03,527
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

361
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:05,330
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

362
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:05,410
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

363
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,010
SPEAKER_10: Director Larson.

364
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:08,193
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

365
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:14,761
Larsen: I was just kind of doing some stuff on my calculator.

366
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:25,253
Larsen: And so if we only have 3,000 people who use excess on demand, I mean, it seems like the disabled population

367
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,456
Larsen: You know, it might be 300,000 people in Denver or something, you know, much, much larger.

368
00:37:32,937 --> 00:37:39,504
Larsen: Do we, how do, how confident are we of our projection that it'll stay at around, I mean, or, or however much we think it'll increase?

369
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:51,055
Larsen: I mean, what do we think the total number of active users might become and why won't it become, you know, several, many multiples more than 3,000 or so?

370
00:37:56,671 --> 00:38:05,481
SPEAKER_16: First, if I may, just for everyone's identification, you probably have heard this over the course of several months in the public comment discussions.

371
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:21,379
SPEAKER_16: When we talk about access on demand, currently as it's configured, recognizing that we're using private entities, transportation network companies in particular, not all of the vehicles are outfitted to be wheelchair accessible.

372
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:29,435
SPEAKER_16: So that's a critical element when we're talking about the population because there's different disabilities that individuals have.

373
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:36,404
SPEAKER_16: Some may have cognitive, somebody may be using a mobility device, which can't be accommodated going forward.

374
00:38:36,424 --> 00:38:39,347
SPEAKER_16: So I just wanted to provide that context prior to Ms.

375
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:44,233
SPEAKER_16: Vallejo's answering the question because that has not been factored into this conversation this evening.

376
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:45,655
SPEAKER_16: And I believe it's a germane point.

377
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:48,278
SPEAKER_16: Thank you, Director.

378
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:53,165
SPEAKER_20: And I don't think I need to add anything that was really exactly what I was going to say.

379
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:58,851
SPEAKER_20: Not everyone is able to use the access on demand service that is eligible for excessive ride.

380
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,633
SPEAKER_20: Other is a difference there.

381
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:02,214
Larsen: Can I just follow up?

382
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:09,161
Larsen: But I mean, surely many more people than 3000 in the metro area would be eligible though.

383
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,447
SPEAKER_20: Well, and again, we have continued continue to see substantial growth.

384
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:20,290
SPEAKER_20: in the number of customers that are beginning to use the service.

385
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:27,620
SPEAKER_20: Again, the trips that we are seeing continue to grow even into this year, so we are seeing quite significant growth still.

386
00:39:30,763 --> 00:39:31,084
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

387
00:39:31,264 --> 00:39:31,584
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

388
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:32,686
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

389
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:35,389
SPEAKER_10: Any further questions, comments?

390
00:39:37,632 --> 00:39:37,812
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

391
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:38,613
SPEAKER_10: Johnson and Ms.

392
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:40,636
SPEAKER_10: Vallejoz, thank you very much for the presentation.

393
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:42,959
SPEAKER_10: I hope this was helpful feedback for going forward.

394
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:44,100
SPEAKER_10: So thank you.

395
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:45,824
SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.

396
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:48,708
SPEAKER_16: This was in the sense that we do have some guidance now.

397
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:51,733
SPEAKER_16: We know what we need to do as we do further outreach.

398
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:54,156
SPEAKER_16: So thank you all very much for the opportunity.

399
00:39:54,677 --> 00:40:04,352
SPEAKER_16: And when we come back in July with a recommended action, hopefully we can all rally around that, recognizing the public comments that we heard in the direction in which you provide it.

400
00:40:04,372 --> 00:40:04,732
SPEAKER_16: Thank you.

401
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:05,313
Guzman: Thank you.

402
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:06,395
Guzman: Director Guzman.

403
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:10,181
Guzman: Will that recommended action be going through operation safety and security?

404
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:12,063
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

405
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:12,484
SPEAKER_10: Johnson.

406
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,751
SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

407
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:17,318
SPEAKER_16: And thank you, Director Guzman.

408
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,706
SPEAKER_16: I apologize for the question.

409
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:22,614
SPEAKER_16: Most definitely we will go through the committee procedure.

410
00:40:22,634 --> 00:40:25,282
SPEAKER_16: The only reason why this didn't happen because it's time sensitive.

411
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:26,305
SPEAKER_16: So thank you.

412
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:27,678
SPEAKER_10: Thank you very much.

413
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:29,220
SPEAKER_10: All right.

414
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,381
SPEAKER_10: Well, thank you again, Ms.

415
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:30,862
SPEAKER_10: Filaios.

416
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:32,104

421
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:49,486
SPEAKER_10: If committee reports could be less than a minute, that'd be greatly appreciated.

422
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:52,270
SPEAKER_10: Audit committee chair music.

423
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,271

00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:16,217
Guzman: The Finance and Planning Committee met Tuesday, May 13th, discussed a handful of items, received a report from our state demographer, which was really awesome.

433
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:23,545
Guzman: Directors are reminded to email the board office if you had any follow-up questions or things specific to your sub-district so we can send that all at once.

434
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,122
Guzman: to receive an answer to the whole board.

435
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:34,014
Guzman: Received an update from DOTI for the East Colfax BRT and three items came out of committee, which will be before us tonight.

00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:47,071
Guzman: Just want to thank the committee for all of the hard work and the next meeting for the finance and planning committee is scheduled for Tuesday, June 10th at 5.30 PM.

00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:49,316
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Director.

439
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:55,135
SPEAKER_10: Committee Chair Ruscio or Committee Chair Harwick, what would you like to share for OSS?

440
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,711
Paglieri: I'll take it, sir.

441
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:57,973
Paglieri: Thank you.

442
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:00,798
Paglieri: So we met remotely on Wednesday, May 14th.

443
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,204
Paglieri: We gaveled in at 5.34 p.m.

444
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:06,829
Paglieri: and wrapped up at 9.44 p.m.

445
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,714
Paglieri: We had extensive public comments.

446
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:12,219
Paglieri: The most I've ever seen at any OSS meeting.

447
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,781
Paglieri: That was great.

448
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,104
Paglieri: Come visit us anytime.

449
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:20,413
Paglieri: It's always nice to know that people are listening to our podcast and by that I mean our YouTube channel.

450
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:43,279
Paglieri: But two major items that went on the consent calendar for tonight's meeting is the 2025-2028 Title VI program update, just ensuring that we stay in compliance with federal law, civil rights protections, and meet the needs of our customers, as well as the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension.

451
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:48,224
Paglieri: FNP authorized a budget transfer, which had no financial impact.

452
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:50,247
Paglieri: It was just moving from one department to another.

453
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:58,996
Paglieri: And then we filed that up with a vote to extend that contract for another year with the cost of up to just a little over 22 million.

454
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:03,240
Paglieri: And we did have four discussion items, two of which were heard.

455
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:08,406
Paglieri: So we had the Vision Zero update from GM CEO Johnson.

456
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:13,869
Paglieri: As you might recall, we passed a Vision Zero resolution last year, and so that planning process is underway.

457
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,932
Paglieri: We had a customer communications update.

458
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:28,167
Paglieri: Stuart Summers led an excellent presentation, discussing how we handle communications, some tech updates, customer service aspects.

459
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,492
Paglieri: real-time information and service alerts and things like that.

460
00:43:32,253 --> 00:43:39,585
Paglieri: Unfortunately, we did hit our four-hour mark before we could finish our agenda items, and even though the nuggets weren't playing, folks wanted to go, and we were tired.

461
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:51,403
Paglieri: So we moved the on-demand item to the nice meeting, which we just heard, and then we'll be hearing Paratransit Legacy Customer Protection's proposal next month.

462
00:43:51,383 --> 00:44:03,481
Paglieri: So for those of you who have been tracking what we're doing with paratransit, I strongly encourage you to come visit us at OSSX month and weigh in so we get your feedback before we come back with something more final.

463
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:13,016
Paglieri: Our next meeting is Wednesday, June 11th at 5.30, same time, same place, online or on the phone.

464
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:14,097
Paglieri: Thank you.

465
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:15,940
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, committee chair.

466
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,039
SPEAKER_10: Uh, now to for performance committee chair Guzman.

467
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,060
SPEAKER_10: I get it.

468
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,623
Guzman: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

469
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:23,886
Guzman: Performance committee met Monday, May 12th, 2025.

470
00:44:23,926 --> 00:44:39,649
Guzman: Uh, I, I, the, the committee chair presented a draft proposal that I had worked on previously with vice chair Gucci and Ritter for the 2025 general manager, CEO performance assessment form and process that needed to be updated to seek input from the committee and other directors.

471
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:52,120
Guzman: to find a way forward for the rest of the year based on the current 2025 general manager CO short term goals and the respective adjustments made to the scoring points based on our votes in January.

472
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,002
Guzman: I've received some feedback.

473
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:57,449
Guzman: I continue to invite directors to submit the feedback.

474
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,432
Guzman: If you have not reviewed that meeting, please do so.

475
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:02,718
Guzman: And any questions you may have, please email me or call me.

476
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:05,283
Guzman: I am happy to engage in that conversation.

477
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:14,479
Guzman: Of course, we are doing that with participation and a lot of communication with the general manager CEO, Deborah Johnson.

478
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:20,033
Guzman: The next meeting of the performance committee is scheduled for June 2, 2025 at 8.30 a.m.

479
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:25,799
Guzman: I really want to encourage all of you, directors, to please participate in that meeting.

480
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,041
Guzman: Two reasons.

481
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:28,362
Guzman: One, we are going to receive.

482
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:35,990
Guzman: I hope I don't get this wrong because I don't have my work plan in front of me, but the employee survey results in the beginning of that meeting.

483
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:38,273
Guzman: And then we will adjourn into executive session.

484
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:43,333
Guzman: for the second quarterly one-on-one opportunity with our general manager CEO.

485
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:57,713
Guzman: And that is part of our contracted agreement with the general manager CEO to receive information from her and provide feedback regarding personnel matters.

486
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:06,416
Guzman: Additionally, the performance committee is set to have a second meeting in June because of that quarterly check-in.

487
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:12,243
Guzman: The second meeting is planned, I believe, for June 23rd at 8.30 a.m.

488
00:46:12,263 --> 00:46:21,754
Guzman: And that is in order to do a deep dive into our community and customer surveys, which align with our community value and customer excellent strategic initiatives.

489
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:26,400
Guzman: And I would again encourage all directors to participate in that meeting as well.

490
00:46:26,752 --> 00:46:33,682
Guzman: which is the overview of the current status of the agency's surveys and where we're at with regard to public.

491
00:46:34,102 --> 00:46:41,893
Guzman: It will inform the process for setting goals and priorities for the 2026 year, which we are also doing all at the same time.

492
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:55,813
Guzman: So prioritizing what is important for our customers, the survey reports are a great opportunity to engage with direct feedback from our constituents in all areas of the agency.

493
00:46:56,266 --> 00:47:02,801
Guzman: I do believe a little birdie has told me on one of the buses that these should be really positive discussions.

494
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:13,023
Guzman: So if you need more than that invitation, please signal tonight and I will call you and email you and hound you to be on these meetings because I think they're really important for all of us.

495
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:13,785
Guzman: Thank you.

496
00:47:14,288 --> 00:47:15,591
SPEAKER_10: Thank you committee chair goes on.

497
00:47:16,432 --> 00:47:17,234
SPEAKER_10: All right, moving on.

00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:25,430
SPEAKER_10: We're going to do the approval of board meeting minutes and committee reports, the board and committee meeting minutes were included in the board packet.

499
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:30,299
SPEAKER_10: Are there any corrections from the board for the minutes to be approved this evening.

500
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:34,187
SPEAKER_10: Any corrections.

501
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:35,909
SPEAKER_10: All right.

502
00:47:36,249 --> 00:47:42,739
SPEAKER_10: Unless there's objection to considering the minutes all the same time, my please have a motion to approve the minutes for the following meetings.

00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:08,314
SPEAKER_10: I'm going to give it to Guzman.

510
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:15,521
SPEAKER_10: So I heard Director Guzman as the mover and Director Guzman as the second.

511
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:17,102
SPEAKER_10: Is there any discussion on this motion?

512
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:22,388
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

513
00:48:22,408 --> 00:48:24,029
SPEAKER_10: Seeing none, I'll now call the vote.

515
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,850
SPEAKER_10: It'll pass 14, zero, and one absent.

516
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:34,955
SPEAKER_10: Excellent.

517
00:48:35,657 --> 00:48:35,978
SPEAKER_10: All right.

518
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:40,549
SPEAKER_10: Moving on, it will be our chairs report.

519
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:46,463
SPEAKER_10: Due to the late hour, I will be quoting my principal and saying, I am giving you all the gift of time.

520
00:48:46,713 --> 00:48:55,524
SPEAKER_10: And all I can say with my chair's report is we will have a border treat on June 7th talking about our 2026 priorities for the agency.

521
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,628
SPEAKER_10: Again, directors, hopefully you all can make that.

522
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:03,274
SPEAKER_10: It'll be a very healthy discussion, a very hearty discussion, I guarantee.

523
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:06,238
SPEAKER_10: But please make sure you have that marked down on your calendars.

524
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:07,219
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

525
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:13,209
Larsen: Did you want to remind everybody about the survey we sent you?

526
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:14,210
SPEAKER_10: Of course, thank you.

527
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:21,557
SPEAKER_10: And of course, directors, you'll see in my weekly update, there was a survey that might have been passed too.

528
00:49:22,037 --> 00:49:24,560
SPEAKER_10: And if you've not filled out that survey, please do so.

529
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,223
SPEAKER_10: Thank you for the directors who did fill it in.

530
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:30,265
SPEAKER_10: So that's okay.

531
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:36,451
SPEAKER_10: If we could get that in by Monday morning, that'd be excellent.

532
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:38,272
SPEAKER_10: I'll include that in my weekly update though.

533
00:49:38,473 --> 00:49:38,893
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

534
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:44,505
SPEAKER_10: I'll give it now over to you, GMCO Johnson.

535
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:58,385
SPEAKER_16: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and by to recognize the lateness of the hour, I just have a couple of elements that I'll share with you that are in alignment with our activities and strategic endeavors since our last board meeting on Tuesday, April 29th.

536
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:09,100
SPEAKER_16: One notable aspect is the legislative conference held by the American Public Transportation Association from May 18th through the 20th.

537
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:22,069
SPEAKER_16: In Washington DC, just for everyone's edification, this annual conference is an opportunity for public transportation industry professionals across the nation to visit Washington DC and connect with policymakers, implementers, and their staffs.

538
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:33,045
SPEAKER_16: The conference helps educate and inform active members on important federal legislation and policy initiatives and affords an unparalleled opportunity to shape the industry's positions in federal advocacy agenda.

539
00:50:33,515 --> 00:50:44,527
SPEAKER_16: I along with directors of Keith Chandler and Guchin Ritter and government relations officer Michael Davies attended conference sessions and meetings with members of Colorado's congressional delegation and their staffs.

540
00:50:44,547 --> 00:51:00,045
SPEAKER_16: While chairing an APTA committee meeting on Sunday, May 8th, I personally engaged with Tariq Bakari who is the acting administrator of the Federal Transit Administration who shared his views and inputs as it relates to public transit as well as the importance of federal and local partnerships.

541
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:07,786
SPEAKER_16: Just yesterday, Tuesday, May 27th, I along with members of my team met with individuals representing the Alliance to Transform Transportation.

542
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:13,933
SPEAKER_16: As you may be aware, it's a coalition of groups on transit related matters in Colorado.

543
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:29,830
SPEAKER_16: Alliance representatives in attendance included Executive Director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Danny Katz, or Co-Purg, as we refer to it, Jill Lockenture, Executive Director of the Denver Streets Partnership, Portia Prescott, President of the Rocky Mountain NAACP,

544
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:37,980
SPEAKER_16: uh, branch, uh, the state conference representing Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming, Dennis Hawkins representing the amalgamated transit union 10 01.

545
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:46,715
SPEAKER_16: Matt Fromer representing Transportation and Land Use, well, he is the Transportation and Land Use Policy Manager from the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project.

546
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:51,582
SPEAKER_16: The meeting really was focused on Alliance's vision for transit in the Denver region.

547
00:51:52,403 --> 00:52:00,255
SPEAKER_16: As you know, they have been very vocal in which they're seeking to increase funding for transit in the Denver region by $420 million per year.

548
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:06,311
SPEAKER_16: to bolster the frequency and availability of transit services in the metro area.

549
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:21,383
SPEAKER_16: From RTD's perspective, questions were posed relative to how that $420 million figure was derived and they explained how that came about with the work they had done with the third party entity.

550
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,569
SPEAKER_16: of very bare bones relative to providing some information.

551
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:42,983
SPEAKER_16: And then we talked about the agency's focus, which all of you are very well aware that we are laser focused on asset renewal, state of good repair, and rightsizing transit service and alignment with RTD's branded comprehensive operational analysis being the system optimization plan.

552
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:57,801
SPEAKER_16: Related to personal security, as was recently reported, RTD experienced a 60% reduction in security-related calls for service, as well as a three-year decrease in reports of criminal activities between 2022 and 2025 at Denver Union Station.

553
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:12,379
SPEAKER_16: The decrease is representative of concerted efforts to restore and maintain a welcoming transit environment within the critical multi-modal transit hub, and following a collaborative and multifaceted strategy aimed at enhancing

554
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:17,755
SPEAKER_16: personal safety and security through crime prevention through environmental design methodologies.

555
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:24,121
SPEAKER_16: This effort would have not have been a success without the commitment of numerous agency employees as well as support from the city and county of Denver.

556
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:34,311
SPEAKER_16: It's police department, the downtown Denver partnerships, Sage hospitality, the lower Denver neighborhood association, as well as several local businesses and downtown Denver residents.

557
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:41,117
SPEAKER_16: Fair enforcement has also increased in recent months, which is the result of RTDs growing ranks of sworn police officers

558
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:56,093
SPEAKER_16: haven't been trained to perform this function alongside the contracted team that we have in security with Allied Universal personnel who had primarily been responsible for this responsibility.

559
00:53:56,614 --> 00:54:04,624
SPEAKER_16: I look forward to sharing additional details regarding the impacts of these efforts during the June Performance Committee, which you heard Committee Chair Guzman reference.

560
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:11,398
SPEAKER_16: When I along with staff will present data related to annual customer community and employee surveys that have recently concluded.

561
00:54:11,439 --> 00:54:32,232
SPEAKER_16: On a related note, the agency has proactively increased its transit police officer presence at Denver Union Station and across the agency's downtown Denver sector to support the personal safety and security of customers and visitors attending major events and activity, notably as we know, while we're no longer in the hockey playoffs and NBA, but

562
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:36,885
SPEAKER_16: people had a welcoming experience in and around our facilities.

563
00:54:37,326 --> 00:54:48,898
SPEAKER_16: And RTD PD had increased patrols at Denver Union Station and bus stops and rail stations, the high of, before the high profile events, which included the playoff games I just referenced.

564
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:53,543
SPEAKER_16: And this coincides with increasing Denver police patrols throughout the downtown area.

565
00:54:54,184 --> 00:55:01,071
SPEAKER_16: And RTD and DPD are working closely to collaborate to support enhanced safety for the traveling public.

566
00:55:03,194 --> 00:55:15,850
SPEAKER_16: And moreover, data and metrics related to personal safety and security are now conveniently located on the recently created security related metrics page, and we've actually showcased that on other social media channels as well.

567
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:29,708
SPEAKER_16: As it relates to our customer excellence in relation to the strategic priorities of customer excellence and employee ownership, I shared yesterday with the board the last of the 31 light rail speed restrictions put into place last year on the DH

568
00:55:30,228 --> 00:55:32,932
SPEAKER_16: and E and R lines was lifted as of yesterday morning.

569
00:55:34,013 --> 00:55:38,539
SPEAKER_16: I want to give a special shout out to our maintenance of way teams that have done yeoman's work.

570
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:48,253
SPEAKER_16: The final speed restriction, which was approximately 400 feet in southbound segment north of south more station and was removed after crews completed those repairs.

571
00:55:50,977 --> 00:56:00,049
SPEAKER_16: Keeping in mind those rigorous restrictions were put into place due to the fact that we enhanced our inspections of track

572
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:05,917
SPEAKER_16: back in May 2024 as an enhanced focus on maintaining the agency's assets and a state of good repair.

573
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:10,181
SPEAKER_16: At the time, you know, crews found several minor issues and track imperfections.

574
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:22,994
SPEAKER_16: So as I said before, I thank and congratulate all the agency employees who worked tirelessly over the course of these 11 months.

575
00:56:23,294 --> 00:56:26,998
SPEAKER_16: And like I said, a special shout out to MOW.

576
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:43,228
SPEAKER_16: I would be remiss if I didn't state that while this is a cost to celebrate, I shared previously as we look at our infrastructure and it continues to age, this will be par for the course, but since we're ahead of where we were before, we will see less of an impact, I'm certain.

577
00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:51,822
SPEAKER_16: And last, but certainly not least, I'm pleased to welcome RTD's new Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who's in the audience, she's given a wave.

578
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:54,021
SPEAKER_16: who began her tenure on May 12th.

579
00:56:54,342 --> 00:56:59,348
SPEAKER_16: And this is her in her first in-person board meeting while we introduced her at the Finance and Planning Committee.

580
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,672
SPEAKER_16: You guys are real people, not figments of our imagination.

581
00:57:02,692 --> 00:57:04,415
SPEAKER_16: So I wanted to ensure I did that here.

582
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:09,942
SPEAKER_16: So with that, I will yield the floor so we can move on to the rest of the matters that we have before.

583
00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:11,564
SPEAKER_16: So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

584
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:16,089
SPEAKER_09: Thank you, GMCO Johnson.

585
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:19,834
SPEAKER_09: Any comments or questions for GMCO Johnson?

586
00:57:23,003 --> 00:57:23,404
SPEAKER_09: Yeah.

587
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,071
SPEAKER_10: Very exciting.

588
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:30,953
SPEAKER_10: And Kelly, welcome to the team.

589
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:31,834
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

590
00:57:34,658 --> 00:57:35,038
SPEAKER_10: All right.

591
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:36,280
SPEAKER_10: Moving on.

592
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,364
SPEAKER_10: Uh, they, we're going to move on to unanimous consent.

593
00:57:39,764 --> 00:57:50,057
SPEAKER_10: Uh, there are three items on the unanimous consent agenda listed under section 16 actions A through C. Those items are the security operations budget transfer.

594
00:57:50,273 --> 00:57:57,692
SPEAKER_10: The 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, and the Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension for one year.

595
00:57:57,712 --> 00:58:05,532
SPEAKER_10: I do understand that Director Banker would like to offer some amendments to Item B, the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update.

596
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:11,237
SPEAKER_10: And such I will remove, I will move that to a recommended actions, actions, excuse me.

597
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:20,728
SPEAKER_10: If anyone else has a change to discussion on or questions about any of the remaining unanimous consent items, please feel free to advise the chair at this time.

598
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:26,656
SPEAKER_10: And I'll of course be happy to pull the item from unanimous consent for consideration under recommended action.

599
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:28,498
=START-4=
SPEAKER_10: Director Nicholson.

600
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:33,484
Nicholson: The Allied Universal Security Contract, please pull that.

601
00:58:34,085 --> 00:58:34,185
Okay.

602
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:40,383
SPEAKER_10: So item B will be removed and placed into recommended action.

603
00:58:41,444 --> 00:58:47,771
SPEAKER_10: Excuse me, former item C, as I look in real time here, the Allied Universal Security.

604
00:58:47,971 --> 00:58:51,635
SPEAKER_10: Are we okay with security operations, budget transfer?

605
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,505
Whitmore: I would move to approve the remainder of the unanimous consent agenda.
=END-4=

606
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:01,506
Whitmore: Second.

607
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:04,635
SPEAKER_10: Okay, I have Whitmore and then Roush as the second.

608
00:59:05,636 --> 00:59:26,078
SPEAKER_10: Okay, so this is item A for the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $3,845,437.10 between Operated Expenses Lines for Transit Security Services.

609
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,223
SPEAKER_10: Is there any no votes on that?

610
00:59:33,548 --> 00:59:33,848
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

611
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,954
SPEAKER_10: Seeing none, that item will pass 14-0-1.

612
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:44,602
SPEAKER_10: All right, now we're moving on to our recommended action items.

613
00:59:45,363 --> 00:59:51,471
SPEAKER_10: And we're gonna have first on our list, the Allied Universal Security Surface Contract Extension for one year.

614
00:59:51,511 --> 00:59:54,295
SPEAKER_10: Is there a motion?

615
00:59:55,296 --> 00:59:55,697
SPEAKER_10: So moved.

616
00:59:56,117 --> 00:59:56,738
SPEAKER_10: Okay, Nicholson.

617
00:59:58,135 --> 00:59:58,576
SPEAKER_10: In a second.

618
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,077
SPEAKER_10: And Russia.

619
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,040
SPEAKER_10: All right.

620
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:02,941
SPEAKER_10: Any discussion.

621
01:00:04,122 --> 01:00:04,723
=START-5=
SPEAKER_10: Director Nicholson.

622
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:05,564
Nicholson: Yeah.

623
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:08,968
Nicholson: So I just have a quick question about this one that came from a constituent.

624
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:17,759
Nicholson: How many people do we have working from working on our security side from Allied?

625
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,906
Nicholson: And how many do we have from, you know, RTDPD right now?

626
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:24,007
Nicholson: Thank you.

627
01:00:25,248 --> 01:00:25,389
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

628
01:00:25,409 --> 01:00:25,729
SPEAKER_10: Johnson.

629
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:29,765
SPEAKER_16: Yes, I will yield the floor to Chief Martin Gano who can address that question.
=END-5=

630
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:30,146
SPEAKER_16: Thank you.

631
01:00:32,736 --> 01:00:33,458
SPEAKER_10: Chief Martin Gano.

632
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:37,481
SPEAKER_22: I am trying to figure out whether we're going to be hot chat for me.

633
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:38,683
SPEAKER_22: Yes.

634
01:00:38,703 --> 01:00:38,923
SPEAKER_22: Yeah.

635
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:44,214
SPEAKER_22: So technically, in regards to how many ally personnel, it's an hourly contract.

636
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:47,520
SPEAKER_22: So you'd have to take the amount of the hours and obviously divided by 40.

637
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:51,848
SPEAKER_22: It roughly equates to the recommended action for next year.

638
01:00:51,868 --> 01:00:53,812
SPEAKER_22: I think it's about 9100 hours.

639
01:00:53,872 --> 01:00:56,998
SPEAKER_22: So roughly equates about 180 security officers.

640
01:00:56,978 --> 01:01:02,706
SPEAKER_22: Right now we currently have 87 on our staff in regards to post certified police officers.

641
01:01:03,046 --> 01:01:08,453
SPEAKER_22: We have a couple in training and one in the academy who should be probably about 90 by the end of next month.

642
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:10,796
=START-6=
Nicholson: Thank you, secretary.

643
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,202
Nicholson: This is for GMCO Johnson.

644
01:01:16,023 --> 01:01:18,767
Nicholson: What are there any.

645
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:24,837
Nicholson: plans in place or is and please feel free to not answer this as we can't.

646
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:32,070
Nicholson: But I know there's been a drawdown over the last few years in our reliance on allied security.

647
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:38,882
Nicholson: Is there anything in this contract or in your planning around this contract or.

648
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:53,822
Nicholson: anything that can give us guidance on whether we expect that to continue after authorizing this, or are we expecting to stay at, you know, 90, 90 something hundred or 180 people over the next few years?

649
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:55,084
Nicholson: Yes.

650
01:01:55,524 --> 01:01:56,806
SPEAKER_16: Thank you very much for the question.

651
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:00,972
SPEAKER_16: As chief indicated, this is a contract extension and there's hours that are specified.

652
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:06,439
SPEAKER_16: Hence, in reference to the dollar amount that we have here, I would have to come back to the board.

653
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:12,632
SPEAKER_16: as it relates to any type of authorization as we're doing now currently with this contract extension, if that were to be modified.

654
01:02:12,873 --> 01:02:30,197
SPEAKER_16: So on this point in time, it would stay the same unless there's some extenuating circumstances whereby we go out for a solicitation and we're not able to ensure that we're meeting the timeline before, since that's why we're here now with the contract extension quite naturally in doing so.

655
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:34,063
SPEAKER_16: We have to ensure that we have the appropriate staffing levels.
=END-6=

656
01:02:34,398 --> 01:02:39,584
SPEAKER_16: So, I'm talking around and around in circles right now, but the answer would be no at this point in time.

657
01:02:41,165 --> 01:02:41,546
SPEAKER_10: Secretary.

658
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:44,729
SPEAKER_10: Perfect.

659
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,091
SPEAKER_10: Second Vice Chair Whitmore.

660
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:53,519
Whitmore: So, Chief, jog my memory on our goal for the end of the year for sworn officers.

661
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:54,800
Whitmore: It's not 90, right?

662
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,302
Whitmore: It's continuing to grow.

663
01:02:56,862 --> 01:02:57,503
SPEAKER_10: Chief Morrigano.

664
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:59,584
SPEAKER_22: Yeah, so we are budgeted for 150.

665
01:03:00,024 --> 01:03:02,667
SPEAKER_22: We're still in the process of growing to those numbers.

666
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:10,858
SPEAKER_22: So obviously with applications, background checks, everything else, we're heading positively to that.

667
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:12,880
SPEAKER_22: We're putting in more in the academy here in June.

668
01:03:12,941 --> 01:03:15,404
SPEAKER_22: We'll continue to get lateral transfers.

669
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:19,829
SPEAKER_22: I'm sorry, lateral applications from other agencies, officers of experience.

670
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:22,713
SPEAKER_22: So we're hoping to hit that 150 goal by the end of year.

671
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:23,234
Whitmore: All right.

672
01:03:23,254 --> 01:03:23,955
Whitmore: Thank you very much.

673
01:03:23,975 --> 01:03:26,458
Whitmore: I did have the right memory up here.

674
01:03:26,538 --> 01:03:27,439
Whitmore: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

675
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,028
SPEAKER_10: Absolutely.

676
01:03:29,128 --> 01:03:32,351
SPEAKER_10: Any further, well, any further questions or discussions on this?

677
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:33,853
SPEAKER_10: Yeah, Director Riesha.

678
01:03:35,694 --> 01:03:36,035
Paglieri: Thank you, sir.

679
01:03:36,115 --> 01:03:57,274
Paglieri: So I just wanted to note in the in the past upon request, the agency has provided a breakdown of how many just like our security personnel from, you know, our city to contracted and even break down in terms of with our contracted Allied Force like

680
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:03,989
Paglieri: the ones that are authorized to have firearms versus not, and our mental health staff and stuff.

681
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:10,296
Paglieri: So that's something that I think the agency, I'm sure the agency would be happy to provide like that breakdown chart.

682
01:04:10,376 --> 01:04:12,239
Paglieri: I think it's been a little over a year since we've had one.

683
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:21,249
Paglieri: So I just wanted to offer that to those who are interested and just to piggyback on Secretary Nicholson's comments.

684
01:04:22,431 --> 01:04:22,711
Paglieri: Thank you.

685
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:24,013
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Director.

686
01:04:26,335 --> 01:04:26,435
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

687
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:27,717
SPEAKER_10: Any further comments or questions?

688
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:30,118
SPEAKER_10: Okay, seeing none.

689
01:04:30,238 --> 01:04:32,161
SPEAKER_10: So I did have, thank you, Chief.

690
01:04:32,962 --> 01:04:36,066
SPEAKER_10: I did have Nicholson as the mover and Roush as the second.

691
01:04:36,566 --> 01:04:38,569
SPEAKER_10: Are there any no votes on this item?

692
01:04:42,814 --> 01:04:46,739
SPEAKER_10: Okay, seeing none, the item will pass 14-0-1 absent.

693
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:51,866
SPEAKER_10: We are hitting our two hour mark, so we are gonna take a break for our cart employee.

694
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:56,151
SPEAKER_10: Let's shoot to be back here at nine o'clock.

695
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,012
SPEAKER_10: Would that be enough time?

696
01:04:58,409 --> 01:04:58,749

SPEAKER_14: I hear.

720
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:32,057
SPEAKER_14: We had a tower backed up on Friday night.

721
01:09:32,408 --> 01:09:38,217
SPEAKER_14: And, uh, Senator, if you're in the hot quarter, so you know, it's not a big deal.

722
01:09:38,278 --> 01:09:43,626
SPEAKER_14: So, but if my daughter's school, no, they're out there, like an ankle thing.

01:09:46,591 --> 01:09:47,272
I don't know.

725
01:09:47,412 --> 01:09:48,294
I don't know.

01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,783
I don't know.

I don't know.

730
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,187
I don't know.

731
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:57,589
I don't know.

732
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:17,678
SPEAKER_14: Thank you.

733
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:40,452
SPEAKER_14: Thank you.

SPEAKER_14: We're out of time.

736
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:14,428
SPEAKER_14: We're out of time.

737
01:12:14,548 --> 01:12:25,802
SPEAKER_14: We're out of time

738
01:12:36,532 --> 01:12:37,970
I'm sorry.

01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:38,905
SPEAKER_14: Okay.

740
01:13:52,013 --> 01:14:12,233
SPEAKER_14: Thank you very much.

741
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:07,924
SPEAKER_09: Yeah, we're gonna get started.

742
01:15:08,186 --> 01:15:11,430
SPEAKER_14: Have you seen Jack?

743
01:15:46,814 --> 01:16:12,809
SPEAKER_14: All right, folks, we're at 906.

744
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:15,032
SPEAKER_10: We're going to get started.

745
01:16:19,433 --> 01:16:20,655
SPEAKER_10: Director Bouquet, how do you vote?

746
01:16:21,015 --> 01:16:21,536
SPEAKER_10: I mean, yes.

747
01:16:25,262 --> 01:16:31,852
SPEAKER_10: We have a quorum of me and Director Packillary and Director Nicholson and Director Harwick.

748
01:16:47,075 --> 01:16:47,415
SPEAKER_10: All right.

749
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:49,083
SPEAKER_10: Thank you everyone for your patience.

750
01:16:49,483 --> 01:16:52,807
SPEAKER_10: We are now moving on to our next recommended action for tonight.

751
01:16:54,069 --> 01:17:06,664
SPEAKER_10: And that is going to be the recommended action of the 2025-2028 Title VI program update to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

752
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:08,687
SPEAKER_10: Do we have a motion?

753
01:17:09,768 --> 01:17:10,289
Catlin: So moved.

754
01:17:10,849 --> 01:17:11,911
SPEAKER_10: I have Catlin as the mover.

755
01:17:12,932 --> 01:17:13,633
SPEAKER_10: Second, Guzman.

756
01:17:13,933 --> 01:17:15,495
SPEAKER_10: Guzman is the second.

757
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,367
SPEAKER_10: I do understand that Director Banker has two amendments she would like to offer on this item.

758
01:17:21,747 --> 01:17:24,271
SPEAKER_10: Director Banker will take your amendments one at a time.

759
01:17:25,814 --> 01:17:27,777
SPEAKER_10: What is your first amendment, Director Banker?

760
01:17:28,338 --> 01:17:29,159
Benker: Thank you very much.

761
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:36,370
Benker: And I'm glad everybody is now, you know, second wind and we're ready to go on to our

762
01:17:37,244 --> 01:17:39,409
Benker: I don't know, six or seventh hour of meeting.

763
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:43,760
Benker: Actually, I will tell you I have three.

764
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,043
Benker: We'll see how things go.

765
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:46,165
Benker: They're short.

766
01:17:47,168 --> 01:17:49,674
Benker: The first one, well, let me give you a little bit of background.

767
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:50,636
Benker: Okay.

768
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:55,708
Benker: So the background is I met with my four cities back in February and March.

769
01:17:55,688 --> 01:18:00,192
Benker: And of course, you meet with them and you say hi and you say, okay, what are your needs?

770
01:18:00,272 --> 01:18:01,093
Benker: What are your wants?

771
01:18:02,154 --> 01:18:11,943
Benker: I met with all of them and they all gave me a list of basically trying to restore service that was removed during the pandemic.

772
01:18:11,963 --> 01:18:22,533
Benker: And so, of course, as my job as director, I'm trying to work with our staff to try to get that service restored.

773
01:18:23,373 --> 01:18:23,974
Benker: And so,

774
01:18:25,726 --> 01:18:49,371
Benker: One of my questions or issues is I am guessing that when the RTD Board had to make the hard decisions of how to cut service almost in half because of this highly unusual pandemic, perhaps some of these cuts were not done equally across all 15 districts.

775
01:18:49,587 --> 01:18:54,775
SPEAKER_10: Director Banker, I'm sorry to interrupt, just so that we keep in order, could we get a second on?

776
01:18:55,155 --> 01:18:56,838
SPEAKER_10: Could you read the motion and then we get a second?

777
01:18:56,858 --> 01:19:10,378
Benker: Yes, the motion is change the threshold for disproportionate burden and disparate impact from 10% to 20% as it relates to major service changes and consistent with the FTA circular 4702.1B.

778
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:18,430
Benker: And I believe the version that will be voted on is actually the version that

779
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,842
Benker: Mr. Kroll put up for us.

780
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,147
SPEAKER_10: So that's, that's the language right there.

781
01:19:24,187 --> 01:19:31,517
SPEAKER_10: The first motion is to move the move to amend the 2025, 2028 title six program update, such that the threshold for triggering either.

782
01:19:31,977 --> 01:19:40,088
SPEAKER_10: Disappointed Burton or disparate in that fine late night, finding a rising from a major service change from 10% to 20%.

783
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:42,591
SPEAKER_10: Do I have a second?

784
01:19:43,072 --> 01:19:43,433
SPEAKER_10: Second.

785
01:19:43,453 --> 01:19:45,575
SPEAKER_10: Pagliari is the second.

786
01:19:46,457 --> 01:19:46,797
Benker: Thank you.

787
01:19:47,637 --> 01:19:54,125
Benker: So just to continue a little bit more background and then we can start, I guess, the debate here.

788
01:19:55,066 --> 01:20:02,115
Benker: I'm just trying to get service restored that was eliminated during the pandemic.

789
01:20:02,936 --> 01:20:17,475
Benker: And there have been a couple of times now when I have requested and the answer that I have gotten several times is, well, it's going to depend on how the equity analysis calculations come out.

790
01:20:17,455 --> 01:20:32,292
Benker: I'm just trying to find ways where we can perhaps start to restore some of the service that had been eliminated during the pandemic and perhaps do it a little bit quicker and

791
01:20:33,605 --> 01:20:37,794
Benker: and also try to make it not quite so difficult.

792
01:20:38,215 --> 01:20:49,538
Benker: So then what happened, of course, is everyone received about a week, 10 days ago, a letter from the city and county of Broomfield, and their transportation staff went through

793
01:20:49,518 --> 01:20:57,468
Benker: our items quite closely and they sent us all a letter with recommended changes.

794
01:20:58,209 --> 01:21:08,021
Benker: So I've gone through with their changes and that's where I've come up with the three amendments that I'd like to at least talk to the board, see what your thoughts are.

795
01:21:08,642 --> 01:21:11,225
Benker: You know, hopefully it'll pass, but we'll see what happens.

796
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:17,533
Benker: But it's just basically what City and County of Broomfield had found when they did their research is that

797
01:21:17,513 --> 01:21:26,844
Benker: the RTD is using some very conservative calculations compared to some of the other large transit agencies.

798
01:21:27,525 --> 01:21:32,992
Benker: And so I did send you also a copy of the city and county of Broomfields letter just to refresh your memory.

799
01:21:33,993 --> 01:21:41,162
Benker: And so I would like to put forth that the first amendment would be changing the threshold from 10% to 20%.

800
01:21:41,182 --> 01:21:42,663
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Treasurer Baker.

801
01:21:42,804 --> 01:21:45,647
SPEAKER_10: So again, the discussion right now is on the motion

802
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,643
SPEAKER_10: This first motion, the first amendment.

803
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:49,805
SPEAKER_10: Director Catlin.

804
01:21:53,411 --> 01:21:54,313
Catlin: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

805
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:57,759
Catlin: I'd like to ask GM CEO Johnson.

806
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:11,422
Catlin: I heard from someone I don't remember now because it's getting late, but someone said that some of those assumptions made by City and County Broomfield were incorrect.

807
01:22:11,482 --> 01:22:11,622
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

808
01:22:11,662 --> 01:22:12,023
SPEAKER_10: Johnson.

809
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:13,428
SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you very much.

810
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:32,606
SPEAKER_16: Relative to the comments that were made, and thank you very much, Director Catlin, as it relates to the transit agencies that were mentioned being part of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, King County Metro, which is in Greater Seattle and then Chicago Transit Authority.

811
01:22:34,388 --> 01:22:39,192
SPEAKER_16: That information, especially coming from LA Metro as the former Chief Operations Officer there,

812
01:22:39,661 --> 01:22:43,024
SPEAKER_16: This is not correct relative to where we sit.

813
01:22:43,485 --> 01:22:50,932
SPEAKER_16: And more specifically, I do know our director of civil rights when we were going through this quite naturally in the role that he is in.

814
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:56,018
SPEAKER_16: He and his team did a desk audit and worked with colleagues at different transit agencies.

815
01:22:56,038 --> 01:23:01,363
SPEAKER_16: So that's the communique that I did disseminate yesterday upon receiving this information.

816
01:23:01,603 --> 01:23:06,208
SPEAKER_16: So Mr. Green, if you want to just expound succinctly and briefly.

817
01:23:06,661 --> 01:23:12,248
SPEAKER_01: Yes, thank you so much, General Manager and CEO Johnson, to expand upon the response.

818
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:21,740
SPEAKER_01: I just also want to ground us in first state that it is our collective responsibility to make federally compliant and equitable decisions, especially as it relates to service changes.

819
01:23:22,381 --> 01:23:29,530
SPEAKER_01: And in doing that audit, we looked at 22, rather 23 different organizations, which includes the four.

820
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:33,695
SPEAKER_01: Marta, LA Metro, King County, and the Chicago Transit Authority.

821
01:23:34,235 --> 01:23:45,428
SPEAKER_01: And I would say the way to look at the disparate impact or disproportionate burden, the framing of it is how sensitive or less sensitive versus more sensitive, right?

822
01:23:45,629 --> 01:23:47,571
SPEAKER_01: And ours is stacked in the middle.

823
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:49,533
SPEAKER_01: So I want to give you some numbers here.

824
01:23:50,294 --> 01:23:52,817
SPEAKER_01: So for the four that I just mentioned,

825
01:23:53,911 --> 01:24:02,602
SPEAKER_01: Marta has 10%, LA Metro has 5%, King County has 10%, CTA or Chicago Transit Authority has 15%.

826
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:14,637
SPEAKER_01: And then when we rack and stack, look at those 22 different organizations, six out of that 23 have 5% or less, two have 8%,

827
01:24:14,971 --> 01:24:23,929
SPEAKER_01: six, which includes us, or seven, including us, is at 10%, three at 15%, and then three at 20%.

828
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:30,803
SPEAKER_01: And in my over eight years of doing this work, and I'll just say that

829
01:24:30,783 --> 01:24:42,882
SPEAKER_01: When you are setting your policy, you don't want to do a disservice to the spirit and the letter of what we're ultimately trying to achieve, specifically with Title VI.

830
01:24:43,463 --> 01:24:49,112
SPEAKER_01: Title VI is not a stopping mechanism of bringing back or restoring service.

831
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:57,146
SPEAKER_01: There are a lot of different variables, as I mentioned before, with respect to our service development guidelines, our operators resources, so on and so forth.

832
01:24:57,666 --> 01:25:09,138
SPEAKER_01: This is just a mechanism for the agency, such as RTD and the board of directors, so we don't get too far over our skis without discounting populations that are more likely to be transit reliant.

833
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:17,327
SPEAKER_01: So again, it's not a stopping mechanism, but this is just more so to make sure that we are taking into consideration all of our customers.

834
01:25:19,349 --> 01:25:21,713
Guissinger: I've director Ruchin next.

835
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:31,227
Paglieri: Um, I did have a question, but I also, um, treasure banker had her hand up and it was her motion.

836
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:33,611
Paglieri: So I'm happy to, to wait if that was in response.

837
01:25:34,392 --> 01:25:34,973
Guissinger: Treasure banker.

838
01:25:36,335 --> 01:25:42,264
Benker: Um, I, I feel that we are in an extremely unique situation because of the pandemic.

839
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:46,470
Benker: So how can we restore

840
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:52,399
Benker: let's say 40% of the service that had been cut several years ago.

841
01:25:52,840 --> 01:26:00,654
Benker: How can we get back to 2019 when my district, other districts had that service?

842
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:04,662
Benker: And so now we're being told

843
01:26:04,642 --> 01:26:13,772
Benker: that we can't get that service back because of this conservative calculation that we're doing, but we used to have it.

844
01:26:14,934 --> 01:26:22,062
Benker: And so how do we get from where we are now to bringing service back to pre-pandemic levels?

845
01:26:23,403 --> 01:26:23,564
Guissinger: Ms.

846
01:26:23,584 --> 01:26:23,964
Guissinger: Johnson.

847
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:25,886
SPEAKER_16: Yes, thank you very much, Director Banker.

848
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:27,508
SPEAKER_16: That question is better suited for me.

849
01:26:27,548 --> 01:26:31,813
SPEAKER_16: Relative to the service delivery framework that we have,

850
01:26:32,097 --> 01:26:50,798
SPEAKER_16: While Title VI plays a role relative to major service changes as we talk about how we deploy service is based upon a myriad of different factors relative to our revenue service hours, but more specifically at how we use our comprehensive operational analysis specifically as we talk about the SOP.

851
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:57,666
SPEAKER_16: When I came into this organization, it was decided that we were going to look at 85% of what service levels were.

852
01:26:58,321 --> 01:27:00,785
SPEAKER_16: 85% of what service levels were in 2019.

853
01:27:01,546 --> 01:27:10,721
SPEAKER_16: We were in a different time relative to the commuting patterns, relative to how people were working going forward.

854
01:27:11,783 --> 01:27:16,971
SPEAKER_16: What I will share is that we are being very diligent and judicious

855
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:21,798
SPEAKER_16: and how we're applying service because we do want to ensure there's equity.

856
01:27:21,838 --> 01:27:28,370
SPEAKER_16: I'm going to speak a little bit out of school here because I shared this with you yesterday, but I'll say it in this context as well.

857
01:27:28,811 --> 01:27:39,330
SPEAKER_16: As we talk about Longmont and we talk about service, we are looking at that for the fall service change.

858
01:27:39,665 --> 01:28:02,415
SPEAKER_16: That is up to the board quite naturally, but I did want to put that forward because with the restoration of service keeping in mind that all transit agencies across, you know, the US were in these precarious positions and the Federal Transit Administration more or less provided waivers, waivers from the sense of how we were decreasing service due to the fact that we didn't have enough people power.

859
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:08,485
SPEAKER_16: Also, we currently are still working under a waiver as it relates to our spare ratio.

860
01:28:08,585 --> 01:28:18,579
SPEAKER_16: What I mean by that is when you deploy service in the mornings and the afternoons with the peak, you have a certain pullout rate and you're only supposed to have a 20% spare ratio.

861
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:26,250
SPEAKER_16: We've deviated from that and have a waiver and we're right sizing the fleet as we move forward.

862
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:32,318
SPEAKER_16: So while you're bringing up these points, as you indicated, we are in uncharted territory or were.

863
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,942
SPEAKER_16: And we're coming back from that.

864
01:28:34,924 --> 01:28:47,185
SPEAKER_16: We are looking at where there are needs relative to the entire area from an origin and destination vantage point just by virtue of how our service area is going forward.

865
01:28:47,686 --> 01:28:51,032
SPEAKER_16: So I'm not providing this to say I don't.

866
01:28:51,012 --> 01:28:53,254
SPEAKER_16: understand what you're trying to do.

867
01:28:53,275 --> 01:28:58,961
SPEAKER_16: And as I share it with you, I do clearly and we want to work within the frameworks that we have.

868
01:28:59,602 --> 01:29:05,428
SPEAKER_16: But a whole cell of restoration of what was happening in 2019, that wouldn't be fiscally responsible.

869
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:13,577
SPEAKER_16: And I say it from the vantage point of, we had a lot of service that was out on the street, maybe that yielded one passenger boarding per hour.

870
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:15,552
SPEAKER_16: but that was out on the street.

871
01:29:15,852 --> 01:29:19,316
SPEAKER_16: Does that really yield the return on investment going forward?

872
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:26,965
SPEAKER_16: Hence, that's why there were modifications relative to reallocation of services going forward.

873
01:29:27,386 --> 01:29:28,847
Benker: Okay, but if I can.

874
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,930
Benker: Treasure, yeah.

875
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:35,015
Benker: Some of the issues that you just raised are important.

876
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:35,816
Benker: There's no doubt.

877
01:29:36,156 --> 01:29:40,421
Benker: However, I don't believe it goes to the equity calculation.

878
01:29:42,884 --> 01:29:43,024
Benker: I

879
01:29:45,080 --> 01:30:00,760
Benker: What I think is important to to hear from staff and I know we're going to be talking about this in our retreat, which is I'm looking forward to that is if it's possible for us to go back to over 100 million riders in three years.

880
01:30:01,432 --> 01:30:20,994
Benker: what barriers are we facing to try to do that so that we can go from 65 million to 100, 106, 110, and start quickly, or not quickly, but faster than what we're doing now to get back up to higher service levels.

881
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:23,117
SPEAKER_16: Ms.

882
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:23,497
SPEAKER_16: Johnson.

883
01:30:23,778 --> 01:30:24,178
SPEAKER_16: Thank you.

884
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:27,642
SPEAKER_16: There's a couple of external factors that play into that.

885
01:30:27,993 --> 01:30:34,926
SPEAKER_16: quite naturally when we look at the central business district and the occupancy rate and the lack of people commuting in.

886
01:30:35,427 --> 01:30:47,309
SPEAKER_16: It's important to keep in mind that there was, I'm forgetting the name, but the city and county of Denver did the report relative to the usage rate in looking at the occupancy levels.

887
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:51,537
SPEAKER_16: But more specifically, what's important to note is that

888
01:30:51,517 --> 01:30:56,726
SPEAKER_16: there hasn't been the level of bounce back relative to this central business district.

889
01:30:57,949 --> 01:31:08,388
SPEAKER_16: I believe the last time I looked at stats, city and county at Denver was in the bottom three out of out of 50 major cities.

890
01:31:08,828 --> 01:31:12,495
SPEAKER_16: And then as we know, the state of Colorado is the number

891
01:31:14,078 --> 01:31:18,923
SPEAKER_16: is the third state relative to remote work and then City of Boulder is number one.

892
01:31:19,344 --> 01:31:27,092
SPEAKER_16: While I factor that in, we don't have the same operating environment that we did in 2019 or prior to the pandemic.

893
01:31:27,452 --> 01:31:36,882
SPEAKER_16: How do we get back to the transit usage that we had before?

894
01:31:37,563 --> 01:31:41,487
SPEAKER_16: I think there's so many extenuating factors going forward

895
01:31:41,838 --> 01:32:05,374
SPEAKER_16: relative to how we're delivering the service, but also having the vehicle capacity, the people power, and the reliability aspect, which bring us full circle to state of good repair and the other aspects that have caused people to shy away from utilizing our network because we were sacrificing one element for something else relative to delivery.

896
01:32:05,894 --> 01:32:08,959
SPEAKER_16: And I bring that up because as we talk about the people power,

897
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:33,588
SPEAKER_16: we clearly saw that our operating workforce was decreasing in 2016 as it was across the country, but more specifically, having other ancillary services that were readily available where people whereby were working extra shifts and then we didn't have enough people for daily pullout on those other routes.

898
01:32:34,009 --> 01:32:37,613
SPEAKER_16: And so I'm providing that context to say

899
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:57,930
SPEAKER_16: to get back, there are certain things that the agency can surely do, but to get back to those numbers within the period of time that you specify would be very challenging just because of the different operating characteristics that have been altered by factors that are no fault of this agency's.

900
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:00,440
Paglieri: Thanks, sir.

901
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,864
Paglieri: So I have a question for legal.

902
01:33:05,285 --> 01:33:15,475
Paglieri: So recognizing this has to be submitted shortly, I want to be careful of my words.

903
01:33:17,297 --> 01:33:28,187
Paglieri: Can we make significant changes at this juncture after all of the public comment process or

904
01:33:28,741 --> 01:33:33,908
Paglieri: Is that something that we, I guess, I don't know if it's a yes, no, or a gray area.

905
01:33:33,988 --> 01:33:36,131
Paglieri: And I wanted to get a bit of feedback on that.

906
01:33:36,591 --> 01:33:41,217
Paglieri: Now, to disparage the motion, I just also want to understand the potential legal implications.

907
01:33:46,324 --> 01:33:48,687
SPEAKER_16: I will address that question.

908
01:33:49,228 --> 01:33:51,891
SPEAKER_16: And then I'll ask Mr. Green to expound.

909
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:55,035
SPEAKER_16: I think if anything, as we talk about public engagement,

910
01:33:55,606 --> 01:34:19,386
SPEAKER_16: and talk about the agencies, the perception of the agency being trustworthy, going forward and getting public engagement quite naturally and then not leveraging it for the betterment of the constituencies that we serve, I think pose a risk as it relates to the agency in reference of public perception.

911
01:34:19,855 --> 01:34:25,784
SPEAKER_16: There is leeway relative to the circular in light of what can be done.

912
01:34:25,864 --> 01:34:38,945
SPEAKER_16: We are sitting here on May 28th, recognizing that we have a new administration and that we do need to have a Title VI program that's submitted and we have been engaged on this topic since January.

913
01:34:39,406 --> 01:34:42,030
SPEAKER_16: That's not to negate any amendments or anything like that.

914
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:44,614
SPEAKER_16: I am just trying to answer the question.

915
01:34:44,797 --> 01:34:51,965
SPEAKER_16: But more specifically, Mr. Green, since you are very well-versed in 4702.1B, I would yield the floor to you.

916
01:34:52,025 --> 01:34:56,069
SPEAKER_16: And that's the citation for the FTA circular that we're talking about.

917
01:34:56,509 --> 01:34:56,690
SPEAKER_01: Yes.

918
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,872
SPEAKER_01: Thank you so much, GM CEO Johnson.

919
01:34:58,932 --> 01:35:00,133
SPEAKER_01: You.

920
01:35:04,538 --> 01:35:06,940
SPEAKER_01: Apology, the positive microphone.

921
01:35:07,221 --> 01:35:07,521
SPEAKER_01: Yes.

922
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:08,322
SPEAKER_01: Apologies.

923
01:35:08,382 --> 01:35:12,306
SPEAKER_01: But to piggyback off what GM CEO Johnson has noted,

924
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:20,373
SPEAKER_01: That is, I would couch that as the bigger risk is when we think about establishing policy, right?

925
01:35:20,433 --> 01:35:25,047
SPEAKER_01: As it relates to 4702.1B, the FTA Title VI circular.

926
01:35:25,432 --> 01:35:34,847
SPEAKER_01: it does call upon the agency to do a lot of outreach and public involvement to ensure that we are collecting that feedback to inform decisions.

927
01:35:35,408 --> 01:35:48,790
SPEAKER_01: So at the ground level, if we think about public involvement in Title VI, it's part and parcel of what the Title VI program stands for, ensuring that folks in the community are able to inform the decision, such as the policy.

928
01:35:49,495 --> 01:35:53,620
SPEAKER_01: So, but with respect to the circular, we can, i.e.

929
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,885
SPEAKER_01: the board of directors could adopt a different threshold.

930
01:35:57,905 --> 01:36:11,001
SPEAKER_01: So for example, the one that director banker has put forth, although we received a lot of feedback indicating the 25% threshold and 36 month cumulative change, et cetera, all that's packaged in within the proposed update.

931
01:36:11,761 --> 01:36:19,030
SPEAKER_01: There is an exception to that within the circular where it states where the board is ultimately approving the policy.

932
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:21,318
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.

933
01:36:22,179 --> 01:36:26,085
SPEAKER_10: Director Gysinger and then Director Larson.

934
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,212
SPEAKER_10: Director Larson and then Harwick.

935
01:36:33,395 --> 01:36:33,816
Larsen: Thank you.

936
01:36:35,378 --> 01:36:50,400
Larsen: I guess my question is, I looked through a lot of the Title VI updates that were for service changes, this Title VI analysis that were in the

937
01:36:50,583 --> 01:37:13,095
Larsen: the board packet, and it seemed like most of the time we, you know, sometimes there was a little bit of disparate impact on one route or the other, but mostly it sort of ended up that in the aggregate there wasn't really much, and there were legitimate justifications for what there was on an individual basis.

938
01:37:13,896 --> 01:37:18,042
Larsen: I guess my, you know, my basic question is with

939
01:37:18,393 --> 01:37:26,480
Larsen: with regard to this update and the changes that we're proposing, are we just, I mean, is there really a problem here?

940
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,682
Larsen: Are we just making this harder for ourselves?

941
01:37:28,742 --> 01:37:39,872
Larsen: Because it doesn't seem like we're trying to generally start out making service changes with an intention of causing disparate impact one place or the other.

942
01:37:39,933 --> 01:37:43,716
Larsen: We make them, I guess, for a variety of reasons.

943
01:37:44,677 --> 01:37:48,180
Larsen: And on balance, they don't really seem to

944
01:37:48,785 --> 01:38:01,669
Larsen: under our current setup, you know, ever, ever sort of look like they were, you know, there were somehow some, you know, bad intent or just inattention to who we're serving.

945
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:07,840
Larsen: It seems like we do a lot of analysis and then basically do what we would have done anyways.

946
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:28,974
Larsen: Why put sort of a greater burden, sort of regulate ourselves more than we have to, and why not just give us the freedom to operate as we would as much as we can, given that we don't, you know, it doesn't necessarily seem like it's been a problem for a long time, at least from what I could see.

947
01:38:29,014 --> 01:38:37,405
Larsen: I mean, there weren't that many Title VI complaints that I could, that I, in the information that was provided.

948
01:38:37,874 --> 01:38:38,256
Larsen: I don't know.

949
01:38:39,442 --> 01:38:42,537
Larsen: My basic question is why would we make things harder for ourselves?

950
01:38:42,898 --> 01:38:43,140
Larsen: Thanks.

951
01:38:44,908 --> 01:38:45,793
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Ms.

952
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:46,315
SPEAKER_10: Johnson.

953
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:48,401
SPEAKER_16: Thank you very much.

954
01:38:48,461 --> 01:39:05,298
SPEAKER_16: The one thing I would share Director Larson, as we look at the modification that's been put forward for your consideration, like a 36 month period, as we're adding back service, there could be unforeseen consequences as we do them in a segmented fashion.

955
01:39:05,618 --> 01:39:15,188
SPEAKER_16: And so that's one element as a whole, because if we're making modifications going forward, there could be an adverse impact.

956
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:17,911
SPEAKER_16: And so that's what I would showcase there.

957
01:39:18,692 --> 01:39:30,728
SPEAKER_16: Keeping in mind to the point that you raised, when we talk about the aspect of DIDB, it's what can we do as an agency to help mitigate that to your point going forward.

958
01:39:30,949 --> 01:39:40,301
SPEAKER_16: But it's just to ensure that we have a program whereby we are not causing undue harm to certain population segments.

959
01:39:42,764 --> 01:39:43,285
Guissinger: Director Larson.

960
01:39:45,307 --> 01:39:53,215
Larsen: But it just seems like when I was reading the documents that there, we, there's always a legitimate to justification for, for everything we want to do.

961
01:39:53,235 --> 01:40:01,124
Larsen: Or we, you know, it's always, there's always this, we'll have a disparate impact, but we have a legitimate justification for, for doing this.

962
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:02,425
Larsen: So we're, we're just going to do it.

963
01:40:02,966 --> 01:40:11,955
Larsen: I mean, how many times, how many times in the last however many years has it been that we did this analysis, we looked at all the service changes we wanted to do.

964
01:40:12,323 --> 01:40:16,770
Larsen: And we were like, okay, no, we're not going to do this list of service changes.

965
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:23,039
Larsen: We're going to, you know, cross out these ones because the aggregate impact is too much.

966
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,843
Larsen: I mean, is it, is it, is that happened?

967
01:40:26,043 --> 01:40:32,733
Larsen: I just didn't, from what I read in the packet, I didn't, I don't know if I caught everything, but it didn't seem like there were a lot of those.

968
01:40:32,994 --> 01:40:41,807
Larsen: Or is this happening kind of at an earlier stage where when Bob in service says, let's just send a bunch of buses to Cherry Hills Village, somebody says, no, no.

969
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:46,365
Larsen: That's not going to work out before it even gets to this point.

970
01:40:47,566 --> 01:40:47,847
Larsen: You know?

971
01:40:50,269 --> 01:40:50,750
SPEAKER_16: I'm sorry.

972
01:40:51,491 --> 01:40:52,492
SPEAKER_16: Thank you for the question.

973
01:40:52,532 --> 01:40:53,613
SPEAKER_16: It's for me.

974
01:40:53,753 --> 01:40:59,179
SPEAKER_16: I've only been here for five years and I came in the height of the pandemic and we've been adding back service and not.

975
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:09,651
SPEAKER_16: So that's difficult for me to answer just because we have not been in a situation whereby

976
01:41:10,357 --> 01:41:11,459
SPEAKER_16: It's been the opposite.

977
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,403
SPEAKER_16: Carl, do you have anything to add?

978
01:41:15,004 --> 01:41:15,405
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

979
01:41:15,425 --> 01:41:16,927
SPEAKER_01: I would just highlight chair bouquet.

980
01:41:16,947 --> 01:41:34,153
SPEAKER_01: If I may, since January 2023, there was about 270 service change recommendations that have been implemented and roughly 26, 24, 26 of those 276 were considered major service changes.

981
01:41:34,657 --> 01:41:41,608
SPEAKER_01: And out of that 26 to director Larson's point, there has been 13 potential disparate impacts.

982
01:41:42,449 --> 01:41:46,555
SPEAKER_01: And to your point, there was a substantial legitimate justification.

983
01:41:46,575 --> 01:41:56,631
SPEAKER_01: And going it's, I wouldn't necessarily couch it as an exercise, but I would say we were the transit equity office within within the civil rights division.

984
01:41:56,881 --> 01:42:01,415
SPEAKER_01: works hand in glove with Jesse Carter and his team service development.

985
01:42:02,177 --> 01:42:09,861
SPEAKER_01: And as we are having those conversations after the service change recommendation are put forth and we analyze it if there is a potential disparate impact.

986
01:42:10,212 --> 01:42:15,922
SPEAKER_01: More often than not, to your point, and to my earlier, earlier point, that Title VI is not a stopping mechanism.

987
01:42:16,443 --> 01:42:27,202
SPEAKER_01: And I wouldn't necessarily state that it's burdensome because it's one of our responsibilities to make sure that we are equitably distributing services across our service area.

988
01:42:27,863 --> 01:42:35,376
SPEAKER_01: But more often not, there is a legitimate justification to put forth the service recommendation as it is presented to the board.

989
01:42:38,073 --> 01:42:38,474
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

990
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:39,837
SPEAKER_10: Director.

991
01:42:42,021 --> 01:42:42,121
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

992
01:42:42,142 --> 01:42:48,515
SPEAKER_10: Uh, I had director Harwick and just as a reminder, we're currently in discussion regarding this first motion.

993
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:53,044
SPEAKER_10: Just want to make sure that, um, first amendment, excuse me, first amendment.

994
01:42:53,064 --> 01:42:56,572
SPEAKER_10: So make sure, uh, comments are around that.

995
01:42:57,033 --> 01:42:57,634
SPEAKER_10: Director Harwick.

996
01:42:59,369 --> 01:43:10,030
Harwick: Mine will be comments about this, but also moving forward as well, because I am in support of this, this title six, not, not the amendment, just as just a straight title six.

997
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:15,741
Harwick: Um, you know, I, I don't think moving, uh, from, from 10 or from.

998
01:43:15,721 --> 01:43:21,028
Harwick: from 10% to 20% is going to increase ridership.

999
01:43:21,248 --> 01:43:31,441
Harwick: I think that right now it allows our staff the ability to really center equity and effectively protect our communities.

1000
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:38,269
Harwick: And while I get that Broomfield feels like they want more service, I don't think this is going to get it there.

1001
01:43:38,907 --> 01:43:43,928
Harwick: I think this is the 11th hour and I think that it's really imperative that our staff has worked extremely hard on this.

1002
01:43:43,948 --> 01:43:49,390
Harwick: They've had to jump through a whole variety of hoops.

1003
01:43:50,095 --> 01:44:15,293
Harwick: bunch of different board members and I think that we're here, they've done an incredible job and I think that this is, they are the subject matter experts and it's our opportunity here to put our trust in them, our belief in them and I think that we owe them that and we have been talking about this since January so we're well into four months and I think that it is key that we support this

1004
01:44:15,273 --> 01:44:24,211
Harwick: Title six as is and we allow them to move forward and we allow them to start you know handing us off to the feds and we can move forward and That's where I'm at.

1005
01:44:24,331 --> 01:44:24,612
Harwick: Thank you.

1006
01:44:24,972 --> 01:44:34,952
=START-7=
SPEAKER_10: Thank you director any further conversation on this amendment Secretary Nicholson So this is for our deputy general counsel

1007
01:44:35,388 --> 01:44:47,544
Nicholson: If we were to pass this tonight, what's the legal risk to the agency when it comes to our federal Title VI approval as a result of this change?

1008
01:44:47,704 --> 01:45:00,101
Nicholson: Like, is this gonna have any, would this have any legal repercussions or could we just, do we feel pretty comfortable that we could do this and not have the federal government take issue with it?

1009
01:45:01,482 --> 01:45:03,385
SPEAKER_10: In regards to the amendment secretary?

1010
01:45:03,405 --> 01:45:03,505
Yeah.
=END-7=

1011
01:45:06,910 --> 01:45:07,491
SPEAKER_10: deputy counsel.

1012
01:45:11,415 --> 01:45:11,755
SPEAKER_12: There we go.

1013
01:45:11,775 --> 01:45:12,255
SPEAKER_12: Excuse me.

1014
01:45:12,816 --> 01:45:14,177
SPEAKER_12: Uh, thank you, director Nicholson.

1015
01:45:14,738 --> 01:45:16,019
SPEAKER_12: Um, I, I don't have concerns.

1016
01:45:18,922 --> 01:45:19,323
Guissinger: Secretary.

1017
01:45:21,165 --> 01:45:21,725
Guissinger: That is all.

1018
01:45:22,806 --> 01:45:23,907
Guissinger: Uh, yeah, treasure banker.

1019
01:45:25,389 --> 01:45:33,357
Benker: Um, here is where I do not understand in 2019.

1020
01:45:35,716 --> 01:45:37,201
Benker: We had the service.

1021
01:45:38,506 --> 01:45:42,902
Benker: My area, my district as many others have grown.

1022
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:46,013
Benker: There's no

1023
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:55,277
Benker: For example, the town of Erie, just a few years ago was 20,000, now it's 40,000, like two, three years later.

1024
01:45:55,297 --> 01:46:03,345
Benker: And when I met with Erie, they said, hey, we're planning going to 80,000 in just the next couple of years.

1025
01:46:04,086 --> 01:46:14,717
Benker: I also read in the Denver Post that the town of Erie is the 15th fastest city in the country in terms of population growth.

1026
01:46:15,727 --> 01:46:31,322
Benker: So my question is, is if we had the service prior to the pandemic and it was serving all of these communities, why is it so difficult to get that restored?

1027
01:46:35,466 --> 01:46:36,086
SPEAKER_10: Just Johnson.

1028
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,392
SPEAKER_16: So thank you, Director Banker.

1029
01:46:44,667 --> 01:47:04,808
SPEAKER_16: This, what I'm going to say goes back to the previous comments that I had before, recognizing that RTD is a regional service and the way the service was outlined for all intents and purposes was bringing individuals into the central business district.

1030
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:12,936
SPEAKER_16: That level of ridership isn't there and that's not to negate that there

1031
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:19,258
SPEAKER_16: is some elements centered on a need to move people to and fro.

1032
01:47:19,318 --> 01:47:23,047
SPEAKER_16: Hence, that's why there was the advent of the partnership program.

1033
01:47:23,388 --> 01:47:30,486
SPEAKER_16: And one of the reasons why Erie basically wanted to join the district because they were looking to put forward an application

1034
01:47:30,837 --> 01:47:56,018
SPEAKER_16: for the partnership program, and I know you're just using that as an example, but just wanted to further iterate that because for all intents and purposes, as we're looking to provide mobility options, the intent behind the partnership program was more or less like a pilot in the sense that let's see how many people are utilizing this means of connection

1035
01:47:56,656 --> 01:48:08,651
SPEAKER_16: prior to putting out a 40 foot or a 60 foot Arctic that costs more money per revenue hour and doesn't yield the same return on investment relative to the cost per boarding.

1036
01:48:10,253 --> 01:48:13,037
SPEAKER_16: Does that help or did I complicated more?

1037
01:48:13,077 --> 01:48:16,661
SPEAKER_16: Okay.

1038
01:48:16,682 --> 01:48:17,082
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

1039
01:48:17,222 --> 01:48:19,105
SPEAKER_10: Director Guzman and then Director Geisinger.

1040
01:48:19,846 --> 01:48:23,791
Guzman: So I would urge us to cleanly pass this through tonight.

1041
01:48:24,191 --> 01:48:26,494
Guzman: I'm getting back to the motion before us.

1042
01:48:26,997 --> 01:48:39,312
Guzman: I would like to ask one question, which is the 10 to 20% is still not going to prevent us from adding services.

1043
01:48:40,293 --> 01:48:55,232
Guzman: It is simply a filter through which to look, if I understand this correctly, that we are not unintentionally harming community with protected status under the Title VI legislation,

1044
01:48:55,634 --> 01:49:02,843
Guzman: or those that might be disproportionately burdened or impacted by their financial and economic status within the region.

1045
01:49:03,964 --> 01:49:16,219
Guzman: The only purpose we need to pass this is because it is due, because it is the law, and it is how we ensure that we are able to receive our federal funding, which is approximately 25% of our total budget.

1046
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:20,764
Guzman: So I just want to make sure I understand.

1047
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:25,827
Guzman: what has been presented here does not tell the board no, we cannot provide transit service.

1048
01:49:26,608 --> 01:49:46,195
Guzman: It is simply a way to look at it and say we may have an issue if it reaches a certain threshold that we need to be aware of in order to be able to approve changes in service, fair changes or other changes that would create a potential burden on specific

1049
01:49:47,137 --> 01:49:50,501
Guzman: communities as defined within the Title VI language.

1050
01:49:50,701 --> 01:49:55,027
Guzman: Is that correct or am I completely lost in this conversation?

1051
01:49:56,849 --> 01:49:57,590
SPEAKER_01: Chair, are we okay for me?

1052
01:49:57,970 --> 01:49:59,031
SPEAKER_10: Absolutely, Mr. Green.

1053
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:03,136
SPEAKER_01: If I'm tracking Director Guzman, I'll try to answer the question from what I hear.

1054
01:50:03,196 --> 01:50:05,880
SPEAKER_01: And if you have any double back, then I'll respond to it.

1055
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:12,047
SPEAKER_01: So the current 10%, so if we think about different thresholds for DIDB,

1056
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:41,983
SPEAKER_01: And we are in, based off the desk audit, we're in the middle tier of having a threshold that allows us as an agency, which ultimately each service equity analysis is approved by the board of directors, where it allows us, again, to your point, when we're thinking about BIPOC or Black Indigenous people of color, for disparate impact or loan communities, for disproportionate burden, it allows us to make a well-informed, eyes-wide open decision

1057
01:50:42,402 --> 01:50:46,948
SPEAKER_01: of better understanding of who's more likely to receive more of the impact.

1058
01:50:47,469 --> 01:50:56,020
SPEAKER_01: And when we're thinking about service increases, we're thinking about the fair share of benefits, where if there is a service reduction, we're looking at who's more likely to receive more of the burden.

1059
01:50:56,540 --> 01:51:06,173
SPEAKER_01: So to your point, Director Guzman, it allows us to just get a better understanding of the level of impact that we can have on a particular community.

1060
01:51:06,594 --> 01:51:09,237
SPEAKER_01: It does not prevent us from moving forward.

1061
01:51:11,191 --> 01:51:11,612
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.

1062
01:51:11,632 --> 01:51:18,953
Guzman: I would just urge a no vote and let's move on to the policy.

1063
01:51:19,856 --> 01:51:20,317
SPEAKER_10: All right.

1064
01:51:21,139 --> 01:51:25,993
SPEAKER_10: Dr. Geisinger, I'm going to have you as our final comment on this specific amendment.

1065
01:51:26,227 --> 01:51:27,389
SPEAKER_00: I'll be super quick.

1066
01:51:27,409 --> 01:51:33,637
SPEAKER_00: At that last explanation that Mr. Green gave helped me in terms of just giving us a better holistic view.

1067
01:51:33,657 --> 01:51:41,487
SPEAKER_00: But I shared Director Larson's sort of view of are we just making this harder for ourselves, creating more work?

1068
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:44,051
SPEAKER_00: Is that not right?

1069
01:51:45,593 --> 01:51:46,534
SPEAKER_01: Mr. Green?

1070
01:51:46,554 --> 01:51:48,276
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's a great follow up question.

1071
01:51:48,296 --> 01:51:49,618
SPEAKER_01: I would say it

1072
01:51:50,847 --> 01:52:18,711
SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't say it's making it harder because when we think about what we're ultimately trying to achieve and a percentage that's mathematically consistent relative to the populations that we serve, so in doing this work, given my background, right, in doing an assessment of whether if we, and that's why we didn't want to make any modifications of increasing or decreasing the major service change, we just wanted to keep it consistent, is

1073
01:52:18,978 --> 01:52:30,132
SPEAKER_01: with doing this work, or even doing an analysis of previous run boards or equity analyses, 20% is something where you wouldn't see anything.

1074
01:52:31,393 --> 01:52:42,066
SPEAKER_01: And that's a disservice when we think about our populations within our service area, specifically as we look at our census data where 38.1% is BIPOC, 13.1%.

1075
01:52:42,653 --> 01:52:45,596
SPEAKER_01: or 14.1 rather for low income, right?

1076
01:52:45,716 --> 01:52:49,960
SPEAKER_01: And then if we look at the onboard survey, 56% are considered BIPOC.

1077
01:52:50,981 --> 01:53:11,800
SPEAKER_01: And so I say all that to say, just to wrap it up, is that 10% threshold for DINDB allows us to make an informed decision that is backed by not only our desk audit, but the years of experience and knowing, having a better understanding of ultimately what we're trying to achieve.

1078
01:53:14,345 --> 01:53:14,765
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.

1079
01:53:15,086 --> 01:53:15,406
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

1080
01:53:15,927 --> 01:53:17,628
SPEAKER_10: All right, let's do a roll call vote.

1081
01:53:17,648 --> 01:53:27,759
SPEAKER_10: As a reminder, it is the First Amendment being introduced, as you all can see on that screen, with Director Banker as the mover and Director Pagulieri as the second.

1082
01:53:27,859 --> 01:53:30,541
SPEAKER_10: Again, we're voting on this First Amendment.

1083
01:53:31,342 --> 01:53:31,923
SPEAKER_10: Treasure Banker.

1084
01:53:32,784 --> 01:53:33,004
Benker: Yes.

1085

Catlin: No.

1090
01:53:44,348 --> 01:53:44,729

Whitmore: No.

1109
01:54:14,048 --> 01:54:15,471
SPEAKER_10: I mean, yes, but the motion will fail.

1110
01:54:16,953 --> 01:54:20,099
SPEAKER_10: And we have three to 10.

1111
01:54:21,342 --> 01:54:22,965
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

1112
01:54:22,985 --> 01:54:23,466
SPEAKER_10: Moving on.

1113
01:54:23,726 --> 01:54:24,307
SPEAKER_10: Yes, Director.

1114
01:54:24,347 --> 01:54:26,491
Benker: I would like to withdraw the next two amendments.

1115
01:54:26,912 --> 01:54:27,614
SPEAKER_10: Next two amendments.

1116

Benker: Yes.

1117
01:54:28,635 --> 01:54:29,617
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

1118
01:54:29,637 --> 01:54:32,142
SPEAKER_10: The next two amendments have been withdrawn.

1119
01:54:33,522 --> 01:54:35,067
Larsen: Okay, they were never introduced.

1120
01:54:35,107 --> 01:54:41,829
Larsen: So they're not really with John, but now you would return back to the debate on the main motion, which is to approve the title six program update.

1121
01:54:42,251 --> 01:54:42,632
SPEAKER_10: Excellent.

1122
01:54:43,174 --> 01:54:44,418
SPEAKER_10: Back to the main motion at hand.

1123
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:45,642
SPEAKER_10: Director Keith.

1124
01:54:47,174 --> 01:54:54,424
=START-8=
Nicholson: So I contemplated a no vote out of principle on this action.

1125
01:54:54,484 --> 01:54:57,207
Nicholson: There's a few things going on.

1126
01:54:57,247 --> 01:55:00,412
Nicholson: First of all, it should never get to the last minute.

1127
01:55:00,932 --> 01:55:06,099
Nicholson: The board should never be asked to pass things because it's due in two days.

1128
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:12,608
Nicholson: And I know there's a lot of things that go into the delay, but that's just not the right

1129
01:55:13,077 --> 01:55:19,510
Nicholson: That's not the right urgency to place on the board act.

1130
01:55:19,810 --> 01:55:26,884
Nicholson: Secondly, I don't know very much about this topic and I have sat in on two operations committee meetings.

1131
01:55:28,327 --> 01:55:29,550
Nicholson: I've talked to a bunch of people.

1132
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:32,335
Nicholson: I've done my own research.

1133
01:55:32,315 --> 01:55:37,602
Nicholson: And I still am looking for a succinct description of the program.

1134
01:55:37,642 --> 01:55:43,230
Nicholson: I would note that there was a wonderful book written by Robert Carrow.

1135
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:44,372
Nicholson: It's called The Power Broker.

1136
01:55:44,612 --> 01:55:46,855
Nicholson: I'm sure a lot of people in this room know it.

1137
01:55:47,596 --> 01:55:54,205
Nicholson: Talks a lot about bad policy decisions on disadvantaged communities.

1138
01:55:54,185 --> 01:56:02,324
Nicholson: and how those decisions were made and the harmful outcome of those decisions.

1139
01:56:03,767 --> 01:56:08,278
Nicholson: It is 15 pages shorter than our packet tonight.

1140
01:56:08,731 --> 01:56:18,289
Nicholson: He won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1200 page treatise on impact by public infrastructure.

1141
01:56:18,309 --> 01:56:25,423
Nicholson: I would request that when we're passing along documents as part of a packet,

1142
01:56:25,403 --> 01:56:30,088
Nicholson: it needs to have a point and it should be summarized from the committee for the rest of the board.

1143
01:56:30,148 --> 01:56:35,373
Nicholson: Simply passing things along for us does not help me understand this better.

1144
01:56:35,393 --> 01:56:42,580
Nicholson: I'm probably a yes vote tonight, but I was a no vote until about an hour and a half ago.

1145
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:52,170
Nicholson: And so I just, when you are putting together packets on complex questions for the board,

1146
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:56,376
Nicholson: Given us reams of paper does not help us get to a better decision.

1147
01:56:57,097 --> 01:57:09,856
Nicholson: So that's something request for the two three ish committee chairs As you're putting together topics like this and that would be very helpful for me to make better Decisions.

1148
01:57:10,437 --> 01:57:10,697
Nicholson: Thanks.

1149
01:57:11,018 --> 01:57:11,719
SPEAKER_10: Thank you director.
=END-8=

1150
01:57:11,839 --> 01:57:14,703
SPEAKER_10: Okay any further comments or questions on the main motion?

1151
01:57:15,765 --> 01:57:20,892
Guzman: Dr. Guzman, I would just like to mention that the Denver City Council unanimously

1152
01:57:21,496 --> 01:57:27,163
Guzman: submitted a proclamation for RTD on May 19th, 2025.

1153
01:57:27,263 --> 01:57:28,845
Guzman: It is in the director's emails.

1154
01:57:29,506 --> 01:57:46,086
Guzman: It was sent over by city council that they wholeheartedly support the 2025, 2028 title six program to include the proposed updates to major service change, disparate impact and fair equity policies, as well as updates to RTD's public participation plan and language access plan, which we are voting on now.

1155
01:57:46,808 --> 01:57:51,073
Guzman: and that the clerk and recorder of the city and county of Denver did affix the seal making it official.

1156
01:57:52,275 --> 01:57:54,017
Guzman: I believe that that is necessary.

1157
01:57:54,037 --> 01:58:12,681
Guzman: There's a whole proclamation, you can read through it, but former board director Lewis, sorry, we had two Lewises and I wanted to make sure I said it right, did work with city council member Serena Gutierrez Gonzalez and

1158
01:58:13,285 --> 01:58:17,534
Guzman: The unanimity of that vote is remarkable from our city council.

1159
01:58:17,634 --> 01:58:21,081
Guzman: So they stand behind this as well with us to move this forward.

1160
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:22,063
Guzman: Thank you.

1161
01:58:22,083 --> 01:58:22,905
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, director.

1162
01:58:23,687 --> 01:58:24,388
Larsen: Director Larson.

1163
01:58:26,312 --> 01:58:27,374
Larsen: I'm going to be a no vote.

1164
01:58:27,815 --> 01:58:29,218
Larsen: I think.

1165
01:58:29,738 --> 01:58:33,864
Larsen: I think it's kind of like I said, we're constraining our freedom to operate.

1166
01:58:33,924 --> 01:58:36,928
Larsen: We're spending a lot of energy and effort to track this.

1167
01:58:37,308 --> 01:58:51,007
Larsen: And I know the intentions behind that are good, but I think just as a matter of principle, we shouldn't be sort of trying to over, or regulating ourselves more.

1168
01:58:51,428 --> 01:58:54,632
Larsen: We should be thinking is, we have not,

1169
01:58:54,612 --> 01:59:07,170
Larsen: There's not really a lot of evidence that we have disparately ever had any recent plans to expand service or decrease service in a way that

1170
01:59:07,623 --> 01:59:12,349
Larsen: that causes a disparate impact on these populations.

1171
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:31,133
Larsen: And I honestly believe that if we focused 100% just on increasing ridership, which is what I think we should be doing, and not trying to expand our sort of purview about when, you know, when maybe we shouldn't increase ridership, I don't know if we really, if it's legitimate, we'll do it anyways.

1172
01:59:31,467 --> 01:59:46,633
Larsen: I really think if we were focusing strictly on increasing ridership, we would actually, it would all be disparately impacted in favor of all the communities we're worried about just based on the way population is distributed in the area.

1173
01:59:47,114 --> 01:59:56,530
Larsen: And I would like for us to kind of move towards a paradigm of focusing much, much more on increasing ridership across the board.

1174
01:59:56,965 --> 02:00:02,020
Larsen: and less on finding possible reasons to not increase ridership.

1175
02:00:03,163 --> 02:00:04,146
Larsen: So I'll be in no vote.

1176
02:00:04,166 --> 02:00:05,089
Larsen: Thanks.

1177
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:05,951
Larsen: Thank you, Director Larson.

1178
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:06,874
=START-9=
SPEAKER_10: Secretary Nicholson.

1179
02:00:08,491 --> 02:00:17,099
Nicholson: So I sat through two committee meetings, a study session and a town hall all on this topic.

1180
02:00:17,479 --> 02:00:28,369
Nicholson: And I should say, expertly facilitated by our co-chairs and by our chair of finance and our staff.

1181
02:00:28,649 --> 02:00:34,294
Nicholson: And I feel like I just starting to get a decent understanding of it.

1182
02:00:34,494 --> 02:00:38,498
Nicholson: Like I came into this knowing nothing about this.

1183
02:00:38,478 --> 02:00:58,461
Nicholson: I was an absolute no when we first started and my public remarks, you know, made that very clear but I want to commend staff and our board leadership who were willing to indulge because I came to understand it.

1184
02:00:58,863 --> 02:01:10,864
Nicholson: I came to understand what it was for, I came to understand how it works, and I don't necessarily agree with all of it, and I think we could use more data in addition to those data we have now to determine this, but...

1185
02:01:11,992 --> 02:01:13,995
Nicholson: If we don't pass this, we lose federal funding.

1186
02:01:14,316 --> 02:01:16,479
Nicholson: So there's a good reason to pass it even if you don't like it.

1187
02:01:18,021 --> 02:01:22,789
Nicholson: But on top of that, I just think our staff did their jobs.

1188
02:01:23,290 --> 02:01:28,298
Nicholson: They have demonstrated to me this is the right thing to do despite my skepticism.

1189
02:01:28,518 --> 02:01:30,341
Nicholson: And so I'm definitely voting for it tonight.

1190
02:01:30,982 --> 02:01:31,723
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

1191
02:01:31,743 --> 02:01:33,105
SPEAKER_10: Any further comments on the main motion?

1192
02:01:34,503 --> 02:01:35,205
SPEAKER_10: Okay, seeing none.

1193
02:01:35,225 --> 02:01:38,011
SPEAKER_10: We had Catlin as the mover and Guzman as the second.

1194
02:01:38,532 --> 02:01:40,497
SPEAKER_10: There is indication that there will be no votes.

1195
02:01:40,557 --> 02:01:42,722
SPEAKER_10: So I will be doing a roll call vote on this.
=END-9=

SPEAKER_10: Secretary Nicholson.

1211
02:02:04,712 --> 02:02:04,992
SPEAKER_10: I'm in.

1212
02:02:06,294 --> 02:02:07,155
SPEAKER_10: First Vice Chair O'Keeffe.

1213
02:02:08,017 --> 02:02:08,257
Nicholson: Yes.

1214
02:02:08,657 --> 02:02:09,439
SPEAKER_10: Dr. Pagulari.

1215
02:02:11,041 --> 02:02:11,321
SPEAKER_10: Yes.

1216
02:02:11,962 --> 02:02:12,603
SPEAKER_10: Dr. Ruscha.

1217
02:02:12,924 --> 02:02:14,666

1218
02:02:14,747 --> 02:02:15,748
SPEAKER_10: Second Vice Chair Whitmore.

1219
02:02:15,982 --> 02:02:16,282
SPEAKER_10: Yes.

1220
02:02:17,043 --> 02:02:17,905
SPEAKER_10: I'm also, yes.

1221
02:02:18,345 --> 02:02:24,453
SPEAKER_10: So the motion, the main motion will pass 11, two and two absent.

1222
02:02:25,895 --> 02:02:26,095
SPEAKER_10: Yes.

1223
02:02:26,416 --> 02:02:28,258
SPEAKER_10: That math adds up.

1224
02:02:28,278 --> 02:02:28,559
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

1225
02:02:29,079 --> 02:02:39,773
SPEAKER_10: Moving on, we're going to be moving to our next recommended action, which is the budget transfer articulated buses supporting Colfax bus rapid transit or BRT service.

1226
02:02:39,873 --> 02:02:40,775
SPEAKER_10: Do I have a mover?

1227
02:02:41,736 --> 02:02:42,136
Guzman: So moved.

1228
02:02:42,176 --> 02:02:42,597
Guzman: Guzman.

1229
02:02:42,644 --> 02:02:43,726
SPEAKER_10: I have Guzman as the mover.

1230
02:02:43,746 --> 02:02:44,447
SPEAKER_10: Do I have a second?

1231
02:02:44,567 --> 02:02:44,848
SPEAKER_10: Second.

1232
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,711
Paglieri: Sir.

1233
02:02:47,071 --> 02:02:47,792
Paglieri: Yeah.

1234
02:02:47,812 --> 02:02:48,073
Paglieri: Oh, wait.

1235
02:02:48,473 --> 02:02:49,114
Paglieri: Well, I could be wrong.

1236
02:02:49,134 --> 02:02:49,455
Paglieri: I'm sorry.

1237
02:02:50,256 --> 02:02:51,238
Paglieri: I forgot we started late.

1238
02:02:51,498 --> 02:02:52,560
Paglieri: I thought we had our four hour mark.

1239
02:02:53,041 --> 02:02:53,562
Paglieri: Please ignore me.

1240
02:02:56,546 --> 02:02:57,087
SPEAKER_10: Oh, sorry.

1241
02:02:57,107 --> 02:02:58,870
SPEAKER_10: Guzman is the mover.

1242
02:02:58,930 --> 02:03:00,132
SPEAKER_10: Whitmore is the second.

1243
02:03:03,858 --> 02:03:04,900
SPEAKER_10: Any discussion on it?

1244
02:03:05,881 --> 02:03:06,863
SPEAKER_10: Yeah, director Pagular.

1245
02:03:07,231 --> 02:03:11,818
SPEAKER_03: I just wanted to say a few quick words about why I will not be voting for this.

1246
02:03:11,858 --> 02:03:24,438
SPEAKER_03: I was not necessarily sure how this would further the clean energy and zero emission goals of the state of Colorado.

1247
02:03:24,458 --> 02:03:29,025
SPEAKER_03: And therefore, we'll just be voting now.

1248
02:03:29,085 --> 02:03:29,425
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.

1249
02:03:31,949 --> 02:03:33,431
SPEAKER_03: Any further conversation?

1250
02:03:33,472 --> 02:03:34,453
=START-10=
SPEAKER_03: Secretary Nicholson?

1251
02:03:35,767 --> 02:03:39,856
Nicholson: Yeah, so I understand where we're the importance of what we're doing here.

1252
02:03:41,459 --> 02:03:50,839
Nicholson: I think that these buses in particular, you know, in my religion, there's a thing why is this night different from all other nights why are these buses different from all other buses.

1253
02:03:52,068 --> 02:03:56,232
Nicholson: These are going to be the flagship of our flagship BRT line.

1254
02:03:57,093 --> 02:04:03,740
Nicholson: And if these suck, it will kill BRT.

1255
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:18,555
Nicholson: And if they are not comfortable, if they are not just awesome in every way possible, you can make a lot of choices when you buy a bus about how nice it's going to be in the same way you can make a lot of choices about when you buy a car about how nice it's going to be.

1256
02:04:19,215 --> 02:04:22,058
Nicholson: And so I just want to lean in here

1257
02:04:22,038 --> 02:04:44,939
Nicholson: and I do have one question, to say that we need to pull the stops out, we need to make sure we're giving you enough money, GMCO Johnson, to make sure we're buying top of the line, to make sure that these are things that when they run through my district, people go, wow, I want to get on that, not, wow, that doesn't look very nice.

1258
02:04:45,659 --> 02:04:52,045
Nicholson: And so my question for you is, how do you know that the amount of money that we're authorizing today

1259
02:04:52,025 --> 02:04:54,128
Nicholson: is enough to get top of the line.

1260
02:04:54,909 --> 02:05:05,364
Nicholson: And how many bytes at the Apple are we going to get to make sure that you are buying the right buses for this incredibly important project?

1261
02:05:06,565 --> 02:05:06,746
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

1262
02:05:06,806 --> 02:05:09,490
SPEAKER_10: Johnson is 51 million enough to make them not suck.

1263
02:05:10,671 --> 02:05:11,232
SPEAKER_16: Yeah.
=END-10=

1264
02:05:12,308 --> 02:05:15,090
SPEAKER_16: So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

1265
02:05:15,731 --> 02:05:17,733
SPEAKER_16: And thank you for the question.

1266
02:05:18,433 --> 02:05:19,594
SPEAKER_09: My apologies.

1267
02:05:19,634 --> 02:05:20,355
SPEAKER_16: That was a good question.

1268
02:05:20,575 --> 02:05:21,336
SPEAKER_16: Keep it in mind.

1269
02:05:21,356 --> 02:05:25,660
SPEAKER_16: This is a budget transfer and full transparency.

1270
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:30,724
SPEAKER_16: Director Nicholson emailed me about this because I think there was some confusion about where we are.

1271
02:05:31,045 --> 02:05:32,626
SPEAKER_16: There is yet to be a solicitation.

1272
02:05:32,666 --> 02:05:34,488
SPEAKER_16: There's yet to be specifications.

1273
02:05:34,888 --> 02:05:41,674
SPEAKER_16: So these monies that are being transferred or needed

1274
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:44,399
SPEAKER_16: for all intents and purposes so we can start a procurement.

1275
02:05:46,841 --> 02:05:49,845
SPEAKER_16: Now, keeping in mind, there's a couple of elements.

1276
02:05:50,185 --> 02:05:58,355
SPEAKER_16: These buses have to be dedicated because this is designated as a bus rapid transit project as defined by the Federal Transit Administration.

1277
02:05:58,815 --> 02:06:04,402
SPEAKER_16: There's certain criteria that we have to ensure that we adhere to.

1278
02:06:04,462 --> 02:06:11,610
SPEAKER_16: This will be a dedicated fleet just by virtue of the configuration of BRT with it being a center running platform.

1279
02:06:12,097 --> 02:06:23,033
SPEAKER_16: So when you talk about it being top of the line, that's yet to be seen in reference to what we have before us because there's only two original equipment manufacturers in the United States.

1280
02:06:23,093 --> 02:06:24,635
SPEAKER_16: There's only so many suppliers.

1281
02:06:24,996 --> 02:06:33,548
SPEAKER_16: There are certain seeds and there is a national task force in which I sit where we're talking about doing away with customization because that increases prices.

1282
02:06:33,798 --> 02:06:37,842
SPEAKER_16: I bet you don't know how many shades of white there is with new flier industries.

1283
02:06:38,142 --> 02:06:38,323
SPEAKER_16: 24.

1284
02:06:38,623 --> 02:06:39,684
SPEAKER_16: How many?

1285
02:06:39,704 --> 02:06:40,285
SPEAKER_16: 24.

1286
02:06:40,305 --> 02:06:41,186
SPEAKER_16: 23.

1287
02:06:41,446 --> 02:06:42,927
SPEAKER_16: I think I told you that earlier.

1288
02:06:43,008 --> 02:06:53,118
SPEAKER_16: So the point of the matter is, as we talk about this, right, we're going to do our due diligence and we're going to ensure it's a competitive solicitation.

1289
02:06:53,158 --> 02:07:00,526
SPEAKER_16: And we do understand the aspects because that's what separates bus rapid transit from general thick route service.

1290
02:07:01,427 --> 02:07:01,847
SPEAKER_16: Thank you.

1291
02:07:02,485 --> 02:07:04,928
=START-11=
Nicholson: Secretary, I really appreciate it.

1292
02:07:05,008 --> 02:07:09,695
Nicholson: And I look forward to you coming back often to update us on how the purchase is going.

1293
02:07:12,098 --> 02:07:12,599
Whitmore: Yes.

1294
02:07:12,619 --> 02:07:23,594
Guzman: Uh, director Griswold, just really quickly, uh, with regards to this, moving this money from the unrestricted fund is simply to begin the procurement process.
=END-11=

1295
02:07:24,115 --> 02:07:27,900
Guzman: And although it's not part of the 2025 budget, we do need to get started on it.

1296
02:07:28,501 --> 02:07:29,202
Guzman: Um, however,

1297
02:07:29,452 --> 02:07:36,600
Guzman: I would suggest that as we go forward, these buses are meant to be purchased in finality by 2027 to begin this service.

1298
02:07:37,241 --> 02:07:48,754
Guzman: And that is work that we will do to fully do on finance and planning to ensure that it is included in all necessary documents that come before this board for approval.

1299
02:07:49,234 --> 02:07:52,458
Guzman: And I am certain that our new CFO is up to the task on that.

1300
02:07:52,578 --> 02:07:58,885
Guzman: So rest assured, directors, we're not wantonly spending money, but we do need to authorize

1301
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:21,987
SPEAKER_10: this for the procurement of the buses at this point thank you thank you director any further discussion on this item all right there is a note oh no sounds good all right i was it was indicated there will be a no vote so i'll do a roll call vote again this is the budget transfer articulate articulated buses supporting coal fax vrt service uh treasure banker

02:08:54,524 --> 02:08:55,745
SPEAKER_10: OK.

1332
02:08:55,765 --> 02:08:58,768

1333
02:08:59,668 --> 02:08:59,969
SPEAKER_10: All right.

1334

SPEAKER_10: Thank you, folks.

1335
02:09:00,709 --> 02:09:01,750
SPEAKER_10: So we have one.

1336
02:09:02,171 --> 02:09:03,472
Larsen: Chair Buke, could you remind us?

1337
02:09:03,772 --> 02:09:08,577
Larsen: Over here, we missed who the mover and the seconder were on that.

1338
02:09:08,957 --> 02:09:09,938
Larsen: I had Guzman and Whitmore.

1339
02:09:10,278 --> 02:09:10,459
Larsen: OK.

1340
02:09:10,539 --> 02:09:10,839
Larsen: Thank you.

1341
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:11,920
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

1342
02:09:12,743 --> 02:09:13,624
SPEAKER_10: Um, okay.

1343
02:09:13,644 --> 02:09:13,985
SPEAKER_10: Excellent.

1344
02:09:14,265 --> 02:09:15,787
SPEAKER_10: Uh, thank you all again for your patience.

1345
02:09:15,807 --> 02:09:21,734
SPEAKER_10: We do have one more item and that is the equitable transit oriented development policy amendment.

1346
02:09:23,096 --> 02:09:38,194
SPEAKER_10: So for the board of directors to approve the amendment to resolution number two series of 2021, which created the equal transit oriented development policy that permits and encourages the development of affordable housing on RTD real property in order to include guidelines for disposing

1347
02:09:38,461 --> 02:09:42,527
SPEAKER_10: of RTD real property, below fair market value or rent.

1348
02:09:42,887 --> 02:09:43,548
SPEAKER_10: Do we have a motion?

1349
02:09:43,749 --> 02:09:44,490
SPEAKER_10: So moved, Guzman.

1350
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:45,471
SPEAKER_10: Guzman's the mover.

1351
02:09:45,491 --> 02:09:46,092
SPEAKER_10: Do we have a second?

1352
02:09:46,613 --> 02:09:47,755
SPEAKER_10: I have Harwick as a second.

1353
02:09:49,697 --> 02:09:54,985
SPEAKER_10: I do understand that on this item, we have some proposed amendments from Director Nicholson and Director Ruscha.

1354
02:09:55,926 --> 02:09:59,772
SPEAKER_10: Since Director Nicholson's amendment was circulated to the board first, we will start there.

1355
02:10:00,393 --> 02:10:03,237
=START-13=
SPEAKER_10: Director Nicholson, please now make your motion to amend.

1356
02:10:03,824 --> 02:10:17,993
Nicholson: Yes, I'd like to move to amend the etod policy and I'm hoping that GMC GMC that Mr. Crawl can put up those that language on the screen.

1357
02:10:18,954 --> 02:10:19,395
Nicholson: It's there.

1358
02:10:20,037 --> 02:10:20,217
SPEAKER_10: Right.

1359
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:22,221
Nicholson: May I.

1360
02:10:23,618 --> 02:10:26,363
SPEAKER_10: Uh, would you like to read the motion and then we'll get a second.

1361
02:10:26,524 --> 02:10:26,884
Nicholson: Thank you.

1362
02:10:26,924 --> 02:10:27,445
Nicholson: Yeah.

1363
02:10:27,466 --> 02:10:41,593
Nicholson: So, uh, move to amend the policy, uh, such that section five of the equitable transit oriented development policy regarding negotiated land price be updated as follows to raise the maximum negotiated land price discount to 75% from 50%.

1364
02:10:41,573 --> 02:10:59,970
Nicholson: and add the following additional factors to favorably consider projects which include more accessible units than required by law, limit residential parking, are deeply affordable, emphasize priority groups as identified by the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority,

1365
02:11:00,085 --> 02:11:10,429
Nicholson: and incorporate smaller footprint retail, including below market rate units, below market rate retail, excuse me, that prioritizes local businesses and entrepreneurs.

1366
02:11:13,236 --> 02:11:15,461
SPEAKER_10: Excellent.

1367
02:11:15,481 --> 02:11:16,403
SPEAKER_10: And do we have a second on that?

1368
02:11:16,985 --> 02:11:17,606
Nicholson: Second.

1369
02:11:17,626 --> 02:11:18,448
SPEAKER_10: Hardwick is the second.

1370
02:11:20,521 --> 02:11:22,165
Nicholson: Secretary, would you like to discuss further?

1371
02:11:22,425 --> 02:11:22,786
Nicholson: Thank you.

1372
02:11:22,806 --> 02:11:23,027
Nicholson: Yes.

1373
02:11:23,367 --> 02:11:35,695
Nicholson: Before I get into my remarks, I'd like to ask Executive Manager Kroll to briefly describe the five pieces of written public comment that we received on this recommended action from some of our local public officials.

1374
02:11:36,232 --> 02:11:44,392
Larsen: Yes, so four of the written public common items were submitted by individuals specifically supportive of the change director Nicholson is offering.

1375
02:11:44,412 --> 02:11:54,055
Larsen: And those four individuals were the mayor of Boulder, a city council member from Boulder, a city council member from Westminster and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.

1376
02:11:54,035 --> 02:12:08,098
Larsen: And then the fifth letter was submitted by SWEAP in joint with Conservation Colorado and Denver Streets Partnership, which spoke more broadly to the overall changes being offered this evening.

1377
02:12:10,943 --> 02:12:11,564
Larsen: Perfect, Secretary.

1378
02:12:12,045 --> 02:12:13,347
Nicholson: Thank you.

1379
02:12:13,367 --> 02:12:15,891
Nicholson: And thank you, Executive Manager Crawl.

1380
02:12:16,630 --> 02:12:19,394
Nicholson: So here at RTD, we make lives better through connections.

1381
02:12:19,755 --> 02:12:23,381
Nicholson: Tonight as a board, we have an opportunity to do that in a particularly powerful way.

1382
02:12:24,242 --> 02:12:26,125
Nicholson: Our rider surveys tell a clear story.

1383
02:12:26,666 --> 02:12:33,277
Nicholson: Over half our passengers live below 200% of the federal poverty level, and they are far less likely to own a car.

1384
02:12:34,018 --> 02:12:40,849
Nicholson: Our riders with disabilities use RTD at disproportionately high rates, as do other vulnerable populations in our community.

1385
02:12:40,829 --> 02:12:47,738
Nicholson: Yet only a fraction of affordable housing developed near our stations truly meets the needs of our most dedicated riders.

1386
02:12:48,419 --> 02:12:52,405
Nicholson: Communities in our state have struggled to create housing targeted at our ridership.

1387
02:12:52,785 --> 02:12:59,134
Nicholson: Inclusionary zoning has mostly led to housing at 60% AMI, about $51,000 a year in earnings.

1388
02:12:59,694 --> 02:13:08,406
Nicholson: This housing is necessary but priced well out of reach for someone making only $31,000, which is 200% of the federal poverty line.

1389
02:13:08,386 --> 02:13:17,766
Nicholson: This amendment empowers RTD to deepen our land discount offerings, up to 75%, to incentivize projects specifically tailored to the actual economic realities of our riders.

1390
02:13:18,428 --> 02:13:20,151
Nicholson: Here's how that can work in practice.

1391
02:13:20,171 --> 02:13:27,407
Nicholson: Just this month, Denver Health donated the land to create Tapestry, a deeply affordable, accessible, transit-oriented housing project.

1392
02:13:27,775 --> 02:13:36,789
Nicholson: It supports a range of affordability from 30% to 80%, as well as far more three-bedroom and even four-bedroom units than most affordable projects being built today.

1393
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:44,842
Nicholson: It targets accessibility because distance to transit is a major barrier for people with disabilities to use transit.

1394
02:13:44,862 --> 02:13:52,213
Nicholson: This holds for all types of disabilities and unfortunately, painfully few Class A fully accessible units exist

1395
02:13:52,193 --> 02:13:53,715
Nicholson: in the RTD service area.

1396
02:13:54,255 --> 02:13:58,579
Nicholson: By creating greater incentives for developers, we can do a lot to play our part in fixing that.

1397
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:05,767
Nicholson: It's late, so I won't go through the argument for reduced parking and the service of CHFA's priority populations.

1398
02:14:06,047 --> 02:14:07,649
Nicholson: You all have an email from me with that data.

1399
02:14:08,169 --> 02:14:14,616
Nicholson: But I do want Director Harwick to speak after me to address the language he added on smaller footprint and below market retail.

1400
02:14:15,437 --> 02:14:21,863
Nicholson: Community is about more than housing, and I enthusiastically added his language for the reasons he'll highlight.

1401
02:14:22,113 --> 02:14:26,820
Nicholson: This framework recognizes that we are not the housing policy experts.

1402
02:14:27,341 --> 02:14:46,290
Nicholson: It increases the scope of our tools and trusts our staff to use them effectively to bring us thoughtful projects, projects that align with our strategic priority of community value and enable us to grow ridership by putting the people who most need transit where they can best be served by it.

1403
02:14:46,831 --> 02:14:48,233
Nicholson: I ask your support for this amendment.

1404
02:14:48,754 --> 02:14:48,954
Larsen: Thank you.

1405
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:50,196
Nicholson: Dr. Harbert.

1406
02:14:51,661 --> 02:15:08,050
Harwick: Yeah, so I wanted to make sure that when we're talking about TOD that we're really thinking also about mixed use TOD and I'm wildly in favor of Anything that we can do to bring more housing let alone affordable housing to

1407
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:09,191
Harwick: to our park and rides.

1408
02:15:09,211 --> 02:15:20,846
Harwick: I do think it's really key that we also think about what are the businesses that we are bringing in there and, you know, having spent a lot of time working at Starbucks and a good friend of mine works at Starbucks.

1409
02:15:20,866 --> 02:15:29,717
Harwick: You know, I'm also really in favor of coffee shops like Prodigy and smaller shops, but also thinking about when I've traveled to other
=END-13=

1410
02:15:29,697 --> 02:15:52,144
Harwick: Communities throughout the world there oftentimes are smaller retail shops that give Young entrepreneurs that opportunity to start a business and not be burdened by a larger footprint that Some of our larger restaurants or larger retail shops can they can cover those those costs so you know this this to me was a way to encourage local businesses to

1411
02:15:52,124 --> 02:16:07,852
Harwick: start up or expand and, you know, give them the opportunity in a place that we all, you know, we all, when we go to a parking ride and there's not something there to grab that quick bite to eat, I want to give them that opportunity, everyone that opportunity, one to shop there and sell there.

1412
02:16:09,415 --> 02:16:12,260
SPEAKER_10: Director Harwick, any further discussion on this amendment?

1413
02:16:13,362 --> 02:16:13,963
SPEAKER_10: Director Usha.

1414
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:16,513
Paglieri: Uh, Mr. Chair, maybe you can help me here.

1415
02:16:16,613 --> 02:16:21,940
Paglieri: So I had a comment slash, but I had a comment on the main motion, but we moved to amendments.

1416
02:16:22,361 --> 02:16:28,269
Paglieri: But like recognizing that Secretary Nicholson's language can't exist without the motion language of the way it's drafted.

1417
02:16:28,489 --> 02:16:30,432
Paglieri: May I just make a general comment?

1418
02:16:30,452 --> 02:16:31,373
Paglieri: Does that sort of make sense?

1419
02:16:31,533 --> 02:16:36,560
Paglieri: It would apply to both, but I don't know if I would be called out of order and I'm tired of what you say.

1420
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:37,201
SPEAKER_10: So you know what?

1421
02:16:37,221 --> 02:16:37,641
SPEAKER_10: Why not?

1422
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:38,783
SPEAKER_10: Let's give it a try.

1423
02:16:38,863 --> 02:16:39,664
Paglieri: Thanks.

1424
02:16:39,644 --> 02:16:40,305
Paglieri: I'm doing my best.

1425
02:16:40,826 --> 02:16:52,644
Paglieri: Okay, so this morning we got an email from staff that addressed some outstanding questions that I still had, just so I knew what I was voting on.

1426
02:16:53,205 --> 02:17:06,225
Paglieri: And I have a heartburn over just the main motion because the way it's written, we as a board,

1427
02:17:06,475 --> 02:17:20,030
Paglieri: are not just expanding the bounds of what a policy is, we're also signing away like 30 plus years of precedent of having this guardrail that says, before you go dispense of real property, get our preliminary authorization.

1428
02:17:20,651 --> 02:17:28,600
Paglieri: So I guess like I've, so I am already a little bit uncomfortable.

1429
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,723
Paglieri: And also the policy says that if

1430
02:17:32,092 --> 02:17:38,579
Paglieri: A developer, as it relates to housing, cannot meet our 50% standard.

1431
02:17:39,039 --> 02:17:44,105
Paglieri: They could still get a major discount, and it could be millions and millions of dollars.

1432
02:17:44,645 --> 02:17:51,312
Paglieri: And so those two combined, and just recognizing that these deals take a long, long time, they're not suburb projects.

1433
02:17:52,794 --> 02:18:01,643
Paglieri: In sum, it means that all of that is going to happen, and then it's going to come back to the board when all of those decisions have been made.

1434
02:18:01,859 --> 02:18:21,235
Paglieri: and that and so it's for that because I'm struggling with the original proposal but I can accept it for now is why I can't vote yes on Secretary Nicholson's amendment because it doesn't because we don't have guardrails that I would prefer so I

1435
02:18:21,603 --> 02:18:25,688
Paglieri: I hope that was not out of order and if it was, thanks for not calling me out of order.

1436
02:18:25,708 --> 02:18:26,069
Guissinger: Thank you.

1437
02:18:26,409 --> 02:18:27,130
Guzman: Are you director chef?

1438
02:18:27,471 --> 02:18:28,032
Guzman: Director Guzmore.

1439
02:18:28,873 --> 02:18:35,642
Guzman: So, ETOD has been discussed a number of times in the committee and this is my concern.

1440
02:18:38,446 --> 02:18:44,033
Guzman: Although I am with you in spirit, deeply affordable housing is really important.

1441
02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:53,892
Guzman: I'm not sure that giving an additional 25% discount in our policy is wise for a number of reasons.

1442
02:18:54,233 --> 02:18:58,679
Guzman: I do believe, however, and maybe Madam CEO or Ms.

1443
02:18:58,719 --> 02:19:01,403
Guzman: Chessie Brady might be able to speak to this, I'm not sure.

1444
02:19:03,206 --> 02:19:10,476
Guzman: What we were asked for in this policy was to give guidelines to begin negotiation that would eventually come back to this board.

1445
02:19:11,688 --> 02:19:23,853
Guzman: Let's say a developer comes to us and just brings us an amazing proposal that includes everything that you could want in a development and more.

1446
02:19:23,873 --> 02:19:29,605
Guzman: I don't see why they wouldn't necessarily come back to us and say, hey, they're willing to do all of these things.

1447
02:19:29,985 --> 02:19:30,827
Guzman: They being staff.

1448
02:19:31,145 --> 02:19:45,639
Guzman: and asking for an additional amount of up to whatever amount makes sense to give that discount from the board that we would consider properly and then be able to authorize in that moment.

1449
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:52,866
Guzman: But in order to begin the process, we were simply asked to give authorization for them to work within a parameter.

1450
02:19:52,926 --> 02:19:59,272
Guzman: That way there was no confusion that they would be able to do a 30 to 50% discount as was written in the original policy.

1451
02:19:59,772 --> 02:20:00,713
Guzman: Beyond that,

1452
02:20:01,385 --> 02:20:08,376
Guzman: the board would still have authority, as I understand it, if we were asked to offer an additional discount for more.

1453
02:20:09,037 --> 02:20:26,785
Guzman: I don't know that we need to lock that into policy, and it does the one thing that I was trained by former directors and members that are currently here not to do, which is bind future boards in a way that creates difficulty for us to do our job as the fiduciaries of the agency.

1454
02:20:26,945 --> 02:20:28,928
Guzman: And so I would like to ask that question

1455
02:20:29,431 --> 02:20:42,383
Guzman: Is there anything that would prevent you from coming back to us if we were to receive such an excellent proposal that prevents you from saying, can we receive an additional discount to offer a developer board?

1456
02:20:43,125 --> 02:20:45,330
Guzman: And would you approve this so we can make a project work?

1457
02:20:47,116 --> 02:20:47,296
SPEAKER_10: Ms.

1458
02:20:47,316 --> 02:20:49,059
SPEAKER_10: Brady, first off, thank you for your patience.

1459
02:20:49,079 --> 02:20:51,122
SPEAKER_10: I greatly appreciate you sticking around tonight.

1460
02:20:51,162 --> 02:20:51,602
Brady: Of course.

1461
02:20:51,923 --> 02:20:53,204
SPEAKER_10: You're recognized.

1462
02:20:53,525 --> 02:20:53,865
Brady: Thank you.

1463
02:20:54,526 --> 02:20:57,450
Brady: No, there is nothing that would stop us from doing that.

1464
02:20:57,931 --> 02:21:03,639
Brady: As you say, the point of the policy is to create guardrails and certainty within those guardrails.

1465
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:13,652
Brady: We would use the opinions of the board to guide developers towards what we think the board would be interested in as we're negotiating with them.

1466
02:21:13,753 --> 02:21:14,794
Brady: And we would come back to the board

1467
02:21:15,112 --> 02:21:17,235
Brady: for approval of any given project.

1468
02:21:18,056 --> 02:21:18,417
Guzman: Thank you.

1469
02:21:19,218 --> 02:21:31,356
Guzman: One more quick thing and Director Banker, Treasurer Banker, the sales and the lease income from our real estate properties are put into a specific account.

1470
02:21:31,456 --> 02:21:32,398
Guzman: Can you guess which one?

1471
02:21:33,139 --> 02:21:44,916
Guzman: Because when we deeply discount things beyond where we should, we are saying no to the potential income that we could use for operations and maintenance and service provision

1472
02:21:45,554 --> 02:21:46,636
Guzman: elsewhere in the agency.

1473
02:21:47,296 --> 02:21:54,907
Guzman: So on balance, real estate and real property are a finite resource, and dollars can be stretched thin.

1474
02:21:55,668 --> 02:22:06,324
Guzman: But how we use the opportunity to either receive money to prolong and serve the public further is a huge consideration in this.

1475
02:22:06,564 --> 02:22:11,191
Guzman: So although I am with you in spirit, I would be voting no on the amendment as it is right now.

1476
02:22:11,872 --> 02:22:12,492
Guzman: Thank you, Director.

1477
02:22:13,434 --> 02:22:14,295
SPEAKER_03: Director Pagulieri.

1478
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:16,292
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, I'll be brief.

1479
02:22:16,712 --> 02:22:21,438
SPEAKER_03: I really like the language that highlights these things that I deeply agree with.

1480
02:22:22,219 --> 02:22:23,801
SPEAKER_03: I am a little bit concerned about two things.

1481
02:22:23,841 --> 02:22:26,544
SPEAKER_03: The first is the language deeply affordable.

1482
02:22:26,564 --> 02:22:31,309
SPEAKER_03: It's a little bit ambiguous, if I'm saying that right.

1483
02:22:32,291 --> 02:22:42,983
SPEAKER_03: And I think using language like that can, like, what's to say, they discounted $100 to some, that's a deep discount to others, that's nothing.

1484
02:22:42,963 --> 02:22:50,914
SPEAKER_03: So I'd recommend removing that word and just maybe also deeply affordable unless you can divine it elsewhere.

1485
02:22:51,435 --> 02:22:53,638
SPEAKER_03: But I do want to leave this language.

1486
02:22:53,658 --> 02:23:01,950
SPEAKER_03: And the other thing is I just have a hard time giving a 75% discount even with these things that I want.

1487
02:23:01,930 --> 02:23:18,726
SPEAKER_03: And perhaps that this is a really limited circumstance that we'd give 75%, but this is our property and I really would like to see it sold for the highest value to benefit all.

1488
02:23:18,947 --> 02:23:19,287
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.

1489
02:23:19,788 --> 02:23:21,913
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Director.

1490
02:23:22,889 --> 02:23:25,332
Benker: Just a quick question.

1491
02:23:25,892 --> 02:23:33,261
Benker: Some of these surplus properties that we're talking about, we are not including our current park and rides, correct?

1492
02:23:34,282 --> 02:23:40,489
Benker: Would be excess land, perhaps around a park and ride, but not one of our park and rides.

1493
02:23:42,011 --> 02:23:42,992
Benker: Just clarification.

1494
02:23:43,733 --> 02:23:44,214
Brady: Thank you.

1495
02:23:44,234 --> 02:23:48,158
Brady: So this policy is aimed at transoriented development.

1496
02:23:48,619 --> 02:23:50,601
Brady: So property that RTD owns

1497
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:53,784
Brady: at transit stations or near high frequency transit.

1498
02:23:54,404 --> 02:24:07,240
Brady: Access property and surplus property are definable terms that perhaps Michelle could help us with, but those are distinctive properties that the board has named to be excess and surplus.

1499
02:24:07,661 --> 02:24:10,384
Brady: And so I just want to separate that from a park and ride.

1500
02:24:10,424 --> 02:24:12,407
Brady: A park and ride is certainly not excess or surplus.

1501
02:24:13,268 --> 02:24:15,531
Brady: It may have underutilized land.

1502
02:24:15,691 --> 02:24:19,896
Brady: It may have a large drainage area that is part of the park and ride.

1503
02:24:20,551 --> 02:24:29,414
Brady: But not every development that we would consider on a park and ride would remove parking if that's getting more to your question.

1504
02:24:30,216 --> 02:24:30,938
Brady: Okay, yes.

1505
02:24:33,425 --> 02:24:34,307
=START-14=
SPEAKER_10: Secretary Nicholson.

1506
02:24:35,435 --> 02:24:38,138
Nicholson: I actually have some questions for Ms.

1507
02:24:38,659 --> 02:24:38,979
Nicholson: Brady.

1508
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:44,386
Nicholson: So first off, Director Pagliari raised the concern about the term deep affordability.

1509
02:24:45,006 --> 02:24:49,612
Nicholson: I think you and I know what that means, but maybe the rest of the board doesn't, given it's a term of art.

1510
02:24:49,672 --> 02:24:53,356
Nicholson: Can you elaborate on what that's referring to?

1511
02:24:54,097 --> 02:24:54,258
Nicholson: Ms.

1512
02:24:54,298 --> 02:24:54,538
Nicholson: Brady.

1513
02:24:54,978 --> 02:24:55,279
Brady: Sure.

1514
02:24:55,339 --> 02:24:55,519
Brady: Yes.

1515
02:24:55,819 --> 02:25:03,889
Brady: Deep affordability is a term in the affordable housing network that means generally 30 to 40% of AMI.

1516
02:25:04,308 --> 02:25:09,427
Brady: It is squishy, I think still, but generally it's understood to mean 30 to 40%.

1517
02:25:09,487 --> 02:25:11,635
Nicholson: Secretary.

1518
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:19,360
Nicholson: So second question, I've heard a couple of concerns about 75% as a discount.

1519
02:25:21,042 --> 02:25:34,541
Nicholson: I was hoping maybe you could speak to like, because I mentioned it a little bit, but as someone who's an expert in the space, and I will say you and I worked pretty closely together on this language and went back and forth, you did a meeting with me.

1520
02:25:34,621 --> 02:25:37,024
Nicholson: So this isn't just something that I wrote myself.

1521
02:25:37,104 --> 02:25:41,470
Nicholson: This is something that got vetted pretty heavily by staff.

1522
02:25:42,395 --> 02:25:58,017
Nicholson: What impact does a greater discount have on the types of projects that in the affordable housing space you tend to see people able to build?

1523
02:25:58,077 --> 02:26:02,243
Nicholson: At least from where I sit, the reason for doing this is that

1524
02:26:02,223 --> 02:26:11,859
Nicholson: When it comes to those deeply affordable, which are deeply subsidized units, when it comes to things like units that are fully accessible, those are expensive.

1525
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:18,551
Nicholson: They cost developers money, which is why when you don't have those subsidies, those units don't get built.

1526
02:26:18,611 --> 02:26:22,257
Nicholson: I think it's about half the projects that are in the CHFA database.

1527
02:26:22,237 --> 02:26:30,490
Nicholson: have zero units at 30% AMI and very few of them have anything with regard to accessibility.

1528
02:26:30,510 --> 02:26:36,559
Nicholson: So I'm hoping you can maybe elaborate on, you know, you're the one who would be using this tool at the end of the day.

1529
02:26:36,599 --> 02:26:41,246
Nicholson: How do you see it coming in handy with regard to what you're able to do?

1530
02:26:41,867 --> 02:26:43,330
Nicholson: And then I've won the last follow up.

1531
02:26:45,152 --> 02:26:45,493
SPEAKER_09: It's pretty.

1532
02:26:49,159 --> 02:26:49,459
Nicholson: You're not.

1533
02:26:53,185 --> 02:27:00,073
Brady: Thank you.

1534
02:27:00,793 --> 02:27:04,778
Brady: So affordable housing projects aren't notoriously difficult to finance.

1535
02:27:05,479 --> 02:27:16,130
Brady: And I mean, I think if you use the example earlier of tapestry and Denver health, Denver health, as you stated is correct donated the land for tapestry.

1536
02:27:16,170 --> 02:27:20,235
Brady: I can assure you that that development was still very difficult to finance.

1537
02:27:21,076 --> 02:27:21,336
Brady: So
=END-14=

1538
02:27:21,569 --> 02:27:31,042
Brady: even if the land we were giving the land at 100% discount, the projects would still not pencil in many cases.

1539
02:27:31,563 --> 02:27:49,888
Brady: And so our ability to discount the land to 75% as the board prefers just in many cases could get us over the hump from a project not being built to a project being built and to that project having more affordable units as opposed to

1540
02:27:50,105 --> 02:27:53,649
Brady: a higher, more of a middle income range.

1541
02:27:54,309 --> 02:27:56,752
Brady: And that's the difference that the land discount makes.

1542
02:27:57,112 --> 02:28:07,704
Brady: And that's the certainty that this policy helps me bring to conversations with developers is, gets them in the mindset of we're going to get some help here from RTD.

1543
02:28:08,484 --> 02:28:11,107
Brady: We can focus on deeper affordability units.

1544
02:28:11,127 --> 02:28:18,475
Brady: We can make bigger promises to Chaffa or other financing entities to host in Denver.

1545
02:28:18,877 --> 02:28:20,839
Brady: It helps us keep the projects moving.

1546
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:29,047
Brady: Um, but, and I'd be frank with you, this is, as I said, tapestry, even with a hundred percent discount, it's still hard to do.

1547
02:28:29,227 --> 02:28:30,569
Brady: This is not a silver bullet.

1548
02:28:31,169 --> 02:28:37,135
Brady: Um, but it, it moves the needle and it helps us actually, you know, keep projects afloat and get to the finish line.

1549
02:28:37,555 --> 02:28:37,996
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Ms.

1550
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:38,356
SPEAKER_10: Brady.

1551
02:28:38,597 --> 02:28:41,960
SPEAKER_10: We're going to wrap up with director O'Keith and then director Larson.

1552
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:44,142
=START-15=
Nicholson: Oh, I thought I got last word.

1553
02:28:44,847 --> 02:28:47,854
Nicholson: So, I support this amendment.

1554
02:28:47,994 --> 02:28:59,161
Nicholson: I think it is a reasonable step toward developing communities that are very likely to use our services.

1555
02:28:59,301 --> 02:29:03,531
Nicholson: And I think increasing ridership is something

1556
02:29:03,511 --> 02:29:04,613
Nicholson: we all agree on.

1557
02:29:04,653 --> 02:29:06,916
Nicholson: This is a concrete way to do that.

1558
02:29:08,018 --> 02:29:18,052
Nicholson: It also takes land not just for our benefit in ridership, but also puts improvements on it that helps the tax base.

1559
02:29:18,473 --> 02:29:32,353
Nicholson: And I think the communities that we serve would rather see a housing project end up on that property where it becomes improved.

1560
02:29:32,333 --> 02:29:33,815
Nicholson: versus somewhere else.

1561
02:29:33,835 --> 02:29:35,136
Nicholson: We're not the only game in town.

1562
02:29:35,176 --> 02:29:36,778
Nicholson: There's a lot of discounts out there.

1563
02:29:37,518 --> 02:29:43,505
Nicholson: And so we're not necessarily in a tight buyers market.

1564
02:29:43,645 --> 02:29:45,907
Nicholson: There's a lot of projects that can go forward.

1565
02:29:46,588 --> 02:29:54,797
Nicholson: And I think we need to put our best deal, at least give Chessie and the rest of the team the tools to bring the deal forward.

1566
02:29:55,758 --> 02:29:57,279
Nicholson: I do want to put one plug in.

1567
02:29:57,319 --> 02:29:58,180
Nicholson: We talked about it.

1568
02:29:58,481 --> 02:30:00,703
Nicholson: I don't think round leases

1569
02:30:00,683 --> 02:30:03,386
Nicholson: are the best tool in Colorado.

1570
02:30:03,426 --> 02:30:06,791
Nicholson: First of all, it's not as common as other places in the world.

1571
02:30:07,431 --> 02:30:15,642
Nicholson: And the other thing is toward the end of your ground lease, no matter how long you make it, the property will fall into disrepair.

1572
02:30:15,942 --> 02:30:21,409
Nicholson: They are not going to put money into physical facilities that are going to roll off their books.

1573
02:30:21,389 --> 02:30:29,080
Nicholson: So, for that reason, I like the discount is great and I love a sale versus a ground lease.

1574
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:31,383
Nicholson: And I know you'll keep that in mind as we go forward.

1575
02:30:32,084 --> 02:30:39,876
Nicholson: And anyway, that's another argument in favor of that tactic.

1576
02:30:39,896 --> 02:30:40,456
Larsen: Director Bill Arson.

1577
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:42,860
Larsen: Thank you.

1578
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:46,485
Larsen: I'm going to be a no vote on this.

1579
02:30:46,938 --> 02:30:50,763
Larsen: I don't agree with our transit oriented development policy as it is right now.

1580
02:30:50,983 --> 02:30:57,752
Larsen: I don't agree with the goal of trying to provide affordable housing or encourage it, incentivize it.

1581
02:30:58,132 --> 02:31:02,198
Larsen: I think we should be focused on trying to increase ridership.

1582
02:31:02,218 --> 02:31:11,950
Larsen: If we want to provide discounts on our land, we should provide them with the goal in mind of increasing the number of people that can live

1583
02:31:12,335 --> 02:31:17,220
Larsen: on the property, whatever is developed, and the amount of traffic that is on the property.
=END-15=

1584
02:31:18,381 --> 02:31:20,823
Larsen: So I'm a no on this.

1585
02:31:21,504 --> 02:31:22,404
Larsen: Thank you, Director Larson.

1586
02:31:22,545 --> 02:31:22,845
SPEAKER_10: All right.

1587
02:31:23,265 --> 02:31:25,247
SPEAKER_10: The indication there is a no vote.

1588
02:31:25,587 --> 02:31:27,109
SPEAKER_10: I am going to do a roll call vote.

1589
02:31:27,189 --> 02:31:30,332
SPEAKER_10: As a reminder, we are voting on Director Nicholson's amendment.

1617
02:32:26,253 --> 02:32:32,663
SPEAKER_10: Okay, moving on, we are gonna do our second amendment, which was brought forward by Director Ruscha.

1618
02:32:34,128 --> 02:32:37,552
SPEAKER_10: And Director Ruscha, would you like to introduce the language of the amendment?

1619
02:32:39,454 --> 02:32:42,358
Paglieri: It's being brought forth by Directors Ruscha and Guzman.

1620
02:32:43,038 --> 02:32:50,067
Paglieri: And I think he has the language in front of him.

1621
02:32:50,087 --> 02:32:51,208
Guzman: Director Guzman.

1622
02:32:51,228 --> 02:32:52,209
Guzman: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1623
02:32:52,249 --> 02:33:03,342
Guzman: We would like to make a motion to add the language to the end of this policy that says, additionally, no project will be eligible for any discounts unless it complies with the greater of the following.

1624
02:33:04,148 --> 02:33:15,530
Guzman: 5% of all units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities and an additional 2% of all units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities or to current U.S.

1625
02:33:15,550 --> 02:33:18,616
Guzman: Department of Housing, Urban Development Accessibility requirements.

1626
02:33:20,921 --> 02:33:21,702
SPEAKER_10: Do you have a second?

1627
02:33:22,745 --> 02:33:23,766
Larsen: We have Russia's second.

1628
02:33:24,828 --> 02:33:25,910
Larsen: Uh, Mr. Crow.

1629
02:33:25,930 --> 02:33:26,270
Larsen: I'm sorry.

1630
02:33:26,631 --> 02:33:38,207
Larsen: Just to clarify, Director Guzman, as I understood you reading that into the record, the highlighted portion above would be deleted and is not included in your motion.

1631
02:33:38,267 --> 02:33:38,648
Larsen: Correct?

1632
02:33:38,748 --> 02:33:39,089
Larsen: Correct.

1633
02:33:41,973 --> 02:33:42,133
SPEAKER_10: Correct.

1634
02:33:42,153 --> 02:33:45,879
SPEAKER_10: So the language we see, this would substitute the language.

1635
02:33:46,419 --> 02:33:46,720
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

1636
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:47,180
SPEAKER_10: Perfect.

1637
02:33:47,601 --> 02:33:51,907
Guzman: Simplifying it to the bare minimum to get this done.

1638
02:33:51,927 --> 02:33:52,448
Guzman: Director Russia.

1639
02:33:53,913 --> 02:33:58,800
Paglieri: I was happy to speak to motion, but I wasn't sure if we were, I'm tired.

1640
02:33:59,100 --> 02:33:59,461
Paglieri: Is that okay?

1641
02:34:00,502 --> 02:34:00,602
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

1642
02:34:00,622 --> 02:34:04,728
SPEAKER_10: I got Guzman as the mover and Risha as the second and we're up for a conversation.

1643
02:34:04,808 --> 02:34:04,989
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

1644
02:34:05,009 --> 02:34:05,730
SPEAKER_10: You're up, Dr. Risha.

1645
02:34:06,090 --> 02:34:06,511
Paglieri: Thank you, sir.

1646
02:34:06,551 --> 02:34:06,831
Paglieri: Okay.

1647
02:34:06,851 --> 02:34:23,194
Paglieri: So just for everyone's identification, we struck the first sentence, it was a two sentence amendment, just recognizing that we didn't have full staff concurrence on the first sentence, which would have applied this accessibility minimum to market rate housing.

1648
02:34:23,174 --> 02:34:28,001
Paglieri: And sometimes you shoot for the stars and land on the moon.

1649
02:34:29,003 --> 02:34:36,434
Paglieri: The second sentence, which just applies the HUD requirement to affordable housing, we did get staff concurrence.

1650
02:34:36,454 --> 02:34:38,978
Paglieri: So that's just the, that was the context behind that.

1651
02:34:40,741 --> 02:34:42,263
Paglieri: I sent out like a

1652
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:50,701
Paglieri: I kind of frequently ask questions in anticipation of some questions, so I'm happy to entertain any or we can address them.

1653
02:34:51,202 --> 02:35:12,553
Paglieri: I will say that we worked for three weeks and some change on this with housing advocates and folks who had worked in the space and people who had worked at CHAFA and at the state level on similar policy and advocacy organizations and then staff and legal.

1654
02:35:12,955 --> 02:35:22,209
Paglieri: So, I mean, just, I'm sorry, I am tired, too.

1655
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:34,407
Paglieri: In case anybody has any questions about what this is, I think just simplify it and say that HUD has a

1656
02:35:34,673 --> 02:35:38,438
Paglieri: current minimum accessibility requirement for funding, right?

1657
02:35:38,538 --> 02:35:47,108
Paglieri: And it's 5% of units are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, additional 2% of units are accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities.

1658
02:35:47,909 --> 02:35:55,538
Paglieri: And so a lot of times in these projects, that HUD requirement is going to kick in, but not all projects are going to have HUD dollars.

1659
02:35:56,139 --> 02:36:01,305
Paglieri: So just recognizing that a lot of jurisdictions take that HUD standard, which is

1660
02:36:01,522 --> 02:36:06,267
Paglieri: I maybe miss Brady can correct me, but I think it's 20 plus years old, 30 plus years old now.

1661
02:36:06,868 --> 02:36:11,913
Paglieri: Um, and they also incorporate that into their policies or their code or statute.

1662
02:36:12,193 --> 02:36:15,016
Paglieri: We did the same kind of good for goose, good for gander.

1663
02:36:15,797 --> 02:36:18,059
Paglieri: Um, I will stop there.

1664
02:36:18,079 --> 02:36:27,529
SPEAKER_10: Uh, unless anyone else has further questions or, or comment questions or comments on this amendment, uh, Dr. Catlin and then secretary Nicholson.

1665
02:36:28,910 --> 02:36:44,835
Catlin: I appreciate the thought going into this, but I believe that the First Amendment that we passed does give a lot of latitude towards Chessie and her staff to negotiate.

1666
02:36:45,556 --> 02:36:53,989
Catlin: And I fear that this one might be a little bit too regulatory and prescriptive.

1667
02:36:55,707 --> 02:37:05,740
Catlin: If that's the HUD requirement and somebody is applying for a HUD grant, then this would be taken care of automatically.

1668
02:37:06,341 --> 02:37:15,453
Catlin: So right now I'm willing to listen to other discussions, but I fear that it would not give Ms.

1669
02:37:15,493 --> 02:37:22,643
Catlin: Brady and her staff the maximum flexibility to look at the comprehensive merits of a proposal.

1670
02:37:25,441 --> 02:37:27,002
SPEAKER_10: Um, yeah, Ms.

1671
02:37:27,022 --> 02:37:28,444
Brady: Spriby.

1672
02:37:28,464 --> 02:37:28,664
Brady: Yeah.

1673
02:37:28,824 --> 02:37:41,496
Brady: So this is a bare minimum requirement that Denver already requires, for example, and the Colorado Department of Housing is already considering a higher threshold of requirement.

1674
02:37:41,576 --> 02:37:44,378
Brady: So I have, I have no concerns about incorporating this.

1675
02:37:44,458 --> 02:37:48,122
Brady: I think it, it's already going to be taken care of in most cases.

1676
02:37:48,522 --> 02:37:51,164
Catlin: If I might, that's kind of my point.

1677
02:37:51,265 --> 02:37:52,866
Catlin: It seems a little bit redundant.

1678
02:37:56,339 --> 02:37:57,140
=START-17=
Nicholson: Secretary Nicholson.

1679
02:37:58,223 --> 02:38:01,388
Nicholson: I'd like to offer an amendment, if that's all right.

1680
02:38:02,991 --> 02:38:03,573
SPEAKER_10: To the amendment.

1681
02:38:03,753 --> 02:38:04,174
Nicholson: Thank you.

1682
02:38:05,396 --> 02:38:06,799
SPEAKER_10: Just to clarify, that was a question.

1683
02:38:06,919 --> 02:38:08,622
SPEAKER_10: You would like to offer an amendment to the amendment?

1684
02:38:08,983 --> 02:38:09,143
Nicholson: Yes.

1685
02:38:10,666 --> 02:38:11,327
Nicholson: Let's have an amendment.

1686
02:38:11,543 --> 02:38:12,985
Larsen: Mr. Krull.

1687
02:38:13,005 --> 02:38:41,382
Larsen: Technically the initial motion on the table is to amend the ETOD policy and this is an amendment to that amendment and at this point you would be amending an amendment to an amendment which is not allowed under Robert's rules so you would need to tackle this amendment as it's being presented and then if you feel so inclined offer an amendment to whatever state the

1688
02:38:41,362 --> 02:39:07,437
Nicholson: uh policy is in at that point rock on uh secretary yeah so at that point i would say i'd have to be a no been for the very simple reason um where it says no project will be eligible we're talking about an uh equitable tod policy here um which is specifically focused on using our land to facilitate like the literally the policy is about giving discounts um i can't see

1689
02:39:07,417 --> 02:39:30,437
Nicholson: putting something like this in there unless it is related to said discount so I'd be fine if it said additionally no project receiving a discount will be eligible for any discounts etc unless it complies with but I don't necessarily think it makes sense to do market rate policy in an etod policy thank you secretary i have treasurer banker and then director isha

1690
02:39:30,637 --> 02:39:31,959
Benker: It's just real quick.

1691
02:39:31,999 --> 02:39:45,199
Benker: Have you perhaps considered something more positive saying something like along the lines greater consideration would be given a project if these items were attained as opposed to make it mandatory?

1692
02:39:48,183 --> 02:39:49,786
SPEAKER_10: Dr. Risha or Dr. Kisman?
=END-17=

1693
02:39:49,806 --> 02:39:52,189
Benker: Again, sort of an amendment, but just a thought.

1694
02:39:52,970 --> 02:39:53,111
Paglieri: Thanks.

1695
02:39:53,131 --> 02:39:57,437
Paglieri: So I just want to address what Secretary Nicholson said.

1696
02:39:57,856 --> 02:40:05,885
Paglieri: I might have missed part of the closed captioning, but I think you said you don't think we should be applying accessibility minimums to market rate.

1697
02:40:06,826 --> 02:40:07,047
Paglieri: Okay.

1698
02:40:07,387 --> 02:40:07,988
Paglieri: That's exact.

1699
02:40:08,188 --> 02:40:08,508
Paglieri: We don't.

1700
02:40:08,829 --> 02:40:09,690
Paglieri: So this amendment doesn't do that.

1701
02:40:10,090 --> 02:40:23,226
Paglieri: And the second piece, um, the reason why I didn't say it doesn't reference discounts is because, uh, so this goes at the end of the policy, which is all, like the way it's nested under the paragraph, the discount, this is talking about when discounts apply, if that makes sense.

1702
02:40:23,606 --> 02:40:24,387
Paglieri: So it's just,

1703
02:40:25,902 --> 02:40:29,167
Paglieri: It does what you said you wanted it to do.

1704
02:40:29,187 --> 02:40:30,128
Paglieri: It's just late.

1705
02:40:30,669 --> 02:40:31,190
=START-18=
Nicholson: On Nicholson.

1706
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:31,751
Nicholson: Thank you.

1707
02:40:32,171 --> 02:40:36,358
Nicholson: And then the, I guess the only question I have for, and this is actually for Ms.

1708
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:37,900
Nicholson: Brady, if that's okay.

1709
02:40:38,401 --> 02:40:50,138
Nicholson: Under what, because you mentioned that Denver has a policy that supersede or that matches this and the state currently is considering a policy that would supersede it, but currently does not.

1710
02:40:50,675 --> 02:40:54,661
Nicholson: Under what circumstances would this have any effect at all?

1711
02:40:54,841 --> 02:41:02,933
Nicholson: Like in what circumstances can you imagine in your professional capacity, do you see this being something that would matter?

1712
02:41:04,034 --> 02:41:04,194
SPEAKER_09: Ms.

1713
02:41:04,234 --> 02:41:04,515
SPEAKER_09: Brady?

1714
02:41:05,276 --> 02:41:09,682
Brady: Yes, in a jurisdiction that doesn't currently require accessible units.

1715
02:41:09,842 --> 02:41:15,070
Brady: And Director Rush has mentioned some, I'm not aware of them, but this is not my area of expertise.

1716
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:20,057
Brady: So, but in a jurisdiction that does not already have those requirements that is not

1717
02:41:20,257 --> 02:41:33,936
Brady: accepting HUD money, and if Colorado Department of Housing changes their rules, does not accept Department of Housing money, then that project would then be subject to this policy requirement.

1718
02:41:35,819 --> 02:41:36,239
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Ms.

1719
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:36,560
SPEAKER_10: Breedy.

1720
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:37,702
SPEAKER_10: Secretary, quickly.

1721
02:41:38,543 --> 02:41:50,179
Nicholson: Yeah, just, I guess, for Director Rusher, Director Guzman, are there any jurisdictions in the RTD service area that don't have that same requirement that Denver does?

1722
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:52,901
SPEAKER_10: either directors?

1723
02:41:54,303 --> 02:41:58,991
Paglieri: Yeah, I think I'm pretty smart, but I'm not qualified to talk about 53 separate jurisdictions.
=END-18=

1724
02:41:59,051 --> 02:42:07,383
Paglieri: So I'm just going to have to lean into this is E TOD and the E is equitable.

1725
02:42:07,904 --> 02:42:13,292
Paglieri: We spend a lot of time talking about equity today, including spending a significant amount of time talking about people with disabilities.

1726
02:42:13,813 --> 02:42:19,542
Paglieri: And so just again, recognizing that the HUD requirement

1727
02:42:22,610 --> 02:42:38,492
Paglieri: is about equity and not excluding people on the basis of disability from accessing affordable housing because the FH Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and other areas of anti-discrimination law, including state law, don't effectively

1728
02:42:38,995 --> 02:42:40,377
Paglieri: covered that aspect.

1729
02:42:41,599 --> 02:42:43,041
Paglieri: Sorry, that was more than what you asked.

1730
02:42:43,061 --> 02:42:45,125
Paglieri: But no, I can't answer your question.

1731
02:42:46,867 --> 02:42:57,083
Paglieri: Just like you probably couldn't answer my question about every single jurisdiction in the RTD region that has something regarding parking minimums.

1732
02:42:58,024 --> 02:42:59,126
Paglieri: It's a broad concept.

1733
02:43:00,528 --> 02:43:01,290
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Director Usha.

1734
02:43:01,730 --> 02:43:03,773
SPEAKER_10: Any further conversation on this amendment?

1735
02:43:04,915 --> 02:43:05,636
Guzman: Dr. Guzman.

1736
02:43:05,656 --> 02:43:07,399
Guzman: I will offer this last thing.

1737
02:43:07,733 --> 02:43:21,912
Guzman: and then we probably should go to a vote, but very simply put, we need to make sure that we are protecting the vulnerable, providing access to these housing units.

1738
02:43:22,193 --> 02:43:25,477
Guzman: Even in the city and county of Denver's building codes is not clear.

1739
02:43:25,537 --> 02:43:26,839
Guzman: It's as clear as mud.

1740
02:43:27,140 --> 02:43:33,326
Guzman: There is reference to this if certain dollars are used, but stacking in the way that developers work, it's not necessarily required.

1741
02:43:33,366 --> 02:43:42,155
Guzman: We aspire to a certain ICAA rule, but it's not clear if that means that they have to do this or not in order to get licensed.

1742
02:43:42,836 --> 02:43:55,408
Guzman: And so to be fair to ourselves and to ensure that we are taking care of the ADA community and providing those accessible units, I would like to see this in the policy.

1743
02:43:55,591 --> 02:44:08,383
Guzman: I would be fine, by the way, to adjust language on this to say we would consider giving additional discount, but I don't want any project to go forward that doesn't meet a bare minimum requirement that's established.

1744
02:44:08,423 --> 02:44:20,655
Guzman: And although it is established in other places, it is not established in our policy, and we are the government of this region, and we should take it seriously that we have a due diligence and responsibility to those members of our community that would need this.

1745
02:44:20,875 --> 02:44:23,117
Guzman: Thank you.

1746
02:44:24,683 --> 02:44:30,373
Harwick: I always have to follow you, Director Guzman, but obviously I'm very in support.

1747
02:44:30,633 --> 02:44:41,672
Harwick: Any time that we can be supportive of our communities most in need, those suffering from a whole variety of disabilities, I want to be able to put our best foot forward there.

1748
02:44:42,113 --> 02:44:46,540
Harwick: And while we can't call specific jurisdictions, if there is that

1749
02:44:46,520 --> 02:44:53,495
Harwick: chance that there is a jurisdiction that isn't meeting this requirement, then we should make sure we're getting there.

1750
02:44:53,555 --> 02:44:59,087
Harwick: And if in the process the state comes up with something better or something in the future, that's okay.

1751
02:44:59,448 --> 02:45:06,503
Harwick: But I think that this is a safety net in my mind about how to really get there for this community.

1752
02:45:08,727 --> 02:45:25,158
Harwick: I think that also, as we're tying these developments, spur off around our transit, that's also giving them better access to the resources and giving them the life that they want and the freedom of movement that we so cherish.

1753
02:45:25,218 --> 02:45:27,242
Harwick: So I'm highly in support of this.

1754
02:45:27,222 --> 02:45:27,562
SPEAKER_10: Thank you.

1755
02:45:28,043 --> 02:45:29,304
Harwick: Secretary, less than 30 seconds.

1756
02:45:30,606 --> 02:45:34,170
=START-19=
Nicholson: This question is for Chessie.

1757
02:45:34,410 --> 02:45:42,299
Nicholson: My understanding with this language is that it applies to buildings with elevators in it.

1758
02:45:42,419 --> 02:45:56,976
Nicholson: And so with single stair buildings, that there are different policies around equitable access because of the challenges, obviously, in a single stair building of getting people into the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth floor.

1759
02:45:57,277 --> 02:46:00,686
Nicholson: You're probably the biggest expert on this in the room.

1760
02:46:01,869 --> 02:46:13,159
Nicholson: Do you see any concerns with this language when it comes to buildings with stairs only versus elevators?

1761
02:46:13,865 --> 02:46:23,579
Brady: I am not the biggest expert on this in the room, but I would say that equitable, I do know that equitable access and accessible units are different things and have different requirements.

1762
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:27,885
Brady: And so we're talking specifically about accessible units.

1763
02:46:29,207 --> 02:46:35,476
Brady: We're also not, we're tending to be talking about larger buildings because we do want them to be dense at stations.

1764
02:46:35,497 --> 02:46:40,183
Brady: So I think they're typically going to be elevator buildings, but I don't have any concerns about that.

1765
02:46:40,203 --> 02:46:40,584
SPEAKER_10: Thank you, Ms.

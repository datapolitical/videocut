1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
 We're convened as of 3.31 p.m. I'd respectfully ask everyone to remain

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,440
 muted unless you're recognized to speak. I will now call the roll.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,760
 Treasure banker? Present. Director Buzic? I believe he's gonna be a couple minutes

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:26,000
 late. Director Catlin? Here. Director Chandler?

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,640
 Not here. Director Geisinger? Director Guchenutter? Here. Director Guzman?

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:42,280
 Present. Director Harwick? Here. Director Larson? Here. Secretary Nicholson? Choo-choo.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,720
 First Vice Chair O'Keefe? Ecstatic to be here. Director Pagulari? Present.

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:59,440
 Director Ruche? No. Director Ruche? Second Vice Chair Whitmore? Present.

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:12,680
 Alright. So we have 12 present and 3 absent. We do have a quorum. Please note

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,320
 that the special board meeting does have a section for public comment this

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,760
 afternoon. However, the public can still offer comments, excuse me, does not have a

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,000
 section for public comment this afternoon. However, the public can still offer

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,080
 comments via email or by participating in person or remotely during the regular

14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,120
 scheduled meeting, which will be happening later this evening, either at

15
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,280
 5.30 or potentially a little bit later, depending how long our special board

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,960
 meeting happens this afternoon. Alright. So we have our external entities report

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,320
 and this external entities report will be coming from the joint rail service

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,320
 update. For today's special board meeting, we have just the one and today's

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,240
 special guest is going to be Diane Barrett, Special Advisor to the Governor

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,760
 for Joint Rail Service. Before I ask Ms. Barrett to begin, I would want to offer

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,960
 the floor to GM CEO Johnson for some opening remarks. Ms. Johnson, the floor is

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,280
 yours. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Good afternoon to all board members

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,920
 assembled and those members of the public. Before we get started, just for a point

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,080
 of clarification, I do know that Lisa Kaufman is present as well, Senior

25
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,560
 Advisor to the Governor, who will be part of the presentation this afternoon. I

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
 also like to acknowledge Ms. Elmer Hutchinson, our Deputy General Counsel,

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,820
 who is sitting in today as General Counsel. And then more specifically, we

28
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,500
 have in the audience our Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who all formally

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,520
 introduced during the course of the public board meeting. But for the matter

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,720
 at hand today, as relates to the progress relative to joint service and working

31
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,960
 with five other entities aside from, of course, ourselves with RTD and coming

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,440
 forward with options relative to bringing passenger rail service to the front range

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,440
 more specifically along the Northwest Corridor, we have been involved in

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,680
 meetings and working diligently and our colleagues from the state are here to

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,420
 provide an overview. With that as a backdrop, there'll be an opportunity

36
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,880
 whereby this body will go into executive session and we can have a more in-depth

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,740
 discussion pertinent to next steps. So with that, Mr. Chair, I would ask Ms.

38
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:28,400
 Barrett and Ms. Kaufman to join us at the U-shaped table for their

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,120
 presentation this afternoon. Thank you.

40
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:58,180
 Ms. Barrett and Ms. Kaufman, thank you for joining us. The floor is

41
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,720
 yours. Thank you very much. Thank you, General Manager Johnson, for that

42
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:13,660
 introduction. This is my fourth appearance, I believe, with you folks. So I hope

43
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:20,320
 that you're not getting bored with us. Lisa's gonna start us off and we'll go

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,280
 through an overview of where we are and what we've been doing and then we'll

45
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,160
 have a quick overview of the IGA, which you've all been looking at and thinking

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:44,640
 about for a while and then that'll be it and questions. Great, thanks Diane. So I'll

47
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,040
 get an overview on where we've been to date and what the overall timeline for

48
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:01,760
 the project is. So some background is SB 184 was signed into law May of 2024

49
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,080
 and in this new law it created a new congestion fee of three dollars a day on

50
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,360
 daily rental cars, which is estimated to bring in a new 57 million dollars in FY

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,080
 26 before growing to over a hundred and ten million dollars by 2050 and in that

52
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,760
 law it directed RTD front-range passenger rail and CDOT to collaborate

53
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,560
 to deliver on starter service for inner-city passenger rail from Denver to

54
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,480
 Fort Collins by January 2029. It allowed the entities to contemplate three

55
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,560
 different ways to govern this collaborative to deliver passenger rail

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,160
 through either an IGA or a new Colorado Rail Authority or an altogether new

57
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,040
 legal authority and what the principals kind of rallied around early on was the

58
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,600
 concept of an IGA given that all the existing entities had the legal

59
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,200
 authority they needed to govern the service and enter into the service

60
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,560
 through an IGA. I would say that some previous board members from RTD during

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,120
 the process of this legislation were advocates for the new Colorado Rail

62
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,200
 Authority as a potential solution and that idea still has some merit but the

63
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,440
 legislation did not create an appropriation to do a proper study on

64
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,800
 that concept so early on that concept was really only given a cursory look as

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,440
 it's a complicated endeavor that would have needed in appropriation to do a

66
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,960
 full analysis on that concept so it's just worth noting it's not that the

67
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,080
 principals decided that concept was without merit it just was something that

68
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,800
 would have needed far more resources to really explore that as a viable

69
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:03,240
 governance option. Also in last year's legislative session SP 230 passed which

70
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,040
 is a new production fee on oil and gas extraction. This law is forecasted in its

71
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,840
 first full year to bring in around a hundred and ten million dollars. The

72
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,920
 lion's share beneficiary will likely be RTD as 70% of it is to go out to local

73
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,520
 transit agencies for increasing service and ridership that is to go out

74
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,200
 formulaically 70% of it and then there is a 20% set aside for passenger rail

75
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,200
 that calls out prioritization for completion of the Northwest rail and the

76
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:51,440
 end line. This is a project overview for the work around joint service so as I

77
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,560
 just went through May 2024 SP 184 and SP 230 was signed into law. In August of

78
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:08,760
 2024 the principals of joint service met so general managers from RTD, FRPRD,

79
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:15,240
 Director Liu and the governor and decided to bring on the ever talented

80
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,960
 Diane Barrett to help lead that this project and lead the interagency

81
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,160
 coordination. You know part of the reason why the principals decided to bring on

82
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,480
 Diane is that one of the most successful collaboratives that the state of Colorado

83
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,320
 has seen was the renovation and revitalization of Union Station which

84
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,200
 required a lot of coordination among many different public entities to come

85
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,240
 together to come up with the creative financing mechanism to get that done and

86
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,760
 Diane led that project for then Mayor Hickenlooper as the first chief project

87
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,920
 officer and so we're very blessed for her to come out of retirement to come

88
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,000
 lead this and do it again because it is a Herculean effort to coordinate this

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,800
 many public entities with their own policies bylaws and enabling legislation

90
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,200
 and so there really is truly no one better to do this work than Diane which

91
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,840
 then led to the March 1st report that had an initial cost estimate in review

92
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,520
 of available revenue streams and review of governance models and so we'll review

93
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,880
 a little bit of what the March 1st report said but in you know succinctly

94
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,440
 it said that there is enough existing resources and that an IGA is the

95
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,780
 preferred governance model to deliver joint service. We have since spent the

96
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:47,440
 time since March 1st refining the study and looking at updating the cost

97
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,760
 estimates based off of the feedback from the March 1st report based off of

98
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,960
 additional feedback from BNSF and drafting the IGA and doing workshops

99
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,880
 like we are here today with the governing boards. So the drafting of the

100
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,760
 IGA has been led by Diane but also the general counsels from RTD, FRPRD and

101
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,680
 the attorney general's office and we have now done workshops including today

102
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,440
 with all the governing boards we expect that feedback from all of the workshops

103
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,600
 and the ongoing drafting will continue until about mid-June in which we hope to

104
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,540
 be able to circulate a final draft in mid-June for board adoptions this summer

105
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,660
 in June and July.

106
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:43,760
 So this is a project timeline moving forward and kind of gets at the heart of

107
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,240
 what is the IGA about but final steps as I said is to circulate a final draft of

108
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,400
 the IGA in June and then start operating under the governance of the IGA to

109
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,040
 speak with one voice in negotiations with BNSF with the hope of getting an

110
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,240
 access agreement with BNSF and be able to then have a finance model based off

111
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,760
 of the actual cost based off of the actual infrastructure list negotiated

112
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:22,000
 with BNSF and that at that point we would then be asking for boards to adopt

113
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,820
 financial plans based off of the actual negotiations with BNSF and that that

114
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,880
 would then kick off kind of the procurement for operator and executing of

115
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,520
 financing any NEPA's that are needed construction and safety testing with the

116
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:45,920
 commencement of service in January 2029. One thing I would say about this is I

117
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,640
 was just the state's chief negotiator for the Union Pacific Access Agreement for

118
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,640
 Mountain Rail which was a good learning experience to understand how those

119
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:04,060
 documents answer a lot of the questions that I'm sure you all have on how is the

120
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,960
 infrastructure cost associated with this determined what's the timeline who does

121
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:16,720
 the work how is it going to proceed and so that access agreement is foundational

122
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,680
 to any project for passenger rail and what we have heard loud and clear from

123
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:31,160
 BNSF is that the need for joint service is because right now absent having an IGA

124
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,880
 that says we're going to deliver passenger rail on the northern sub

125
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,380
 collaboratively there is multiple different public agencies that are

126
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,680
 planning passenger rail projects on the northern sub that they own from

127
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,220
 Denver Union Station to Fort Collins and that if those projects were to proceed

128
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,400
 in a silo that adds a level of complexity and conflict with freight

129
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,840
 operations that would have a cost estimate impact to all projects so to

130
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,640
 put that more succinctly if Front Range passenger rail were to price out their

131
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:12,560
 project right now BNSF would assume the infrastructure needs for Northwest Rail

132
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,940
 in addition to Front Range passenger rail which would balloon the cost for Front

133
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,280
 Range passenger rail as there are multiple passenger rail systems planned

134
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,840
 and so the interagency agreement is designed to really say that the public

135
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,160
 agencies are going to work together to get one access agreement and have one

136
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,320
 operator to create that efficiencies for both the taxpayer and fee payers that

137
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,960
 would be funding the service but also to reduce any conflict with freight

138
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,420
 operations both from a safety perspective but also from a freight

139
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,840
 business perspective and so the goal of the IGA is to say this is how we will

140
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,820
 work together here's the core principles of the collaborative and be able to go

141
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,080
 speak with one voice in those negotiations with BNSF so that we can

142
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,200
 get the most cost-efficient passenger rail system on the northern Front Range

143
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,500
 that I think I turn it over to Diane to go over key takeaways from the March

144
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,120
 1st report

145
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,720
 thank you Lisa

146
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:35,080
 from the March 1st report we or by the time of the March 1st report we had

147
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,600
 learned that there are enough existing resources from the concession impact fee

148
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,880
 and the production fee in SB 184 and SB 230 and RTD's sales tax to cover the

149
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,160
 cost of three daily round trips remember that we were asked to look at three and

150
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:06,400
 five round trips any appropriation made by any of the parties ie the agencies is

151
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,200
 subject to policy and decision budget decisions of the governing boards

152
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:20,920
 something for you all specifically to keep in mind general manager Johnson will

153
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:30,080
 be coming to you for your prior approval before any action is is taken three

154
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,840
 daily round trips is estimated to cost 83 million dollars in the first year of

155
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:44,160
 operations 32 million of that is O&M plus 51 million in debt service we will

156
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,360
 be updating those numbers which are the same numbers you saw the last two times

157
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,800
 I was here I believe we'll be updating those in the next coming weeks and in

158
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:03,720
 our June presentation to you we will have very interesting new numbers to show

159
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:13,440
 you if the state contributes 42 million dollars annually from 230 and 184

160
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:21,040
 numbers there is a gap of 41 million dollars to be filled by RTD

161
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:30,640
 the peak rail study that you folks did at great costs recently and by the way we

162
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,280
 are using data from that report constantly it's been a tremendous boom

163
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:42,160
 to joint service to have that study in place so you should be proud of that

164
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:50,440
 anyway three trains from Denver to only to Longmont is said to be 52 to 56

165
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,960
 million dollars annually for you by yourselves so 41 million is

166
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,440
 significantly less than that and the service would be connecting twice than

167
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,320
 an amount of population that would be going to Fort Collins rather than just

168
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:15,360
 to Longmont nearly all of the infrastructure investments for the joint

169
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,040
 service that we're planning would benefit the eventual front-range passenger rail

170
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,000
 further study is needed to define the service negotiate an access agreement

171
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,800
 with BNSF develop an internet agency agreement and importantly a financial

172
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,040
 plan that will work

173
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:46,200
 why did we decide to do an intergovernmental agreement the

174
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:54,400
 remaining choice as you heard from Lisa earlier was really establishing a new

175
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,440
 entity a new public entity that's what we did in Denver Union Station and we did

176
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:10,520
 it there for various reasons it was kind of a first shot out of the box and we

177
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:20,400
 did it Ms. Catlin sat on our original board so we did we did feel that after

178
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:28,040
 the fact probably could have done it with an IGA it was a big complication

179
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:34,640
 but we decided in this instance that the agencies were familiar enough with each

180
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,560
 other that we could probably do this with an intergovernmental agreement less

181
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:49,000
 expense less time and we think that we will have a binding agreement that can

182
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,400
 be to everybody's benefit so we decided that we would have the

183
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:10,400
 collaboration that we need and be able to establish a governance process we

184
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,560
 didn't really need a lot more than that to get started so remember what we're

185
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,500
 doing is a starter service so the IGA creates a Joint Service Executive

186
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:30,720
 Oversight Committee JSEOC that acts on behalf of the group and remember that

187
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:39,400
 the group is the executives of each of the agencies so the group is General

188
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:48,960
 Manager Johnson it's hard not to say Debra sorry and our president

189
00:19:48,960 --> 00:20:05,680
 actually the executives are the voting body that I'm sorry I'm thinking of our

190
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:13,360
 principles meetings in which you attend and so does the board chair of FRPRD but

191
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:21,560
 the voting members of the JSEOC are General Manager Johnson interim general

192
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:30,280
 manager Chrissy Bright at FRPRD the executive of CTIO the executive of CTE

193
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:40,160
 and Shoshana Liu or her delicate and the governor or his which is Lisa

194
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:51,200
 the JSEOC becomes the single entity that BNSF has been asking for all along he

195
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,400
 wants one neck to choke I guess way that you can think about that

196
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,340
 the IGA does not supersede or impact the authority of any body so all of the

197
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,520
 boards act just as they always have you will continue to have the control that

198
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:19,840
 you want and need in order to fulfill your obligations fiduciary and otherwise

199
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,200
 the boards will make all decisions regarding appropriations budgeting

200
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,120
 funding unless those decisions have been expressly dedicated by the individual

201
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:38,600
 governing body to someone for instance your general manager

202
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:47,080
 it is expected that the JSEOC will make the decisions that they make by a

203
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:55,600
 measure of 50 percent plus one which so you don't have to do the arithmetic is a

204
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:05,440
 vote of four to prevail upon an adoption of the financial plan and this is at the

205
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,800
 end of at the conclusion of a successful negotiation with BNSF when we have

206
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:20,040
 learned what the real costs are of this project and we have learned how big your

207
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,460
 financial contributions will be and that financial plan will be adopted and after

208
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:41,360
 that all voting will be majority just a majority vote unless and until one person

209
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,480
 or more than one choose to ask for a weighted vote this is not a sure thing

210
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,360
 but today we are still carrying a weighted vote opportunity after the

211
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:02,440
 adoption of the financial plan if one of the members asks for a weighted vote

212
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,360
 that will happen and it the waiting is as of the contributions of the parties

213
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:17,920
 and contributions of course will be carefully carefully defined and is still

214
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,360
 a very open definition in the documents

215
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,020
 so

216
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:44,460
 so sorry thank you Lisa the JSEOC will steer the negotiations with BNSF will be

217
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,020
 responsible for soliciting an operator for the passenger rail service and they

218
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,800
 will be laying the foundation for the future expansion of the Front Range

219
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,720
 passenger district the JSEOC will strive to implement the joint service project

220
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,320
 in such a way that it will not render infeasible the existing operations of

221
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,720
 RTD or the future plans for the Front Range passenger rail district that

222
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,400
 sounds very legal and a little bit hard to operate with so we're looking at that

223
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,960
 language and trying hard to come up with a language that will assure that the

224
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,920
 Front Range passenger rail is not impeded in the future by what we're doing

225
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,840
 with our project with the small starter small project that we're working on

226
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:44,360
 today the IGA also provides a process for transfer of interests assets and

227
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:51,960
 obligations of one of the parties to others or to outsiders as well this is a

228
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,520
 process that again is still under discussion and redrafting to try to make

229
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:11,080
 it a fair way to transfer if trans such transfer is wanted it actually is

230
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,600
 important in order to assure that in the in the event of a need to break up the

231
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:27,360
 partnership we have a orderly process in place that will help that happen there

232
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,280
 are many instances of large groups of participants who end up not being able

233
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,800
 to make work and it's best to have a process in place in the original

234
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,920
 agreement if possible

235
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:51,640
 so our timeline in May just barely we managed to get the workshops all done

236
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:59,400
 with parties in June we'll do another RTD board update and that one will in

237
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,840
 entail some specificity about dollars and cents that we don't have quite yet

238
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,360
 and certainly it will lead us on the pathway to negotiations with BNSF which

239
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,840
 obviously have to occur and conclude before we will know what the financial

240
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,620
 picture really is and adopt a financial plan for the project June and July the

241
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:32,600
 boards begin voting and approving the IGA so in June the CTIO the CTE and the

242
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,480
 Transportation Commission will all have their opportunity to approve to approve

243
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,440
 the IGA in June the FRPRD will have their opportunity to approve the IGA and

244
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,000
 then in July you folks will have your opportunity to do the same you get to

245
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,240
 be last through the winter all the boards will work to adopt the financial

246
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,840
 plan again it would be negotiations with the NSF are critical and key here and

247
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,320
 those have to be ongoing and we hope that during the winter all the boards

248
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,720
 will be able to adopt a financial plan that's based on the successful access

249
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,760
 agreement and construction agreements that we've achieved with the NSF the

250
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,640
 summer of next year the JSEOC will conduct procurement for rolling stock

251
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:39,960
 and for the operator and then in January of 2029 joint service train begins

252
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:50,040
 that's you know tomorrow in the rain in the train world so optimistic aggressive

253
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:57,940
 yes just real quick as a correction miss Barrett it says winner of 2026 on there

254
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:06,200
 I believe it is winner of 2025 all boards to adopt financial plan yes could

255
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,000
 expand the year 26 in January okay thank you

256
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,800
 but hopefully hopefully thank you chairman bouquet so in the June board

257
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:29,200
 update what will I do just another boring turnout but we'll have sent out

258
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:37,880
 the finalized IGA draft on all board workshops the new cost estimate by H&T B

259
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:45,520
 will be presented very interesting we have looked in all the couch covers and

260
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,160
 we have found many pennies so we are we're going to be showing to you some

261
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,240
 new numbers there will be a new financial scenario based on those new

262
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,780
 cost estimates and this time will include Fairbox collections because we

263
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,360
 will have ridership scenarios by that time for you which I'm sure will be very

264
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,360
 interested all of you the ridership model is completed and we'll be able to

265
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,200
 present it to you and then we'll have an operations report that will provide

266
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:27,920
 analyses financially and operationally to date so I believe that that's it for

267
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,740
 our report and we'd be pleased to take your question excellent well thank you

268
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,240
 both for coming in and joining us again we greatly appreciate and greatly

269
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,280
 appreciate your guys's time so now I'm gonna leave it up to the board if they

270
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:51,240
 have any questions for the two of you so there any directors who have questions

271
00:29:51,240 --> 00:30:00,480
 treasure Banker well first of all thank you for coming again we you've been

272
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,440
 doing yeoman's work here and providing leadership on this project which is

273
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,680
 extremely valuable and appreciated I do have a couple of questions actually I've

274
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,560
 got many I'll keep it short though when you talk about a weighted vote for this

275
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,920
 joint operating agreement could you give me an example how would that work

276
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:46,520
 well Lisa chip in afterwards a weighted vote would give more weight to to a vote

277
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:53,240
 by a party that has contributed more than another party so the definition of

278
00:30:53,240 --> 00:31:03,400
 contributions is being heavily debated among the council guided by their

279
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:10,160
 principles of course and and there are lots of different ideas about how to do

280
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:18,840
 that for instance we had in one draft the specifics of the peak rail study as

281
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,720
 having been an expenditure that RTD would get credited with because it was

282
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,040
 huge amount of money I think eight million dollars or something like that

283
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:38,040
 as you all know better than I do and the BNSF study so wanting to make sure

284
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:46,280
 that that was included in contributions and it was suggested I think from from

285
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,240
 your counsel and we were talking about it behind the scenes and we said well

286
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,240
 you know we don't want everybody putting in every example of every time they've

287
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,180
 spent money and so forth and so we'll just say by exam we won't say by example

288
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:08,960
 we'll just say here's the definition of what a contribution is it became clear

289
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:16,400
 to us that we specifically wanted to delineate the peak study because a it

290
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,400
 was unique among other studies and expenditures that people have have made

291
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:30,440
 but we still don't want to enumerate every single expenditure but we're going

292
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,640
 to put that one in specifically because it was large and it was important

293
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:42,200
 throughout our studies and will continue to be so contributions is a financial

294
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:51,560
 contribution that again will the the definition will be further refined as we

295
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,240
 talk more mr. chair if I if I could continue then how would you something to

296
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,280
 think about you don't have to answer it right now but they're very well maybe

297
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,920
 one-time contributions that are made as well as annual contributions that are

298
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,240
 made so however that is calculated hopefully that is taken into

299
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:19,800
 consideration well the amounts right total and in integrate integral would be

300
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:29,120
 heavily a part of the amount itself is a very important part of the analysis okay

301
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,600
 and then one more question then if you don't mind yeah treasure a total

302
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:43,080
 contribution director banker a total contribution would be even if you were

303
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,360
 paying it over time it was the total contribution would be what you would be

304
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,000
 so if there was a bond then you would calculate the 30-year payment of a bond

305
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,280
 as well as one-time deposit yes say at the beginning of the project yes okay

306
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,280
 interesting you had mentioned that you're talking between three and five

307
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:13,040
 trips a day how are you where are we in the potential of five trips

308
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,320
 I'm gonna ask Lisa to take that one yeah so I think there was an updated cost

309
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,520
 estimate that looked at the five round trips and I think that it's really kind

310
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,480
 of on the bubble if there is enough existing resources at this point to

311
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,680
 pursue five round trips and so we've really been focusing on the three daily

312
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,080
 round trips it's also been you know an active dialogue with BNSF and they

313
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:49,280
 certainly would prefer that any interagency agreement be prioritizing

314
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,040
 starting off at two to three round trips with the you know expectation that you

315
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,640
 would increase frequency as new resources became available and as the

316
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,120
 service was successful in operating on their line with the existing

317
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,960
 infrastructure dictated in the access agreement and so it's not envisioned

318
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,800
 that you would end without amount of frequency but that that's where you your

319
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,400
 starting point is and as you might know FRPRD is currently doing open open

320
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,720
 houses and workshops on their alternative analysis and part of the

321
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,560
 alternative analysis for front-range passenger rail is a benchmark study of

322
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,600
 all inner-city passenger rail services in the country and what they looked at

323
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,200
 was where do they start and where do they kind of top out and what you find

324
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,400
 is a lot start with two to three round trips and then the kind of high level is

325
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,840
 you know between 12 and 16 round trips for inner city passenger rail and so

326
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,400
 that is kind of the range in which we would expect to try to reach eventually

327
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,280
 with our ridership demand being built up and with added capacity on the line to

328
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,680
 accommodate new frequency is certainly all the state's hope that front-range

329
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,120
 passenger rail eventually goes to the ballot and is successful so that we can

330
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,080
 increase frequency with new resources that they bring to the table. Thank you

331
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,960
 treasurer. Prior to recognizing first vice chair O'Keeffe I do want to make I do

332
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,960
 want to make note that at around 340 director Buza and director Usha did

333
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,880
 join us online thank you first vice chair O'Keeffe. Thank you

334
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,160
 mr. chair and I will note that director Buza put his hand up as soon as he got

335
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:49,720
 on the call he didn't even know what we were debating at this time so you know

336
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,920
 what they call going to the same body four times and not getting what they call

337
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,880
 the body that you go to four times and they don't get this don't get a yes

338
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:05,120
 parole board so you're coming to the parole board so the a couple things that

339
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,720
 actually the previous question we think of it is there a minimum contribution is

340
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,680
 it's of an entity doesn't give any money or do they get no vote when you go to a

341
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:32,240
 waiting boat okay yeah I'm not generally quiet so so could you repeat that real

342
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,460
 quick explain explain how that for the recording that would work I'm sorry how

343
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,160
 would that work so if you if you're pro rate if you're pro rating out based on

344
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,160
 contribution but there are entities that don't give anything do you give them they

345
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:56,280
 get a minimum like 10% vote or what's the idea on the waiting and it it will

346
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,520
 matter more in construction right so I mean I'm particularly interested in if

347
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,200
 we're gonna wait waiting it correctly well and and that's why we're struggling

348
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,620
 with the language of both the definition of definite of contributions and with

349
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:22,000
 how the actual weighted works so there is no there is no thought of taking away a

350
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:32,840
 vote so each of the six has a vote and for most most actions that will be taken

351
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:40,980
 everybody's vote will be the same after the the adoption of the finance plan and

352
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,640
 when we're actually you know creating a project that has a cost and a budget and

353
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,760
 is sticking with all of that then then most votes will be one vote one person

354
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:03,560
 but if we have to go to a weighted vote the amount of

355
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:11,960
 votes will increase by the contribution level okay can I maybe jump in with an

356
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,080
 example of this so I think that the current way the IGA has contemplated is

357
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,640
 the bodies would govern with 50% plus one and that would be you know the

358
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,320
 governing rules through negotiations with BNSF to get to an access agreement

359
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,240
 then a finance plan would come out of the access agreement based off of

360
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,600
 actually having an infrastructure project list and more solid numbers an

361
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,920
 instance in where you might want a weighted vote is you know say the

362
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,020
 services and operation for three years and we think that it's worth having a

363
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,800
 discussion on adding a siding because it might improve performance and you know

364
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,700
 being on time performance you would presume that the entities would then

365
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:06,520
 vote through 50% plus one but somebody could ask for a weighted vote on that

366
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,600
 decision based off of contributions it's designed to give an added layer of

367
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,960
 protection for the entities that are contributing large amounts but of course

368
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,800
 there's another layer of protection for the agencies that are contributing to

369
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,300
 the service because all of those appropriations still have to be

370
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,480
 appropriated by the originating board and nobody could be forced by the

371
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,880
 interagency agreement to appropriate any money for the service and so it's just

372
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,720
 an added layer of protection for the entities that have the most equity into

373
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,640
 the service okay but I think that the practice what we expect to see is that

374
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:52,800
 the majority rule would be how decisions are made I would hope so but if you need

375
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,360
 to go to a weighted vote things aren't going well so I think you may want to

376
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:03,480
 war game out how that would would work and so just a couple things can we get a

377
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:11,600
 copy of the idea I I've asked just about everybody I almost asked a guy out on the

378
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:18,760
 street I might have it so I looked at general manager Johnson but my

379
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,680
 understanding was that the general counsels for each agency was sharing

380
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,240
 with their governing boards to protect client privilege so I don't know where

381
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,440
 that may be got lost in translation but that's how we've done it at least in the

382
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,240
 executive branch where each Attorney General assigned to each agency has

383
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,160
 shared it with those boards that's perfect she did she just gave me the

384
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,560
 answer with her she didn't even have to leer at me the so the only other things

385
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:56,000
 and I just I think this is important to at least start talking about in the

386
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,360
 context the IGA I understand the IGA is not designed to set a budget request but

387
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,120
 I do think it should set parameters that that under no circumstances aboard would

388
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,560
 support that's so we have to decide voting ourselves what is something we

389
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,680
 would know would not accept and I'll give you two examples that I will

390
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:26,200
 specifically ask for first who's the backstop if it goes over if I know it'll

391
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,160
 shock people for me to think that a rail project might be over budget but just in

392
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,200
 case we found one that does who pays and at what at what percentage because and I

393
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,480
 think that's really important going into negotiations with BNSF because that's

394
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,360
 gonna be your biggest expenditure and they need to people should know their

395
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,560
 negotiating position before they go in with BNSF and I think that's that helps

396
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,360
 the negotiators it's it's also helpful that the board say look under no

397
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,620
 circumstances and with a backstop we will give you the amount of money in the

398
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,560
 agreement and no more or we will give you more and this is what our percentage

399
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,340
 looks like it's I think that's really really important the second thing is and

400
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,780
 this is this is a like a cut-and-dry issue for me under no circumstances can

401
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,920
 all the fights and money go to this project there are several unfinished

402
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:25,920
 projects in fast tracks and there are a lot of disappointed voters and I'm not

403
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,480
 saying it has to be counted out percentage-wise to the penny there

404
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,300
 certainly could be greater weighting to this project because it actually has a

405
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:41,000
 greater chance of going forward but under no circumstances would I vote for

406
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,160
 anything that is takes the vast honor into the FISA money because I probably

407
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,120
 wouldn't make it back across the Douglas County line alive so that's just I think

408
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,280
 those parameters that we can start to stake out for you before we vote would

409
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,960
 be really helpful so the negotiators aren't left in a tough position sorry

410
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,740
 mr. chair can I react to that so the goal would be that the access agreement

411
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,960
 would have an infrastructure list that corresponds with you know the daily

412
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:20,200
 round trips right so it might be that for instance if you want it five daily

413
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,880
 round trips that that would require seven new sightings and then what the

414
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,400
 finance plan would then say is here are the sightings that are needed in order

415
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,680
 to accommodate the five daily round trips here are the ones that are in the

416
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,040
 RTD region here are the ones that are out and then that finance plan would be

417
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:48,080
 what came back you know next winter to say here's kind of the pieces of who's

418
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,440
 gonna finance what and then to your point then if any one project goes over

419
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,520
 what does that look like and how do you handle any overages but it would be what

420
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,440
 our anticipation based off of the current cost estimates right is if we're

421
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,840
 negotiating for two or three daily round trips with them is that there is that

422
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,120
 infrastructure cost associated with it we have some ideas of what those are

423
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,640
 based off of the RTC modeling that was done ahead of the March 1st report and

424
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,880
 the RTC model is based off of the business data provided under an NDA from

425
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,000
 BNSF so it's a very informed cost estimate what is coming back to you in

426
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,400
 June is since then we've gotten we passed review at the FRA under the new

427
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,920
 administration for the Chrissy Grant so we know that those costs are going to be

428
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,160
 covered now through that Chrissy Grant so those kind of refinements is coming

429
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,600
 back but but really that finance plan has to be based off of the actual

430
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,840
 agreement with BNSF for the actual projects and then understanding how that

431
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,720
 each one of those gets financed is what we anticipate yeah I appreciate all that

432
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,480
 that really helps the the I guess the the challenge is there's a there's a

433
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,240
 finite amount that we would chip in and I don't know what that is yet yeah but

434
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,920
 that would be the only money coming from this body I don't think that there's I

435
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,000
 mean I get almost get an informal vote right now that we would enter an

436
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,160
 agreement where we did not know what our obligation was and and and did not know

437
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,920
 who was responsible when we exceeded that that original budget it might be us

438
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:41,800
 that's fine but we need to delineate who who's what and the the railroad

439
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,960
 negotiation will be murkier than we want this

440
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,400
 miss Barrett and I have done one railroad negotiation before and they

441
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,520
 everything is tied together in some sort of safety plan they rarely will say this

442
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:04,120
 siding is the responsibility of this customer it's all they're very good at

443
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:13,040
 creating a mismatch of of requirements and costs in fact they're experts at it

444
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,840
 yeah I would say that our hope is that it's enumerated in the agreement and in

445
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,920
 the mountain rail access agreement that we just completed on May 1st it is all

446
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,480
 enumerate it for the project by segment in which phase that you run does it

447
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,440
 trigger the need for that infrastructure so I think our hope is that we would be

448
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,720
 able to accomplish that same sort of format that we just did I would say on

449
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,200
 your other feedback on on finished fast tracks projects I mean I think that it's

450
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,580
 hopefully clear to all if not maybe worth stating that certainly we would

451
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:51,480
 like to partner to finish all of them and to bring state resources to partner

452
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:58,680
 to finish all of them it is called out in Senate bill SB 230 that the rail set

453
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:05,280
 aside is for both Northwest rail and the end line and I think that the hope is

454
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,840
 that we can get some clarity on where the communities are on the Southwest

455
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,560
 extension and the Five Points Project to understand how the state could also

456
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:21,040
 partner on those so it's probably worth me stating that on the mic is that the

457
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,560
 state wants to partner to finish all on finished fast-tracks projects as we see

458
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:31,120
 this out there as a threat to voter confidence for us to get to where we

459
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,640
 want to go on our climate goals thank you first vice chair Keith director

460
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:43,400
 of music thank you very much and again thank you to miss pop in and despair it

461
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,760
 for once again coming in and giving us an update but one question and two

462
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,080
 comments and my first the question has to do with SB 230 and that set aside the

463
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,920
 20 percent set aside for Northwest rail and the end line and I just don't

464
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,920
 remember does the legislation determine the proportion that those lines share

465
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,480
 that 20 percent or not anybody can answer that that might know it does not

466
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,560
 it just calls out prioritizing that 20 percent set aside for those two projects

467
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:24,560
 and so in the first report what we did was for just the exercise of trying to

468
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,480
 identify is there enough unallocated resources to cover the cost was to just

469
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,440
 assume a 50/50 split but that is a decision that the clean transit

470
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,520
 enterprise board needs to make okay so that's the the entity that would make

471
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:46,440
 that decision okay yeah I just would not want to see the end line swept away to

472
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,000
 to put all the money into this project so the other comments and it's been

473
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,560
 touched on and I have more things but I'll bring this up in executive session

474
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:02,440
 I think it's more appropriate for that but the access agreement BNS BNSF it

475
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,640
 are you gonna negotiate the cost of increased frequency because I can see

476
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,520
 them saying listen when you guys are ready to go to nine or ten or twelve

477
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,680
 trips a day come on back in and we'll talk and then then they've got you so

478
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,960
 hopefully we can get some incremental increase amounts or prices or cost

479
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,840
 worked into that access agreement because I can see that coming back to

480
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,840
 bite us if we don't and last but not least I mentioned all along you know we

481
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:42,400
 did that the peak service rail study and the per rider subsidy number scary so

482
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,880
 hopefully now I've heard allusion to basically doubling population that this

483
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,080
 line can serve and hopefully with that we'll bring that number down I'm still

484
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:58,800
 hoping to see an update on ridership projections on this whole line and what

485
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,820
 that does to the provider subsidy and that's all I have for now but I'm I'm

486
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,280
 looking forward to it I said it once I said it again this is the only way we're

487
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:13,000
 getting rail up there and I hope we do it so thanks a lot thank you director one

488
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,960
 thing I would just react to of the overall cost per rider and you know this

489
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,880
 is an unfortunate fact for this line but the single biggest infrastructure cost

490
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,160
 for this line is to add positive train control from Westminster to Fort

491
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,560
 Collins and this is a basic safety system that you would hope was on an

492
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,960
 existing freight line that is moving you know all sorts of petrochemicals and

493
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,840
 hazardous on freight through our northern suburbs today but it's not

494
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:50,760
 mandated for them to move those free products today it's only mandated when

495
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,200
 you add passenger rail onto the line and so when you look at the cost a lot of it

496
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,600
 is driven by the need for positive train control which is a significant

497
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,720
 improvement to safety for those communities that I would love to see

498
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,600
 today but it's regulated at the federal level we can't regulate it at the state

499
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:13,840
 level it is a big part of the Christie grant is extending positive train

500
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:20,040
 control up to Broomfield and it's a service I think to safety to all of us

501
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,800
 to invest in getting positive train control on this line for freight

502
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,880
 operations which is why we were able to successfully partner with BNSF to get

503
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,320
 that Christie grant and the way that that worked was we took the engineering work

504
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,800
 and the study done through the peak rail study and we were able to utilize that

505
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,960
 engineering work in order to put in a Christie grant that was you know close

506
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,800
 to shove that shovel ready so it's a great return on your investment for peak

507
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,280
 rail that we were able to secure over 90 million dollars investment that is a

508
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,520
 safety feature that is needed today whether or not we ever put a passenger

509
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,120
 on it so it's a little bit of a misnomer when you look at the cost that we're

510
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:07,160
 kind of bearing the full cost of needing a basic safety feature that we should

511
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:13,880
 all want to have on there today for freight operations thank you director

512
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:25,360
 Catlin thank you and I have I have a lot of questions the I met five years ago

513
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:31,160
 along with our engineering staff down in Fort Worth with the BNSF and at that

514
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:39,720
 time and to director O'Keefe's point with the railroads it's a moving target and

515
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:46,480
 have they reviewed these costs independently that's question number one

516
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:53,240
 so they've seen our presentation they haven't done a verification process but

517
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:01,200
 they also agree directionally with where we've been on our cost I think that they

518
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,200
 would say is you know through negotiations if we were willing to agree

519
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,640
 with a lower frequency for starting that the cost could actually probably go

520
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:16,440
 further down than where we are today but that is for negotiations with them you

521
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,880
 brought up a good point I just know that when we when we were talking about the

522
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,040
 peak rail study we had to pay the railroad for them to do the cross

523
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:36,880
 estimate and so I just wanted the board to be aware of that the next thing when

524
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,680
 you talk about increased frequencies and I remember that was a sticking point

525
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,320
 during those preliminary discussions there has to be a ceiling I mean they're

526
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,520
 beyond which their operations couldn't support additional frequencies and has

527
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,320
 that been discussed or called out

528
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:01,160
 I think that there's a ceiling before you get to having to double track

529
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:06,160
 significant mileage is maybe what you're asking and I think this is included in

530
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,680
 the full build out for Front Range passenger rails alternative analysis that

531
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:17,280
 kind of goes through based off of the RTC modeling done for them when you trigger

532
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,320
 additional sightings or double tracking needed so that is in the service

533
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:28,280
 development plan for Front Range passenger rail and it's based off of BNSF's

534
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,800
 business data both for operations today and their forecasted operations for the

535
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:41,200
 future so this was something that was a new process really came out of you know

536
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,520
 kind of the missteps of California high-speed rail of not really having

537
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,680
 this modeling done on the front end and also not having the business case for

538
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,440
 rail operations done on the front end and really just waiting for a NEPA

539
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,680
 process before you get to any of those processes so when IJ passed they

540
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,720
 created this new process for these service development plans that is a

541
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,080
 federal document that goes through each step of this that Front Range passenger

542
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,080
 rail is currently doing and we're actually the first rail project in the

543
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,400
 country that is this far ahead with it and so there was a period of time where

544
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,640
 we were stalled a little bit because we were the first to enter into NDA's with

545
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:28,320
 the class 1 railroads to get their business data in to inform our RTC

546
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:36,360
 modeling and that is now we have the the NDA is done the RTC modeling is

547
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,720
 undergoing for all those increased frequencies and RTC model then tells you

548
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,880
 what all the infrastructure improvements are based off of those

549
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,800
 frequencies. Well good I want to say that they're usually pretty stingy with their

550
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,120
 data so could you offer for getting that took a while you brought something else

551
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:00,960
 up and that's the NEPA process and pardon me I'm dusting off the cobwebs

552
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:11,640
 from years ago but there's a process for approving fixed rail in through the Dr.

553
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:20,400
 Cobb process I think it's called Senate bill 208 is that right okay and are we

554
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:28,640
 going to be needing to go through that process for this as well even though the

555
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,600
 project limits extend beyond the Dr. Cobb region? You know it's a good

556
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,280
 question that I don't have a complete resolution on we have had conversations

557
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:44,600
 with Dr. Cobb leadership on this and they aren't clear either if this project

558
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,680
 would be subject to it I believe Northwest rail has already been approved

559
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,960
 by them and is there underlying as part of fast tracks it was right and so it's

560
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,840
 unclear because this is you know a slight modification and it extends beyond their

561
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,800
 borders so it is an outstanding question I have into the Attorney General's office

562
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,960
 on it and you know maybe we need some cleanup legislation to clarify that too

563
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:26,320
 it just needs some clarity on it I think yep but thank you all for your hard

564
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,600
 work I'm sure we'll have more questions as time goes on but I appreciate it thank

565
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,360
 you. Thank You director Catlin I have three directors in the queue I have

566
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:43,080
 secretary Nicholson next thank you very much chair bouquet I actually have a

567
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:49,960
 question for staff before I ask questions of our lovely guests and the

568
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,760
 first the question is I know there's a provision either in the RTD Act or in

569
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,360
 our bylaws that requires a super majority of the board to approve any new

570
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:08,600
 rail projects is my understanding so would this require the the eventual

571
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:14,320
 agreement would that require ten votes from us or would it only require eight

572
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:22,000
 votes from us? Miss Johnson yes thank you very much secretary Nicholson for the

573
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,120
 question I believe general counsel Snyder issued an opinion on that

574
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:31,400
 previously and so we will recirculate that document thank you okay appreciate

575
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:38,280
 that the second so now switching over to our wonderful guests I have two

576
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:44,080
 questions the first one given that this service doesn't happen without RTD's

577
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:51,240
 substantial financial contribution why shouldn't we get a veto over any JSEOC

578
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:56,040
 decision if you eventually need to get our approval and our money to make this

579
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:03,960
 happen well I think you essentially do because it still has to originate from

580
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:11,600
 you appropriating monies or entering into any contract that RTD would enter

581
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:18,040
 into what the Joint Executive Committee would do would be kind of the day-to-day

582
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:26,840
 manager of the negotiations with BNSF or any day-to-day management of a selected

583
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:33,880
 operator but you know any major decision that impacted the ability to actually

584
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:41,720
 implement the project would still have to be decided upon by the RTD board

585
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:48,400
 thanks yeah to be clear I was talking about the veto by our person on the JSEOC

586
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:54,840
 over a decision by the JSEOC because again without our 40 million a year or

587
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:00,080
 whatever it ends up being you guys the train doesn't happen was essentially my

588
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:05,600
 question and I guess I'll just leave that out there second question forgive me

589
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,600
 for this there's an internet meme about a relationship between a man and a woman

590
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,960
 in a relationship about to be intimate and the caption reads aren't you

591
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,580
 forgetting someone with a picture of Jesus off to the side I mentioned this

592
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:22,320
 because reading over the timeline there's a lot of mentions of RTD and CTIO

593
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,000
 and the governor but it seems like there's no time built in after the

594
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,840
 finalization of the financial plan to go to the public and ask the voters and

595
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,200
 talk to the voters and present to the voters about what we're doing what it

596
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,680
 costs and why we should do it in the first place so my question to you is

597
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,400
 basically why shouldn't we bake in time to do a real road show of this project

598
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,880
 why shouldn't the governor go to places and present on this train that he wants

599
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:56,040
 why shouldn't we go and present on these things before we take a massive history

600
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:03,160
 defining vote on this item and allocate hundreds of millions of dollars of the

601
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,240
 public's money it seems like you don't want that to happen or you would have

602
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,560
 put time for it in the schedule and I'm curious whether I'm reading that

603
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,800
 correctly thanks yeah I would say that throughout this whole process we are

604
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:24,160
 doing significant public engagement I know I personally do you know a lot of

605
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,720
 presentations to a lot of different community members so presenting to city

606
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:36,840
 councils along the corridor the general public so there is inherently baked into

607
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,600
 the project a lot of community engagement it's just not enumerated in

608
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,880
 these slides these slides were more of an overview of what the project is but I

609
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:50,560
 would also say that you know clearly the public has voted in fast-tracks in '04

610
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:55,880
 they voted when they elected their representatives in the General Assembly

611
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:02,640
 that passed these bills and there is inherent built into this community

612
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,640
 engagement that we just didn't add to the slides but we certainly can give you a

613
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,720
 report on all of the public engagement to date it's actually a pretty long

614
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,560
 section in the March 1st report on all the community engagement that

615
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,840
 happened in the lead up to the March 1st report I would anticipate we would have

616
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,360
 a similar one in the June report yeah and actually there was one in the 30

617
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,520
 September as well so all the reports that we've put out and the one that we

618
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:37,280
 would is coming contain lists of who we've talked to and generally speaking

619
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:44,500
 in in what venues secretary just very quickly I mean I'm a pretty engaged guy

620
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:50,080
 in Denver in in central Denver have you guys done any presentations public

621
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,360
 presentations in my district have you done any kind of you know when we've

622
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,600
 done big changes when we talked about BRT we do big Roadhouse presentations we

623
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,560
 bring the public in you know it's in the news it's on our website I read the post

624
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,680
 practically every day most of my friends do I go on reddit on a regular basis

625
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,600
 answer questions there I haven't seen you guys on there I haven't seen

626
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,080
 literally any big public events about this project explaining it to people

627
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,800
 I've seen one article about hey this is coming the trains coming sooner than you

628
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,240
 expected it would that's all anybody in my district knows about this at this

629
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,280
 point and I'll just be honest I don't see myself even if I like the project I

630
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,880
 don't see myself voting for it unless I think that you guys your boss has done

631
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,560
 the work necessary to sell this to the public and to sell this to the people

632
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,280
 who are here now not necessarily the people who are here when I wasn't

633
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:53,680
 legally able to drink thanks Thank You secretary director Geisinger thank you

634
01:04:53,680 --> 01:05:00,600
 and thank you both for all your work and and all the team I agree with director

635
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,920
 Buzwick this is the way to get to get this service done and this starter

636
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:11,280
 service I have a couple questions you mentioned that 42 million would be

637
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:18,200
 coming from the state does how does that come is it is the the 230 money come out

638
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:26,240
 of CTE and how much is that and the CTIO then put in I mean is that a is that a

639
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,920
 total of several different contributions from those different groups yeah that is

640
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,680
 a total of several different contributions and so I think it would be

641
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:43,160
 a mixture of CTIO investing in the projects that the construction projects

642
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,040
 that they would invest in finance and probably oversee the execution of same

643
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:53,440
 thing for CTE and then the you know in the March 1st report we weren't sure if

644
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,880
 the Chrissy Grant projects would get done because they were under review of

645
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,120
 the new administration that has since been greenlighted by the new

646
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,480
 administration and so that would probably be a new contribution that would

647
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:14,160
 be reflected in the mixture of contributions and those monies came from

648
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:23,440
 the governor's IJ cash fund to match the federal funds good thanks and just one

649
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:30,240
 other comment which is that I think this happened in in one of the statues 161

650
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:40,040
 161 yeah but I think that joint service talking about being Northwest Rail is

651
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:45,960
 confusing and maybe it's better to maybe the language is important that it's

652
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:53,000
 service on the Northwest Corridor to sort of pull apart Northwest Rail was

653
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 defined in you know fast tracks project and so it's just a thought and maybe

654
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,120
 something we can we can talk about after we see the IGA and all of that thank you

655
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,360
 very much Diane did you have something there you look like you were going to

656
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:18,000
 respond I was just gonna say that the statute uses Northwest fixed guideway

657
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,320
 thank you director guys here director Risha

658
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:35,200
 thank you mr. chair so as usual director Catlin got to a question before I did

659
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:43,880
 and I I just wanted to offer that I had up until this moment always assumed that

660
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:50,320
 dr. Krog would need to be involved because of just a plain language reading

661
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:57,320
 of statute so I would also add that if we need to clarify that we should do that

662
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:09,080
 as soon as practicable which would be next session but I I also I feel like I

663
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:19,360
 owed the you and my colleagues that just honesty that my district best tracks is

664
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:26,000
 not something I hear about in my district nor is this project I've been on the

665
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,800
 board for two and a half years and I think I have been asked about it less

666
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:38,640
 than ten times and half of them were from reporters to be to be honest and so

667
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,680
 I have some concern that proponents of the project aren't doing the necessary

668
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:56,480
 work in my district which is very active in local matters to get their buy-in and

669
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:05,760
 even if we move forward without FRPR having statutory authority to tax

670
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,920
 because it was granted by the voters or you know we have some sort of

671
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:17,720
 alternative method at the end of the day we are going to be held responsible by

672
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,480
 the larger public and it's really crucial to ensure that we have their

673
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:27,920
 buy-in so the feedback I gave was anecdotal that's just my experience but

674
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:39,520
 I I I would I would feel irresponsible if I if I didn't put that out there because

675
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,200
 it really does worry me that we might be getting married without a prenup or

676
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:52,680
 we're moving too quickly but we don't have public buy-in so just like in other

677
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:59,880
 parts of RTD where the fact that this these projects were not finished creates

678
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:08,760
 distrust we have to remember that not all parts of the district or the greater

679
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:15,000
 region share that sentiment and we just need to be careful and how we move

680
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,080
 forward because at the end of the day no matter what happens in this board room

681
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:24,240
 or the state level or the executive level we are ultimately going to respond

682
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:34,920
 to the taxpayers I I would like to see this project and all rail projects get

683
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:45,240
 built out I don't like cars and I don't like concrete jungles I I have concerns

684
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:51,560
 about the fiscal aspect that I think first vice jiro Keith summed up much

685
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:58,240
 more eloquently than I could but I would like to think it's possible so I'm

686
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:03,360
 looking for a reason to say yes and I just need a little bit more to get there

687
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:13,880
 and that's a bit painful to say in a public meeting with my colleagues but

688
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:18,320
 at this juncture it doesn't do any of us any good if we are not forthright in

689
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:25,040
 where we are so thank you for for letting me speak and that concludes my

690
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:31,800
 comments thank you director Risha I have director Guzman next thank you mr.

691
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:37,800
 chair I have to second first vice chair O'Keefe there's absolutely no way I

692
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,640
 would vote for this if we're gonna just completely empty out what everybody

693
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,800
 perceives to be the big piggy bank the price account that 190 million is not

694
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,200
 just for rail as has been purported and reported and rereported incorrectly there

695
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,720
 were caveats with that money for how it was to be used in conjunction with the

696
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,480
 fast-tracks plans and I think that we need to go back to the legislation and

697
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,080
 look at that also the five second was created after the point zero four percent

698
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,640
 sales and use tax was collected and there are additional monies that are in

699
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:11,560
 there that are also not directly linked to that legislation and so untangling

700
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,120
 that could be a big mess but also we need to be responsible with it as is our

701
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:21,240
 fiduciary duty it does support service services along the Northwest Corridor

702
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:27,720
 not just the fixed rail but also other other bus services and connections that

703
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:33,060
 were part of the anticipated cost of moving people around and it supports the

704
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:37,520
 maintenance and the transit asset management along that rail and so one

705
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,840
 thing that I have not heard come out of these conversations that is going to be

706
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,720
 it's going to keep me on the no side until I understand it in terms of an IGA

707
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,240
 is how we are going to plan the trusset transit asset management piece of this

708
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,540
 how are we going to do maintenance and repair work because the cost of a shiny

709
01:12:54,540 --> 01:13:00,480
 new thing is one thing but maintaining it to continue good usage and safety for

710
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,240
 the public is a completely different matter and we have just spent the last

711
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,800
 two summers I'm gonna include the current one we're walking into now doing

712
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,000
 exactly that work because it was forgotten for more than 20 years and it

713
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,600
 cannot happen with this project so if money is not set aside or anticipated

714
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,040
 with all the glory of putting a brand new shiny train on a track to get people

715
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:29,920
 moving and continue to maintain that asset by all members of the IGA

716
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,600
 absolutely not there's no way we can continue forward with the conversation

717
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,200
 it's not even worth having so if that money is not accounted for somewhere in

718
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,480
 the finance planning of doing this there's no way we would do it and why do

719
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,000
 I say that because safety has to come first human lives are at risk and a

720
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,560
 danger so as you spoke to the positive train control and all of the other

721
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:54,040
 necessary infrastructure to do this maintenance of these tracks and these

722
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:58,000
 conveyances are going to be equally important and should not be put to the

723
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
 side in a rush to get a train on a track that's not how we do things and that's

724
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,640
 not how we should do things in my opinion so that's one part sorry my

725
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,220
 comment the other thing is we I have a big concern about cannibalizing our

726
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:18,000
 regular service when the language that you put on the screen earlier says we

727
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,680
 will I believe it was will strive to implement the joint service plan that

728
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:31,120
 will not render infeasible the existing operations of RTD from or for from or

729
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:37,400
 the future plans for FRPRD we are running an active transit agency we have

730
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,800
 services going we collect a sales and use tax of a total of 1% 0.1% but it's

731
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,800
 divided in how we use it with funds being restricted to certain aspects of

732
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,240
 it that is where we have to consider how we are going to as a body put money into

733
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:56,640
 this and where it's going to come from but the backstop question is super

734
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,520
 important because the backstop if it falls to us to fix the matters that are

735
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:07,360
 overrun on finances can literally cut bus service jobs and take away the things

736
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:13,520
 that we are currently providing and that would not be fair for a three round trip

737
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,600
 a day service to one particular area of the region because it doesn't take into

738
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:23,880
 consideration everybody's need to move around our entire region that's all I

739
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:32,800
 have thank you thank you director Guzman director Harwick I have a like a few

740
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,960
 questions and thoughts but the first question is you reference 83 million for

741
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,320
 the first year of operations 32 for operations maintenance 51 in debt service

742
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:47,880
 with that 51 million in mind what is the amount of debt I just if you could

743
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:52,880
 remind me what's the amount of debt that you anticipate taking on

744
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:59,160
 so the March 1st report is that study so it's looking at how much would it cost

745
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:06,680
 in current borrowing to finance the full 885 and that's where you get a debt

746
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:14,120
 payment number of 51 million dollars annually to finance the full 885 in

747
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:19,400
 regards to director Guzman's comments I think it's also important to remember in

748
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:25,960
 the March 1st report that when you look at the full horizon of the project there

749
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:30,480
 is baked into the underlying cost assumption the state of good repair and

750
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:37,080
 safety ongoing cost and so you probably don't remember the bars from the last

751
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:41,280
 presentation but it's in there in those outer years when you have to start

752
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,000
 replacing and doing the state of good repair work and what was important about

753
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,480
 the March 1st report is really looking at not just is there enough existing

754
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:56,160
 revenue today but is there enough existing revenue to through 2050 and so

755
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:01,920
 the report that Ernst & Young created for us was to look at all of the revenue

756
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,200
 sources and to look at their growth trajectory to make sure that they also

757
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:11,000
 track with the growth trajectory of the state of good repair and escalating

758
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,960
 costs for the service and so in that March 1st report that you all got it did

759
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:23,320
 do that work and you know where I showed you today that the daily rental car fee

760
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:29,760
 grows from 57 million dollars in 2026 and grows to 110 million dollars in 2050

761
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:35,280
 a similar number was in the March 1st presentation to you all of looking at

762
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,760
 your current revenue at 900 million dollars annually but that is projected to

763
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:46,520
 grow to over 2 billion dollars in 25 years for what RTD is currently

764
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:53,000
 projecting to collect in sales tax so that mapping of the escalating cost and

765
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,080
 state of good repair against the available revenue sources was

766
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:03,320
 cornerstone to the work in the March 1st report thank you director director

767
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:10,040
 Nicholson thank you excuse me thank you so I have a couple of questions that the

768
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:15,400
 first one and I promise slightly more fun question than my my last one what

769
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:20,480
 when we talk about three trains a day what kind of hours are we talking about

770
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,840
 here because I've heard lots of different sort of understandings of like

771
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,120
 what could I use this for and you know if you're running a train back from

772
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:34,480
 Denver to Boulder at 5 p.m. you know you can use that for a meeting in the middle

773
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,640
 of the day you can use that for 6 p.m. or 6 30 you can use that for commuting you

774
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,040
 can't use that to go to a Nuggets game for example and so maybe you can help me

775
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:51,040
 think about and help the public what kinds of travel is this gonna serve and

776
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,600
 what kinds of stuff because again it's only three trains a day is it gonna be

777
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,560
 outside of and also are we talking about three trains a day five seven days a

778
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,080
 week or only five days a week am I gonna be able to take this down to pride for

779
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,960
 example if we're running and do that or is it would it only be running weekday

780
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:13,720
 service thanks and then I'll have I have follow-ups so sure I don't know the

781
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:18,280
 schedule that was a part of the RTC modeling off the top of my head but we

782
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:24,340
 can certainly pull that and have that a part of the June presentation if you so

783
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:31,000
 desire but it was for seven days a week and it did adjust for weekend patterns

784
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:38,140
 versus weekday I just don't know the exact times off the top my head appreciate

785
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,360
 it yeah that would be super helpful because my when I've gotten good

786
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,120
 questions about this my constituents have asked what am I going to be able to

787
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:48,280
 use it for if I'm in Denver what am I able to do the same thing I'm bolder

788
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:54,800
 second question so we got a fairly sobering I think is the right word

789
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:00,400
 presentation from our asset management team at our training I'm a fellow

790
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,560
 relatively new director so we get a bunch of different meetings where they

791
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:09,240
 explain different stuff to us and part of that training was over just how

792
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:15,120
 freaking expensive it is to manage something like a fixed rail asset over

793
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,880
 the course of multiple decades and how you really have to think about these

794
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:23,800
 things not in terms of what it's gonna cost for five years or ten years but

795
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:29,880
 twenty thirty and then to replace all of it when we get there and hilariously

796
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,880
 enough in an article I think about sound transit to later that day I came across

797
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:39,720
 this wonderful quote but from Willie Brown who is the former speaker of the

798
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,240
 California State Assembly where I grew up in the former mayor of San Francisco

799
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:48,280
 in a candid admission of how the political world operates Willie Brown

800
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,440
 the former mayor of San Francisco once dismissed the cost overruns on a

801
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,200
 transportation hub intended for the bullet train in the world of civic

802
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:59,680
 projects the first budget is really just a down payment he wrote in a guest

803
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:04,800
 newspaper column in 2013 if people knew the real costs from the start nothing

804
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,720
 would ever get approved the idea is to get going start digging a hole and make

805
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:14,200
 it so big there's no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in

806
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:21,640
 isn't that what joint service starter service kind of is thank you I'm asking

807
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:29,020
 that as a question I mean no because we have a cost estimate through 2050 that

808
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:32,860
 was showed to you in the first presentation and map the revenue sources

809
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:40,640
 to the projected cost so I certainly wouldn't characterize it that way I'll

810
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:47,000
 just ask one quick follow-up is that's okay given the significant routine cost

811
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:53,040
 overruns as director O'Keeffe alluded to that for example high-speed rail in

812
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,840
 California has undergone where the project has turned out to be billions

813
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,840
 more expensive than it initially cost given that we see this in public

814
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:07,760
 projects everywhere what makes you confident as someone who has worked on

815
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,360
 these things and been in government for a long time what makes you confident

816
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:17,160
 that you're right this time when so often other people get this wrong I think

817
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,960
 the projects that we are looking at from a rail perspective is very different

818
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,560
 than high-speed rail I mean I don't even think it's like an apple to a pineapple

819
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:32,240
 because yeah it's it's not the same species really because what we are

820
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:38,160
 talking about is utilizing underutilized current infrastructure in the state of

821
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:43,720
 Colorado and what we have seen is an opportunity that exists right now that

822
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:47,700
 even is different than when fast tracks passed in 04 when fast tracks passed in

823
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:52,880
 04 there was a lot more free operations on this line than exists today the NSF

824
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,380
 has shifted a lot of their freight operations to the Greeley sub and out

825
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:02,080
 east and that has created this opportunity to utilize an existing

826
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,600
 infrastructure asset for a new purpose as we're no for it was in war and

827
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,560
 conflict with their freight operations than it is today same thing with

828
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:16,080
 mountain rail we have an opportunity to use an existing asset that is under

829
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,320
 utilized because of the coal plant closures and Craig and Hayden has

830
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:24,960
 created this capacity on the line the lines in good shape it's active today

831
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,880
 still moving coal but it's about to be inactive for half of the segment when

832
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:37,080
 those coal plants close in 29 and so it's really taking a sunk cost from an

833
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,460
 infrastructure perspective and repurposing it for a future need is how

834
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:45,360
 I would see these projects and I think what's different about the way we've

835
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,200
 approached this and that we've had success with with at least Union Pacific

836
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:55,120
 in the mountain rail access agreement is having an enumerated infrastructure list

837
01:23:55,120 --> 01:24:00,000
 that corresponds with the actual daily round trips so the way that access

838
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,280
 agreement reads is for these daily round trips three of them here's the actual

839
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:10,840
 infrastructure that is needed to empower that on this timeline and certainly if

840
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:16,040
 that infrastructure list is priced out 20 years from now the escalation cost is

841
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:20,320
 going to be different but we have plans to do those infrastructure projects this

842
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:26,160
 calendar year so we believe our cost estimates are good I don't think anything

843
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:31,540
 is ever bulletproof but I think that the benefit to the state of Colorado that we

844
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:38,200
 would get from these projects of taking cars off the road and driving better

845
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,840
 land use decisions where we have housing in fill to get to a smart growth

846
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,760
 strategy for the state of Colorado is worthy of the cause and I think we have

847
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:54,200
 paved a much different way than what California has done and certainly I

848
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:58,800
 think we are all students of having watched what California has done and

849
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:04,280
 paved a different way forward in Colorado that has as much certainty

850
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:09,720
 around it as you possibly can for a big public infrastructure project thank you

851
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:13,640
 I'm gonna go to director Peculary I saw his hand and I'll come back to you

852
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:19,360
 secretary thank you chair thank you guests for your presentation appreciate

853
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:24,200
 it I think I just want to start out by saying the front-range needs rail needs

854
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:28,320
 passenger rail service we have a growing population people moving here and

855
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,920
 bringing their cars we have increased poor air quality there's a lot of

856
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,520
 reasons why we need rail and there's so many reasons that in 2003 the people

857
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:41,960
 said we need rail and they asked for it and time and time again people have

858
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,360
 asked for it over and over again and the legislator even this year said once

859
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:51,340
 again we need rail RTD you have to build the rail that you promised to build back

860
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:54,440
 from the voters said you had to build rail so I'd like to keep to our

861
01:25:54,440 --> 01:26:00,720
 commitment towards at least doing what we can to finish fast tracks because we

862
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,880
 need rail but I do have a little bit of a few concerns and I think I'll just

863
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:10,520
 highlight one concern and a question first and then a concern I guess they're

864
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:17,520
 tied together but three strong trips per day is starter service it's useful

865
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,840
 transit for some but not as many as ten round trips or twelve I'd really like to

866
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:27,520
 see the movement towards double tracking so we can get those higher frequencies

867
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:32,200
 and make this a really useful transit service for the people along the front

868
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,640
 range in the front range district but with what we're building and what we're

869
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:42,440
 committing what this IGA first of all is just allowing something to go forward so

870
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:46,120
 we can get more information we're not committing any funds yet so I do hope

871
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:51,440
 you support the IGA but in the idea I would like to see some type of assurance

872
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,760
 that we can continue on the path towards that those ten twelve round trips per

873
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:01,120
 day or double tracking and if it's possible the legislators already given

874
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:06,400
 FRPRD and a revenue for collecting revenue I don't really see in the future

875
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,560
 of the state giving us a couple billion dollars to build double track front

876
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,600
 range passenger rail but the people could choose to do it so I would like I

877
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,240
 guess my question then to not lead a sorry about the leading question is if

878
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:26,040
 it would be possible to do put some assurances in that would require this

879
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:32,640
 new entity with IGA to pursue expanded service and not just stop at three

880
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:40,520
 trains per day thank you thanks yeah and I think that's important feedback as to

881
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:46,880
 what the board would like in the IGA and so we could certainly take that back

882
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:52,760
 thank you thank you director all right any further comments questions

883
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:58,160
 secretary and then director Guzman thank you two very quick things so first

884
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:04,120
 off I just want to make an important point I want this train I actually

885
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:09,480
 really really want this train I am one of a handful of people on the board who

886
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:14,000
 doesn't have a car getting to Boulder getting to Longmont this would be and I

887
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,500
 live like 10 minutes from Union Station this would be a massive improvement in

888
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,960
 my quality of life getting up to getting up the northwest and for exactly the

889
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:29,800
 reason that you alluded to miss Kaufman this is an opportunity to build a ton of

890
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,560
 new housing in a place that badly needs it make it easier for people to get to

891
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,160
 Denver there are lots of reasons in principle to like this project the same

892
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,720
 way that I like the idea of having a summer home in Bali or a winter home the

893
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:49,720
 question is can I afford it and can I make it can I make it work can I can do

894
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:53,800
 it as the access of me flying out there you know so really it just comes down to

895
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:59,040
 I'm putting you through the paces on this I'm running the traps I'm making this as

896
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:03,760
 difficult as I am because as someone who's been involved in government since

897
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:12,600
 I was 18 I am terrified genuinely freaked at you know have had mild panic

898
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:19,080
 attacks over this decision because I don't want to turn 50 or 55 or 60 and

899
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:24,920
 look back and say wow I signed on to a gigantic money pit on the other hand I

900
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,760
 don't want to look back and say wow I missed out on signing on to one of the

901
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:35,400
 best expansions of passenger rail that we were ever going to have so it doesn't

902
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,920
 come from a place of disliking the project it comes from a place of

903
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:45,720
 gigantic amounts of fear over the significance of this decision yeah I

904
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,840
 appreciate that I think it's really well found it given the history of this

905
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:54,520
 project and the way we've grown as a metro area and the needs that we have in

906
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:59,200
 a metro area for more transit and rail and the constraints that we have around

907
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,480
 revenue as a state and how we can gain new revenue as a state so I think all of

908
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:09,880
 that thoughtful approach is warranted which is partly why you know the step

909
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,720
 that we are contemplating now is can we all agree on how we would make joint

910
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:21,700
 decisions to then go negotiate with BNSF come back to the governing boards with

911
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:28,240
 the results of that and say is this ROI worth it and that would come after a

912
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:34,200
 successful negotiation that would enumerate the infrastructures that has

913
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:39,920
 to correspond with the access agreement for daily round trips and at that

914
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,680
 juncture I think you would have a big decision to be made and we would have a

915
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:48,640
 lot more information on we have verified the infrastructure list with BNSF we

916
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:56,140
 have you know the engineers price that out and then we have a financial model

917
01:30:56,140 --> 01:31:02,400
 on how it would work right so you know does it make sense for CTIO who has

918
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:08,920
 bonding capacity to finance all of PTC that would be enumerated in the finance

919
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:16,800
 plan like how which piece of which puzzle would look at the finance plan

920
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:22,360
 based off of that infrastructure list obviously RTD would need to look at just

921
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:27,280
 infrastructure costs within the RTD region not outside of it so you know I

922
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,320
 think we're you know attempting to eat an elephant we have to do it chunk by

923
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:36,180
 chunk here and it's really getting to a place where we all agree on how we're

924
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:42,320
 gonna operate together to collaborate to get to an access agreement and then once

925
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:47,000
 we have an access agreement how do we create a finance plan based off of that

926
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,640
 agreement and then you all will have a big decision to be made on the ROI of

927
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:58,800
 that investment we just can't get there without having those negotiations first

928
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:04,680
 thank you based on the sake of time I'm gonna have treasure banker and then

929
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:11,120
 director Guzman as our final two thank you you know one of the things we

930
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:15,240
 haven't really talked about and I was hoping that we could get to it in in our

931
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:20,840
 executive session but time is going by fast well we can extend also and start

932
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:26,400
 our board meeting lead teams I've been trying to meet with as many of our board

933
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,520
 directors as possible and I'm hoping to meet with everybody I've been working I

934
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,360
 think you all know I've been working on these numbers for a long time but last

935
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,200
 year the state legislature gave us two new revenue sources so when we're

936
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:45,560
 talking about oh my this project looks first of all cost estimates we're

937
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:50,960
 getting right now are very reasonable much less than what they were even a

938
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,760
 couple of years ago but we now have some new revenue sources out there and

939
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,120
 actually I was hoping Lisa wasn't going to hear me do something some of this but

940
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:04,520
 if you go in and you take a look at the two new bills that were passed last year

941
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,400
 and the different pots of money that they put the money in we have or the

942
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:15,720
 state has a hundred and seventy four million dollars a year of new money that

943
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:22,500
 we need to ask for and write a grant for so if you're talking about RTD money

944
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:29,600
 this could be RTD money sorry Lisa but this is where we need to talk with the

945
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:35,220
 state we need to do some negotiation and when we're talking about how it's going

946
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:40,960
 to hurt our budget this is all new this is all new money a hundred and seventy

947
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,200
 four million dollars the state legislature gave us last year for

948
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:52,520
 transit now is it all RTD no probably not chunk of it could be a big chunk of

949
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:57,920
 that could be and this is where I was hoping as a board that we could talk

950
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:05,600
 about this because again it's we can debate Pfizer and we will we should and

951
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:11,680
 there's a lot of things that we can talk about with Pfizer but there's so much

952
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:18,280
 new money on the table there's so much opportunity and we've got some great

953
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:23,240
 partners here to make it happen and so if we do go into special session you know

954
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:31,560
 go ahead and pass out my my last Excel spreadsheet here I keep making tweaks to

955
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:37,320
 it I will continue to do it but I guess I just didn't want the board to think

956
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:44,600
 that it's going to be coming mostly or coming out of our base budget because it

957
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,320
 doesn't have to it could come out of the new money that the state legislature has

958
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:55,040
 opened up for us so the treasurer can I say one thing on that is it's also not

959
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:59,080
 just the last two bills that passed and actually if you go back and you look at

960
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:05,160
 Senate bill 260 that passed in 2021 one of the things that we created and that

961
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:12,520
 was the new day was the new delivery fee and the delivery fee was created in

962
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:17,520
 order to help public agencies that need to reflate to low to zero emissions and

963
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,360
 it created around 60 million dollars in the first five years so it's that 29

964
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:28,400
 cents that shows up on your Amazon bill every time you get Amazon and that you

965
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:34,280
 know we would love to partner with RTD on their refleeting strategy obviously

966
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:40,520
 refleeting for air quality improvements is a big priority for us and so it's not

967
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,320
 just on these rail projects do we want to be a collaborative funding partner

968
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:49,120
 it's really on all the needs that RTD has as we try to reach our mutual goals

969
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:54,120
 around expanding transit and rail service for the metro area and so not

970
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:58,840
 just the rail projects is important for you to hear me say there's all sorts of

971
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:03,000
 money that we have created to partner with RTD on that we want to partner with

972
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,200
 RTD on and really think about how we maximize public financing tools that we

973
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:11,880
 have at the state in order to get to our broader vision of a smart growth

974
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:17,960
 strategy for the state of Colorado thank you director Guzman thank you mr. chair

975
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:23,400
 I also want to see this project get done I voted for it when it was first in

976
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:28,120
 front of me on a ballot when I was early voting as a young child right like let's

977
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:37,560
 be real okay well yeah okay it feels a long time ago now so I get the

978
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:43,680
 frustration of all of my long monsters who have been emailing me lovingly about

979
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:47,000
 trying to approve something that we're actually not making a decision on right

980
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,400
 now but I do understand the frustration and consternation and I don't want to be

981
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,440
 burnt in effigy and Longmont by anybody okay I represent Denver and my concern

982
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,520
 as a director needs to be to my sub-district first and then to the

983
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:04,600
 benefit of the entire region I appreciate the outreach for partnership

984
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:08,560
 from the state that's the first time I've heard it given to us that way and

985
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,280
 explained to us that way and I would like to do that partnership as well but I am

986
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,160
 hesitant to reach my hand out in return when every time I turn around I'm

987
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:21,360
 attacked or the board is attacked or the agency is attacked by the state and so

988
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:25,480
 from me to the administration of our state right now I would really

989
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:29,400
 appreciate it if you guys would work with us so that we can have a better

990
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:33,640
 relationship because right now I am once bitten and twice shy which puts me in a

991
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:40,440
 defensive mode over my agency as is my fiduciary duty of loyalty my question

992
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:44,000
 though is for our missing partner who is not I believe represented here but when

993
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,880
 is FRPRD gonna get there taxing situation in order and go to the

994
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,640
 voters because we can do a lot within the regional transportation district

995
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:57,240
 geography beyond that I wouldn't vote to commit any money outside of it and I

996
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,800
 don't believe we are legally allowed to do so there was some change in the law

997
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,440
 but I still didn't understand whether that allowed us to do that or not and so

998
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:10,080
 just a final question that can come back later in the report next month what's

999
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,560
 going on with our partner that is absent at this point because their funding has

1000
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,840
 come from the state and not from their own resources thanks yeah it's a great

1001
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:25,000
 question and it's partly why we have kind of jumped into the fray to start

1002
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,680
 trying to figure out how to create this collaborative approach to funding these

1003
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,520
 projects and and again why I think it's important for you to hear me say it's

1004
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:38,560
 not just about funding Northwest rails commitment to the voters but it's about

1005
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,700
 completion of all the unfinished fast-tracks projects because we have

1006
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:46,600
 pulled multiple times front-range passenger rail and it is not currently

1007
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:51,520
 viable at the ballot because of the voters skepticism that they we all

1008
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,200
 collectively could be trusted with a new revenue source to do a rail project

1009
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:02,240
 because of the hangover of fast-tracks and so you know it's a big barrier to

1010
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:08,520
 going back to the voters and asking for increased resources is that they don't

1011
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,840
 have an answer to this outstanding problem and so I think it's incumbent on

1012
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:19,920
 everyone who is trying to provide the best transit service and expand its

1013
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:25,080
 service for Colorado to try to see how we problem-solve around that because

1014
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:31,720
 it's not just FRPR that is suffering from it it will be the case if RTD needs

1015
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:36,400
 to go back to the voters for new transit money it will be the case if there's new

1016
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:42,600
 RTAs in the metro area that would like to stand up service is that this is a big

1017
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:51,800
 barrier to voters approving any additional resources. Thank you. Director

1018
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:59,880
 Arisha. Thank You Mr. Chair um I my ears perked up when I heard polling and I

1019
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:05,000
 have not seen the polling that was just referenced and so I was wondering if if

1020
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,020
 that's something that's available or it could be shared um I think that would be

1021
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:15,680
 helpful for the board thank you thank you sure I'm happy to share the slide

1022
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:19,480
 deck that I did to Colorado rails meeting a couple weekends ago that has

1023
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:27,040
 some of those pertinent slides in it well miss Barrett miss Kaufman do you

1024
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:31,600
 want to greatly appreciate you for your time thank you directors for comments

1025
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,520
 and questions we're looking forward to our June report and hopefully the

1026
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:41,720
 feedback and questions that were presented this evening will be helpful

1027
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:46,680
 going forward so I want to thank you both thank you

1028
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,880
 all right in a moment the board will meet an executive session regarding a

1029
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,280
 proposed intergovernmental agreement related to joint service for the

1030
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:04,320
 Northwest rail corridor I'd like to amend the emotion to move into executive

1031
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:08,280
 session to state that the special board meeting will be during deemed adjourned

1032
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:12,400
 after it adjourns into the executive session for public transparency this

1033
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:16,080
 means that once the board moves into executive session the main meeting will

1034
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,640
 be adjourned for anyone who might be in the room or remote the regular scheduled

1035
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:26,260
 board meeting will occur after this meeting with the anticipated start time

1036
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:34,640
 of I'm gonna say 630 it might be a little bit longer but anticipated start

1037
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:41,040
 time of 630 so please know that we'll be back then I'll now entertain a motion to

1038

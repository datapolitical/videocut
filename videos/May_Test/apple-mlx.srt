00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,140
Twelve present and three absent.

31
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,319
We do have a quorum.

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,560
Please note that the special board meeting does have a section for public comment.

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,840
This afternoon.

34
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,260
However, the public can still offer comments.

35
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,799
Excusing.

36
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,540
Does not have a section for public comment this afternoon.

37
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,719
However, the public can still offer comments.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
The email or by participating in person or remotely.

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,840
During the regular schedule meeting, which will be happening later this evening.

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,719
Either at 530 or potentially a little bit later, depending how long.

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,480
Our special board meeting happens this afternoon.

42
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,239
All right.

43
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,780
So we have our external entities report and this external entities report will be coming from the joint rail service update.

44
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,900
For today's special board meeting, we have just the one.

45
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:59,859
And today's special guest is going to be Diane Barrett, special advisor to the governor for joint rail service.

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,219
Before I ask Miss Barrett to begin, I would want to offer the floor to GM CEO Johnson for some opening remarks.

47
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,219
Miss Johnson, the floor is yours.

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,580
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Good afternoon to all board members as thimpled in those members of the public.

49
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,780
Before we get started, just for a point of clarification, I do know that Lisa Kaufman is present as well.

50
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,300
Senior advisor to the governor who will be part of the presentation this afternoon.

51
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,340
I also like to acknowledge myself more touch and send our deputy general counsel who is sitting in today as general counsel.

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,060
And then more specifically, we have in the audience our chief financial officer.

53
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,639
Kelly Mackie, who all formally introduced during the course of the public board meeting.

54
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:48,639
But for the matter at hand today, as relates to the progress relative to joint service and working with five other entities aside from of course ourselves with RTD.

55
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:58,580
And coming forward with options relative to bringing passenger rail service to the front range more specifically along the northwest corridor.

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:07,800
We have been involved in meetings and working diligently and our colleagues from the state are here to provide an overview.

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:16,680
With that as a backdrop, there'll be an opportunity whereby this body will go into executive session and we can have a more in-depth discussion pertinent to.

58
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,039
Next steps. So with that, Mr. Chair, I would ask Ms. Parrott and Ms. Kaufman to join.

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,099
Set the you take shape, but you shape table for their presentation this afternoon. Thank you.

60
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,479
All right, Ms. Parrott and Ms. Kaufman, thank you for joining us. Floor is yours.

61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,039
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,740
Thank you, gentlemen.

63
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,580
I'm a manager, Johnson, for that introduction.

64
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,520
This is my fourth appearance, actually.

65
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,639
With you folks. So I hope that you're not getting bored with us.

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:25,579
Lisa's going to start us off and we'll go through an overview of where we are and what we've been doing.

67
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:34,180
And then we'll have a quick overview of the IGA, which you've all been looking at thinking about for a while.

68
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,060
And then that'll be it.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,079
And questions.

70
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:43,240
Great. Thanks, Dan.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:52,939
So I'll get an overview on where we've been to date and what the overall timeline for the project is.

72
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:56,560
So some background is.

73
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:01,680
SB 184 was signed into law May of 2024.

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:18,259
And in this new law, it created a new congestion fee of $3 a day on daily rental cars, which is estimated to bring in a new $57 million and FY26 before growing to over $110 million by 2050.

75
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:35,459
And in that law, it directed RTD front range passenger rail and sea dot and to collaborate to deliver on starter service for inner city passenger rail from Denver to Fort Collins by January 2029.

76
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:48,240
It allowed the entities to contemplate three different ways to govern this collaborative to deliver passenger rail through either an IGA or a new call.

77
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,420
And we've been working on a real authority or an all together new legal authority.

78
00:05:53,399 --> 00:06:07,439
And what the principles kind of rallied around early on was the concept of an IGA given that all the existing entities had the legal authority they needed to govern the service and enter into the service through an IGA.

79
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:30,199
I would say that some previous board members from RTD during the process of this legislation were advocates for the new Colorado rail authority as a potential solution and that idea still has some merit but the legislation did not create an appropriation to do a proper study on that concept.

80
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:42,740
So early on that concept was really only given a cursory look as it's a complicated endeavor that would have needed in appropriation to do a full analysis on that concept.

81
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:55,819
So it's just worth noting it's not that the principles decided that concept was without merit it just was something that would have needed far more resources to really explore that as a viable governance option.

82
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,819
Also in last year's legislative session.

83
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,279
SP to 30 pass which is a new production fee on oil and gas extraction.

84
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,420
This law is forecasted in its first full year to bring in around $110 million.

85
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:24,360
The lion share benefit share will likely be RTD as 70% of it is to go out to local transit agencies for increasing.

86
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:41,839
Service and ridership that is to go out for mellically 70% of it and then there is a 20% set aside for passenger rail that calls out prioritization for completion of the Northwest Rail and the end line.

87
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,399
This is a project overview for the work around joint service.

88
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,860
So as I just went through May 2024 SP 184 and SP 230 was signed into law.

89
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:08,240
In August of 2024 the principles of joint service met so general managers from RTD FRPRD.

90
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,459
Director Lou and the governor and decided to bring on the ever talented Diane Barrett.

91
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:22,160
To help lead this project and lead the interagency coordination.

92
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:37,820
You know part of the reason why the principles decided to bring on Diane is that one of the most successful collaborative that the state of Colorado has seen was the renovation and revitalization of union station.

93
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:45,460
And which required a lot of coordination among many different public entities to come together to come up with the creative financing.

94
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:53,259
Mechanism to get that done and Diane led that project for then mayor Hicken Luber as the first cheap project officer.

95
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:05,899
And so we're very blessed for her to come out of retirement to come lead this and do it again because it is a herkulean effort to coordinate this many public entities with their own policies by laws.

96
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:23,259
And enabling legislation and so there really is truly no one better to do this work than Diane which then led to the March 1 report that had an initial cost estimate in review of available revenue streams and review of governance models.

97
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:38,899
And so we'll review a little bit of what the March 1 report said but in you know succinctly it said that there is enough existing resources and that an IGA is the preferred governance model to deliver joint service.

98
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:54,279
We have since spent the time since March 1 refining the study and looking at updating the cost estimates based off of the feedback from the March 1 report based off of additional feedback from BNSF.

99
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:01,240
And drafting the IGA and doing workshops like we are here today with the governing boards.

100
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:10,240
So the drafting of the IGA has been led by Diane but also the general councils from RTD FRPRD and the attorney general's office.

101
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:33,700
And we have now done workshops including today with all the governing boards we expect that feedback from all of the workshops and the ongoing drafting will continue until about mid June in which we hope to be able to circulate a final draft in mid June for four deductions this summer in June, July.

102
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:50,480
So this is a project timeline moving forward and kind of gets at the heart of what is the IGA about but final steps as I said is to circulate a final draft of the IGA in June.

103
00:10:50,480 --> 00:11:16,259
And then start operating under the governance of the IGA to speak with one voice and negotiations with BNSF with the hope of getting an access agreement with BNSF and be able to then have a finance model based off of the actual cost based off of the actual infrastructure list negotiated with BNSF.

104
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:42,000
And that at that point we would then be asking for boards to adopt financial plans based off of the actual negotiations with BNSF and that that would then kick off kind of the procurement for operator and executing a financing any need buzz that are needed construction and safety testing with the commencement of service in January, 2029.

105
00:11:43,240 --> 00:12:01,620
When I would say about this is I was just the state chief negotiator for the University of the Access Agreement for Mountain Rail, which was a good learning experience to understand how those documents answer a lot of the questions that I'm sure you all have.

106
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:10,460
How is the infrastructure cost associated with this determined what's the timeline who does the where cows it.

107
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:19,460
Going to proceed and so that access agreement is foundational to any project for passenger rail.

108
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:31,399
And what we have heard loud and clear from BNSF is that the need for joint services because right now absent having an IGA.

109
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:43,120
And so that's the way this is we're going to deliver passenger rail on the northern sub collaboratively there is multiple different public agencies that are planning passenger rail projects on the northern sub that they own.

110
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:56,539
From from Denver Union station to Fort Collins and that if those projects were to proceed in a silo that adds a level of complexity and conflict with trade operations that would have.

111
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:59,580
A cost estimate impact to all projects.

112
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:22,519
So to put that more succinctly if front range passenger rail were to price out their project right now BNSF would assume the infrastructure needs for Northwest rail in addition to front range passenger rail which would balloon the costs for front range passenger rail as there are multiple passenger rail systems planned.

113
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:35,519
And so the interagency agreement is designed to really say that the public agencies are going to work together to get one access agreement and have one operator to create that.

114
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:50,539
Efficiency for both the taxpayer and fee payers that would be funding the service but also to reduce any conflict with freight operations both from a safety perspective but also from a freight business perspective.

115
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:59,980
And so the goal of the IGA is to say this is how we will work together here's the core principles of the collaborative.

116
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:11,460
And be able to go speak with one voice in those negotiations with BNSF so that we can get the most cost efficient passenger rail system on the northern front range.

117
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,259
That I think I turn it over to Diane to go over key takeaways from the March 1 report.

118
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,700
Thank you Lisa.

119
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:43,360
From the March 1 report we've or by the time of the March 1 report we had learned that there are enough existing resources from the construction impact fee and the production fee.

120
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:57,539
In SB 184 and SB 230 and RTD sales stacks to cover the cost of three daily round trips remember that we were asked to look at three and five round trips.

121
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:16,259
Any appropriation made by any of the parties IE the agencies is subject to policy and decision budget decisions of the governing boards something for you all specifically to keep in mind.

122
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:28,139
General manager Johnson will be coming to you for your prior approval before any tax action is is taken.

123
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:42,600
Three daily round trips is estimated to cost 83 million dollars in the first year of operations 32 million of that is O and M plus 51 million in debt service.

124
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,480
We will be updating those numbers which are the same numbers you saw the last two times I was here I believe.

125
00:15:50,940 --> 00:16:04,919
We'll be updating those in the next coming weeks and in our June presentation to you we will have a very interesting new numbers to show you.

126
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:19,360
If the state contributes 42 million dollars annually from 230 and 184 numbers there is a gap of 41 million dollars to be filled by RTD.

127
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:41,820
The peak rail study that you folks did at great costs recently and by the way we are using data from that report constantly it's been a tremendous burn to joint service to have that study in place so you should be proud of that.

128
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:53,639
Anyway three trains from Denver to only to long mont is said to be 52 to 56 million dollars annually for you by yourselves.

129
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:08,500
So 41 million is significantly less than that and the service would be connecting twice the amount of population that would be going to Fort Collins rather than just too long.

130
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:20,559
Nearly all of the infrastructure investments for the joint service that we're planning would benefit the eventual front range passenger rail.

131
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:37,339
Further studies needed to define the service negotiate an access agreement with BNSF develop an internage agency agreement and importantly a financial plan that will work.

132
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:56,420
Why did we decide to do an internage agreement the remaining choice you heard from Lisa earlier was really establishing a new entity and new public entity.

133
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:03,680
That's what we did in Denver Union station and we did it there for various reasons.

134
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:14,099
It was kind of a first shot out of the box and we did it in Miss Catland sat on our original board.

135
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:23,700
So we did we did feel that after the fact probably could have done it with an IGA.

136
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,319
Okay, it was a big complication.

137
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:43,099
But we decided in this instance that the agencies were familiar enough with each other that we could probably do this with an intergovernmental agreement less expense less time.

138
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:51,359
And we think that we will have a binding agreement that can be to everybody's benefit.

139
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,200
So we decided that we would have the collaboration that we need.

140
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,000
And be able to establish a governance process.

141
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,940
We didn't really need a lot more than that to get started.

142
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,339
So remember what we're doing is a starter service.

143
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:27,500
So the IGA creates a joint service executive oversight committee, JS EOC that acts on behalf of the group.

144
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,099
And remember that the group is the executives of each of the agencies.

145
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,099
So the group is.

146
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,920
General manager Johnson. It's hard not to say Deborah. Sorry.

147
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,559
And our president.

148
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,079
Okay.

149
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,240
Yeah.

150
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,099
The.

151
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:07,759
Actually, the executives are are the voting body that I'm sorry. I'm thinking of our principles meetings, then, which you attend.

152
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,259
And so does the board chair of our PRD.

153
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,019
But the voting members of the JSEOC are General manager Johnson.

154
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:24,339
And interim general manager, Chrissy Bright at FRPRD.

155
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:33,380
The executive of CTO the executive of CTE and Shoshan Alu or her delicate.

156
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,559
And the governor for his.

157
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Which is Lisa.

158
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:50,160
The JSEOC becomes the single entity that BNSF has been asking for all along.

159
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:54,220
The wants one neck to choke, I guess.

160
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
Wait, that you can think about that.

161
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:04,460
The IGA does not supersede or impact the authority of any body.

162
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:14,880
So all of the boards act just as I always have. You will continue to have the control that you want and need in order to fulfill your obligations.

163
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,960
Fiduciarily and otherwise.

164
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:26,099
The boards will make all the decisions regarding appropriations, budgeting, funding.

165
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:36,539
Unless those decisions have been expressly delegated by the individual governing body to someone, for instance, your general manager.

166
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:51,119
It is expected that the JSEOC will make the decisions that they make by a measure of 50% plus one.

167
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,460
Which, so you don't have to do the arithmetic is a vote of four to prevail.

168
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:11,380
Upon an adoption of the financial plan, and this is at the end of at the conclusion of a successful negotiation with BNSF.

169
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,759
We have learned what the real costs are of this project.

170
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:25,279
And we have learned how big your financial contributions will be. And that financial plan will be adopted.

171
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,759
And after that, all voting will be majority.

172
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,500
Just a majority vote.

173
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:47,039
Unless an until one person or more than one choose to ask for a weighted vote.

174
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:57,880
This is not a sure thing, but today we are still carrying a weighted vote opportunity after the adoption of the financial plan.

175
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:09,440
If one of the members asks for a weighted vote that will happen and the waiting is as of the contributions of the parties.

176
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,680
And contributions, of course, will be carefully.

177
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,279
Carefully defined and is still a very open definition in the documents.

178
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,200
I think you're not in this slide.

179
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,539
So sorry, thank you, please.

180
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,079
The JSEOC will steer the negotiations with BNSF.

181
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,500
Will be responsible for soliciting an operator for the passenger rail service.

182
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:55,319
And they will be laying the foundation for the future expansion of the front range passenger of the district.

183
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:03,559
The JSEOC will strive to implement the joint service project in such a way that it will not render in feasible.

184
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,119
The existing operations of RTD or the future plans for the French passenger rail district.

185
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:15,299
That sounds very legal and a little bit hard to operate with.

186
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,640
So we're looking at that language and trying hard to come up with a language that will.

187
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:28,640
And so as sure that the front range passenger rail is not impeded in the future by what we're doing.

188
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,859
With our project with the small starter,

189
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,519
Project that we're working on today.

190
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:47,440
The IGA also provides a process for transfer of interest assets and obligations of one of the parties to others.

191
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,079
Or two outsiders as well.

192
00:24:51,480 --> 00:25:07,859
This is a process that again is still under discussion and redrawing to try to make it a fair way to transfer if transfer is wanted.

193
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:18,259
It actually is important in order to assure that in the in the event of a need to break up the partnership.

194
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,980
We have a orderly process in place that will help that happen.

195
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:31,140
There are many instances of large groups of.

196
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:40,880
And we have a part of participants who end up not being able to make work and it's best to have a process of place in the original and relative possible.

197
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,759
So our timeline.

198
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,180
In May.

199
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:53,099
Just barely we managed to get the workshops all done with parties.

200
00:25:54,099 --> 00:26:03,200
In June we'll do another RTD board update and that one will in in tail some specificity about.

201
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:21,799
Dollars and sense that we don't have quite yet and certainly it will lead us on the pathway to negotiations with BNSF which obviously have to occur and conclude before we will know what the financial picture really is and adopt the financial play and for project.

202
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:24,000
June and July.

203
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:50,400
The boards begin voting and approving the IGA so in June the CTI of the CTE and the Transportation Commission will all have their opportunity to approve the IGA and June the FRPRD will have their opportunity to approve the IGA and then in July you folks will have your opportunity to do the same.

204
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,660
You get to be lost.

205
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,500
Through the winter all the boards will work to adopt the financial plan.

206
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:20,380
Again, it will be negotiations with BNSF or critical and key here and those have to be ongoing and we hope that during the winter all the boards will be able to adopt the financial plan that's based on the successful access agreement and.

207
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,359
Construction agreements that we've achieved with the NSF.

208
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:32,119
The summer of next year the JSEOC will conduct procurement for rolling stock and for the operator.

209
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,720
And then in January of 2029 joint service train begins.

210
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:45,700
That's you know tomorrow in the right in the train world.

211
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:49,599
So optimistic aggressive.

212
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,480
Yes, all opposed.

213
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,859
Just real quick as a correction.

214
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:02,359
Ms. Barrett it says winner of 26 on there believe it is winner of 2025 all boards to adopt financial plan.

215
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:04,720
Yes.

216
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,960
Could expand the year 26.

217
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:09,319
In June.

218
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,319
Thank you.

219
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:15,279
But hopefully hopefully.

220
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,440
Thank you.

221
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,079
Chairman.

222
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:18,420
Okay.

223
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,180
So in the June board update what will I do just another boring.

224
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,319
Turn out but.

225
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,319
We'll have sent out the finalized IGA draft on all board workshops.

226
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,880
The new cost estimate by H and T B will be presented.

227
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,660
It's very interesting.

228
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,779
We have looked in all the couch covers and we have found many pennies.

229
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:49,099
So we are.

230
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:51,900
We're going to be showing you some new numbers.

231
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,140
There'll be a new financial scenario based on those new cost estimates.

232
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,940
And this time will include.

233
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:03,420
Fairbox collections because we will have.

234
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:26,019
The number we are here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here

235
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:32,980
that's it for our report and we'd be pleased to take your question.

236
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,619
Excellent. Well, thank you both for coming and enjoying us again. We greatly appreciate and

237
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:46,480
greatly appreciate your guys' time. So now I'm going to leave it up to the board if they have any questions for the two of you.

238
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,619
Are there any directors or questions?

239
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,640
Treasure Branker.

240
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:02,180
Well, first of all, thank you for coming. Again, we've been doing Yomans work here and

241
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:09,000
providing leadership on this project which is extremely valuable and appreciated.

242
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:15,400
I do have a couple of questions. Actually, I've got many. I'll keep it short though.

243
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:24,140
When you talk about a weighted vote for this joint operating agreement, could you give me an example

244
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:39,900
how would that work? Well, Lisa will chip in afterwards. A weighted vote would give

245
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:53,440
more weight to a vote by a party that has contributed more than another party. So the definition of

246
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:05,200
contributions is being heavily debated among the council guided by their principles, of course.

247
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:14,440
There are lots of different ideas about how to do that. For instance, we had in one draft

248
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:22,259
the specifics of the peak rail study as having been an expenditure that RTD

249
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:30,160
would get credited with because it was huge amount of money. I think $8 million or something like that

250
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:40,380
as you all know better than I do. And the BNSF study, so wanting to make sure that that was included in

251
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:50,440
contributions and it was suggested I think from from your council. And we were talking about it

252
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,279
behind the scenes and we said, well, you know, we don't want everybody putting in every example

253
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,759
of every time they've spent money and so forth. And so we'll just say by example, we won't say by

254
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:09,759
example, we'll just say here's the definition of what a contribution is. It became clear to us that

255
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:19,619
we specifically wanted to delineate the peak study because a it was unique among other studies and

256
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:27,619
expenditures that people have have made. But we still don't want to enumerate every single

257
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:34,079
expenditure, but we're going to put that one in specifically because it was large and it was

258
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:43,400
important throughout our studies and will continue to be. So contributions is a financial contribution

259
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:52,680
that again, the definition will be further refined as we talk more.

260
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,140
Mr. Chair, if I if I could continue, then how would you something to think about you don't have

261
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,160
to answer it right now, but they're very well maybe one time contributions that are made as well

262
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:10,380
as annual contributions that are made. So however that is calculated, hopefully that is taken into

263
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:24,339
consideration. Well the amounts right total and integral would be heavily a part of the amount itself

264
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:32,539
is a very important part of the analysis. Okay and then one more question then if you don't mind

265
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:43,779
you should. Yeah, a total contribution, a total contribution would be even if you were paying it

266
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:50,599
over time, it would the total contribution would be what you would be. So if there was a bond then

267
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:58,799
you would calculate the 30 year payment of a bond as well as one time deposit show. Yes,

268
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,680
at the beginning of the project. Yes, okay interesting. You mentioned that you're talking between

269
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:11,199
three and five trips a day. How are you where are we in the potential of five trips?

270
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm going to ask Lisa to take that one. Yeah, so I think there was an updated cost estimate

271
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,239
that looked at the five round trips and I think that it's really kind of on the

272
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,360
bubble if there is enough existing resources at this point to pursue five round trips. And so we've

273
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:42,039
really been focusing on the three daily round trips. It's also been an active dialogue with VNSF and

274
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:50,559
they certainly would prefer that any inter-easancy agreement be prioritizing starting off at

275
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:57,780
two to three round trips with the expectation that you would increase frequency as new resources

276
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:04,119
became available and as the service was successful and operating on their line with the existing

277
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,800
infrastructure dictated in the access agreement. And so it's not envisioned that you would end

278
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,380
without amount of frequency but that that's where you're starting point is. And as you might know

279
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:24,679
FRPRD is currently doing open houses and workshops on their alternative analysis. And part of

280
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:29,900
the alternative analysis for front-range passenger rail is a benchmark study of all

281
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:35,119
inner city passenger rail services in the country and what they looked at was where do they

282
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,960
start and where do they kind of top out and what you find is a lot start with two to three round trips

283
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:49,199
and then the kind of high level is between 12 and 16 round trips for inner city passenger rail.

284
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:55,460
And so that is kind of the range in which we would expect to try to reach eventually with our

285
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:01,500
ridership demand being built up and with added capacity on the line to accommodate new frequency

286
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,039
is certainly all the states hope that front-range passenger rail eventually goes to the ballot

287
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:13,460
and is successful so that we can increase frequency with new resources that they bring to the table.

288
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:21,500
Thank you, Shenzher. Prior to recognizing the first-ficed Cherokee that do want to make

289
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,800
I do want to make note that at around 340 director music and director Rishia did join us online.

290
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:32,280
Thank you. First-ficed Cherokee. Thank you Mr. Cher and I will note that director

291
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,160
put his hand up as soon as he got on the call you didn't even know who we were debating at this time.

292
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:50,500
Just like that. Or something. So, I could see Diane this bear it. You know what they call

293
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,239
going to the same body four times and not getting what they call the body that you go to four times

294
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:01,699
and they don't get this don't get a yes. Pearl board. So you're coming to the Pearl board.

295
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:09,840
So the a couple things that actually the previous question we think of it is there a minimum

296
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:18,200
contraption is so an entity doesn't give any money or did they get no vote when you go to a waiting vote?

297
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,320
Okay. Oh, yes. Yeah.

298
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:34,539
I'm not generally quiet. So could you repeat that real quick? I don't explain how that works.

299
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:40,139
But the recording. Yeah. Exactly. How would that work? I'm sorry. How would that work?

300
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,679
So if you're pro-ready now based on contribution but there are entities that don't

301
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:54,059
give anything do you give them to get a minimum like 10% vote or what's the idea on the waiting

302
00:37:54,059 --> 00:38:01,900
and it will matter more in construction than that. Right. So I mean I'm particularly interested

303
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:08,739
and if we're going to wait waiting a correctly. Well and and that's why we're struggling with the

304
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:17,739
language of the definition of contributions and with how the actual waited works. So there's no

305
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:28,460
there is no thought of taking away a vote. So each of the six has a vote and for most

306
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:35,599
most actions that will be taken, everybody's vote will be the same.

307
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:41,880
After the adoption of the finance plan and when we're actually

308
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:49,980
creating a project that has a cost and a budget and is sticking with all of that, then

309
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:57,240
most votes will be one vote, one person. But if we have to go to a weighted vote,

310
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:08,059
the amount of votes will increase by the contribution level.

311
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:15,239
Okay. Can I maybe jump in with an example of this? So I think the current way that IJ is

312
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:23,619
contemplated is the bodies would govern with 50% plus one and that would be the governing rules

313
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:29,880
through negotiations with BNSF to get to an access agreement, then a finance plan would

314
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,579
come out of the access agreement based off of actually having an infrastructure project list

315
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:42,579
and more solid numbers. And instance and where you might want a weighted vote is, you know,

316
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:48,500
say the service is an operation for three years and we think that it's worth having a discussion

317
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:54,960
on adding a siding because it might improve performance and you know, being on time performance.

318
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:04,039
You would presume that the entities would then vote through 50% plus one, but somebody could

319
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:10,300
ask for a weighted vote on that decision based off of contributions. It's designed to give

320
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:16,000
an added layer of protection for the entities that are contributing large amounts. But of course,

321
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:21,900
there's another layer of protection for the agencies that are contributing to the service because

322
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:29,159
all of those appropriations still have to be appropriate by the originating board. And nobody could

323
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:35,920
be forced by the Interagency Agreement to appropriate any money for the service. And so it's just

324
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,440
an added layer of protection for the entities that have the most equity into the service.

325
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:48,000
Okay. But I think that the practice, what we expect to see is that the majority rule would be

326
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,159
how decisions are made. Yeah, I would hope so. But if you need to go to a weighted vote,

327
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:57,960
things aren't going well. So I think you may want to work a amount of how that would

328
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,179
work. And so just a couple of things. Can we get a copy of the idea?

329
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,000
I've asked just about everybody. I almost asked a guy out on the street. I might have it.

330
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,400
So I looked at General Manager Johnson, but my understanding was that the general counsels for

331
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,280
each agency was sharing with their governing boards to protect client privilege. So I don't know

332
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,480
where that may be. Got lost in translation, but that's how we've done it at least in the

333
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,599
Executive Branch where each Attorney General assigned to each agency has shared it with those four.

334
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:46,480
That's perfect. She just gave me the answer. But there she's been going to have to layer at me.

335
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:55,400
So the only other things, and I just think this is important to at least start talking about

336
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,480
in the context of the IGA. I understand the IGA is not designed to set a budget request.

337
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:08,559
But I do think it should set parameters that that under no circumstances aboard would support.

338
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,039
That's so we have to decide voting ourselves what is something we would not accept.

339
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,760
And I'll give you two examples that I will specifically ask for.

340
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:28,800
First, who's the backstop if it goes over? If I know to shock people for me to think that a

341
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,159
rail project might be over budget. But just in case we found one that does, who pays?

342
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:41,579
And at what percentage? And I think that's really important going into negotiations with

343
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:46,860
NSF because that's going to be your biggest expenditure. And people should know they're negotiating

344
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:54,039
position before they go away on with the NSF. And I think that helps when negotiators. It's also helpful

345
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:59,340
that the board say, look, under no circumstances and with the backstop, we will give you the amount of

346
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,119
money in the agreement and no more. Or we will give you more and this is what our percentage looks like.

347
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,019
I think that's really really important. The second thing is, and this is a, like a cut and

348
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:16,820
dry issue for me, under no circumstances can all the fights that money go to this project.

349
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,739
There are several unfinished projects in fast tracks and there are a lot of disappointed voters.

350
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,559
And I'm not saying it has to be countered out percentage wise to the penny.

351
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,280
There certainly could be greater waiting to this project because it actually has a greater chance

352
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:44,199
to go and forward. But under no circumstances, what I vote for anything that is takes the vast

353
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:50,599
honor and the vice of money because I probably wouldn't make it back across the Douglas County line

354
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:57,639
alive. So that's just, I think those parameters that we can start to stake out for you before

355
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:03,239
we vote would be really helpful. So the negotiators aren't left in a tough position. Sorry, Mr.

356
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:03,480
Chair.

357
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,760
Can I react to that? So I'm just going to say.

358
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,420
The goal would be that the access agreement would have an infrastructure list that corresponds

359
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:20,119
with the daily round trips, right? So it might be that, for instance, if you want it, five daily

360
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:27,199
round trips, that would require seven new sightings. And then what the finance plan would

361
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:34,559
then say is here are the sightings that are needed in order to accommodate the five daily round trips.

362
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:41,639
Here are the ones that are in the RTD region. Here are the ones that are out. And then that finance plan

363
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:49,440
would be what came back next winter to say here's kind of the pieces of who's going to finance what.

364
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:55,820
And then to your point, then if any one project goes over what is that

365
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:02,300
look like and how do you handle any overages? But it would be what are anticipation based off

366
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,619
of the current cost estimates, right? As if we're negotiating for two or three daily round trips

367
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:13,820
with them is that there is that infrastructure cost associated with it. We have some ideas of what

368
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:20,380
those are based off of the RTC modeling that was done ahead of the March 1st report. And the RTC

369
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:26,900
model is based off of the business data provided under an NDA from BNSF. So it's a very informed

370
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:36,260
cost estimate. What is coming back to you in June is since then we've gotten, we've passed

371
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,639
review at the FRA under the new administration for the Chrissy Grant. So we know that those costs are

372
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:48,559
going to be covered now through that Chrissy Grant. So those kind of refinements is coming back.

373
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:54,699
But really that finance plan has to be based off of the actual agreement with BNSF for the actual

374
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:59,699
projects and then understanding how that each one of those gets financed is what we anticipate.

375
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:09,260
I appreciate all that that really helps. The challenge is there's a finite amount that we would

376
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:16,840
chip in and I don't know what that is yet. But that would be the only money coming from this body.

377
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,639
I don't think that there's, I mean I get almost get an informal vote right now that we would

378
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:31,039
enter an agreement where we did not know what our obligation was and did not know who is responsible

379
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:37,860
when we exceeded that original budget. It might be us. That's fine. But we need to delineate

380
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:45,780
who's what and the railroad negotiation will be murkyer than we want this.

381
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:55,719
Ms. Barrett and I have done one railroad negotiation before and everything is tied together in some sort

382
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:02,400
of safety plan. They rarely will say this side is the responsibility of this customer. It's all

383
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:12,240
they're very good at creating a mismatch of requirements and costs. The experts had it.

384
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:18,500
Yeah, I would say that our hope is that it's the numerated in the agreement and in the mountain rail

385
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:24,699
access agreement that we just completed on May 1st, it is all a numerated for the project

386
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,340
by segment in which phase that you run does it trigger the need for that infrastructure. So I think

387
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,860
our hope is that we would be able to accomplish that same sort of format that we just did.

388
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:42,340
I would say on your other feedback on finished fast-racks projects. I mean I think that it's

389
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,699
hopefully clear to all not maybe we're stating that certainly we would like to partner to finish

390
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:55,340
all of them and to bring state resources to partner to finish all of them. It is called out in

391
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:04,099
Senate Bill SB 230 that the rail set aside is for both Northwest Rail and the N-line. And I think

392
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:10,800
that the hope is that we can get some clarity on where the communities are on the Southwest

393
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,719
extension and the five points project to understand how the state could also partner on those.

394
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:22,579
So it's probably worth me stating that on the mic is that the state wants to partner to finish

395
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:29,920
all on finished fast-racks projects as we see this out there as a threat to voter confidence

396
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,019
for us to get to where we want to go on our climate goals. Thank you first Vice Chair,

397
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:42,880
Keith. Director, music. Thank you very much and again thank you to Ms. Poppin and

398
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,840
despair for once again coming and giving us an update. Go one question and two comments and

399
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,500
my first the question has to do with SB 230 and that set aside the 20% set aside for

400
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,599
Northwest Rail and the N-line. I just don't remember does the legislation

401
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:10,039
determine the proportion that those lines share that 20% or not. Anybody can answer that there

402
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:17,599
might know. It does not. It just calls out prioritizing that 20% set aside for those two projects.

403
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:24,980
And so in the first first report what we did was for just the exercise of trying to identify

404
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:32,019
is there enough on allocated resources to cover the cost was to just assume a 5050 split but that is

405
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:38,880
a decision that the clean transit enterprise board needs to make. Okay so that's the the

406
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:46,019
entity that would make that decision. Okay yeah I just would not want to see the N-line swept

407
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:52,519
away to put all the money into this project. So the other comments and it has been touched on

408
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:56,420
and I have more things but we'll bring this up in executive session. I think it's more appropriate

409
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:03,960
for that but the access agreement of being us being us F. Are you going to negotiate

410
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:11,219
the cost of increased frequency because I can see them saying listen when you guys are ready to go

411
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:16,820
9 or 10 or 12 terms a day come on back and we'll talk and then then they've got you. So

412
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:22,119
hopefully we can get some incremental increase amounts of prices are cost

413
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,639
worked into that access agreement because I can see that coming back to bite us if we don't

414
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:35,740
and last but not least I mentioned all along you know we did that peak service rail study and

415
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:45,000
the per rider subsidy number scary so hopefully now I've heard illusion to

416
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,300
basically doubling the population that this line can serve and hopefully with that we'll bring

417
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:58,179
that a number down I'm still hoping to see an update on ridership projections on this whole line

418
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:03,019
and what that does to the per rider subsidy and and that's all I have for now but I'm looking

419
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:07,099
forward to it I said it once I said it again this is the only way we're getting railed there

420
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:14,579
and I hope we do it so thanks a lot. Thank you. Director one thing I would just react to of the

421
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:22,179
overall cost per rider and you know this is an unfortunate fact for this line but the single

422
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:29,000
biggest infrastructure cost for this line is to add positive train control from Westminster to

423
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,059
Fort Collins and this is a basic safety system that you would hope was on an existing

424
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:41,079
freight line that is moving you know all sorts of petrochemicals and hazardous on freight through

425
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:48,980
our northern suburbs today but it's not mandated for them to move those freight products

426
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:54,760
today it's only mandated when you add passenger rail onto the line and so when you look at the

427
00:51:55,059 --> 00:52:01,079
cost a lot of it is driven by the need for positive train control which is a significant improvement

428
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:06,880
to safety for those communities that I would love to see today but it's regulated at the federal

429
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:13,039
level we can't regulate it at the state level it is a big part of the Chrissy grant is extending

430
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:20,500
positive train control up to broomfield and it's a service I think to safety to all of us to

431
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:26,340
invest in getting positive train control on this line for freight operations which is why we were

432
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:32,539
able to successfully partner with the NSF to get that Chrissy grant and the way that that worked was

433
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:38,960
it we took the engineering work and the study done through the peak rail study and we were able

434
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,239
to utilize that engineering work in order to put in a Chrissy grant that was you know close to

435
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,340
shove the shovel ready so as a great return on your investment for peak rail that we were able

436
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:56,400
to secure over $90 million investment that is a safety feature that is needed today whether or

437
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,800
not we ever put a passenger on it so it's a little bit of a misnomer when you look at the cost it

438
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,420
we're kind of bearing the full cost of needing a basic safety feature that we should all

439
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:14,380
want to have on there today for freight operations. Thank you Dr. Countlyn.

440
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:27,199
Thank you and I have may have a lot of questions but I met five years ago along with our engineers

441
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:36,579
staff down in Fort Worth with the BNSF and at that time to Dr. O'Keef's point with the railroads

442
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:45,619
it's a moving target and have they reviewed these costs independently that's question number one.

443
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:54,579
So they've seen our presentation they haven't done a verification process but they also

444
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:06,559
agree directly with where we've been on our costs. I think that they would say is you know

445
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,539
lower frequency for starting that the cost could actually probably go further down than where we are

446
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:19,559
today with that is for negotiations with them. You brought up a good point I just know that when we

447
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:28,559
when we were talking about the peak rail study we had to pay the railroads to do the cost estimate

448
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:37,960
and so I just wanted to board to be aware of that. The next thing when you talk about increased

449
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:43,000
frequencies and I remember that was a sticking point during those preliminary discussions

450
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,139
there has to be a ceiling I mean there beyond which their operations couldn't support

451
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:53,360
additional frequencies and has that been discussed or called out.

452
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:02,440
I think that there's a ceiling before you get to having to double track significant mileage

453
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:08,360
as maybe what you're asking and I think this is included in the full build out for front range

454
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:15,380
passenger rails all turn of analysis that kind of goes through based off of the RTC modeling done

455
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:22,340
for them when you trigger additional sightings or double tracking meet it so that is in the service

456
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:29,599
development plan for front range passenger rail and it's based off of BNSF's business data both

457
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:36,900
for operations today and their forecast operations for the future. So this was something that was

458
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:45,940
a new process really came out of kind of the missteps of California high speed rail of not

459
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:51,519
really having this modeling done on the front end and also not having the business case for

460
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:58,099
rail operations done on the front end and really just waiting for a new process before you get to any

461
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:05,360
of those processes. So when IJ passed they created this new process for these service development plans

462
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,380
that is a federal document that goes through each step of this that front range passenger rail

463
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:15,500
is currently doing and we're actually the first rail project in the country that is this far ahead

464
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,960
with it and so there was a period of time where we were stalled a little bit because we were the

465
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:28,179
first to enter into NDAs with the class one railroads to get the business data in to inform our RTC

466
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:38,159
modeling and that is now we have the NDAs done the RTC modeling is undergoing for all those

467
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:44,400
increased frequencies and RTC model then tells you what all the infrastructure improvements are based

468
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,880
off of those frequencies. Well good I want to say that they're usually pretty stingy with their

469
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,920
data so could be well for getting that hick a while. You brought something else up and that's the

470
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:04,579
NIPA process and for pardon me I'm testing off the cobwebs from years ago but there's a

471
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:20,860
process for approving fixed rail through the doctor called process I think it's called Senate

472
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:30,440
meeting to go through that process for this as well even though the project limits extend beyond

473
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:37,099
the doctor called region. You know it's a good question that I don't have a complete resolution on

474
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:44,179
we have had conversations with Dr. Cog leadership on this and they aren't clear either if this

475
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:49,880
project would be subject to it I believe Northwest Rail has already been approved by them and is

476
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:57,239
they're underlying as part of fast trips it was. Right and so it's unclear because this is

477
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:03,519
you know a slight modification and it extends beyond their borders so it is an outstanding

478
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:08,940
question I have into the Attorney General's Office on it and you know maybe we need some cleanup

479
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:15,880
legislation to clarify that too it's unclear. It just needs some clarity on it I think. Yep and I

480
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:23,760
had one more thought but I guess it can wait. Last night I trained up that and that. I'm

481
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,480
ardent upon but thank you all for your hard work. I'm sure we'll have more questions as time

482
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,699
go on but I appreciate it thank you. Thank you Dr. Cotlin. I have three directors in the queue

483
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:44,619
I have Secretary Nicholson next. Thank you very much Chair Bouquet. I actually have a question for staff

484
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:51,980
before I ask questions of our lovely guests and the first the question is I know there's a

485
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:58,659
provision either in the RTD Act or in our bylaws that requires a super majority of the board

486
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:14,599
to approve any new rail projects is my understanding so would this require the the

487
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:22,699
rules from us. Ms Johnson. Yes thank you very much Secretary Nicholson for the question I believe

488
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:28,059
General Counsel Snyder is due to an opinion on that previously and so we will re-circulate that document

489
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:37,099
thank you. Okay appreciate that. The second so now switching over to our our wonderful guests

490
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:45,460
two questions. First one given that this service doesn't happen without RTD's substantial financial

491
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:54,039
contribution why shouldn't we get a veto over any JSEOC decision if you eventually need to get our

492
00:59:54,039 --> 01:00:03,260
approval and our money to make this happen? Well I think you essentially do because it still has to

493
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:12,159
originate from you appropriating money or entering into any contract that RTD would enter into.

494
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:20,179
What the joint executive committee would do would be kind of the day-to-day manager of the

495
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:30,139
negotiations with BNSF or any day-to-day management of a selected operator but you know any major

496
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:38,500
decision that impacted the ability to actually implement the project would still have to be decided upon

497
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:47,679
by the RTD board. Thanks yeah to be clear I was talking about the a veto by our person on the

498
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:55,400
JSEOC over a decision by the JSEOC because again without our 40 million a year or whatever it ends

499
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:01,960
up being you guys the train doesn't happen was essentially my question I guess I'll just leave that out there

500
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:09,039
second question forgive me for this there's an internet meme about a relationship between a man

501
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:13,300
and a woman in a relationship about to be intimate and the caption reads aren't you forgetting

502
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:19,760
someone with a picture of Jesus off to the side? I mentioned this because reading over the timeline

503
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,039
there's a lot of mentions of RTD in CTIO in the governor but it seems like there's no time

504
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:30,860
built in after the finalization of the financial plan to go to the public and ask the voters and

505
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:37,019
talk to the voters and present to the voters about what we're doing what it costs and why we should

506
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:42,440
do it in the first place. So my question to you is basically why shouldn't we bake in time to do a

507
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:49,480
real roadshow of this project? Why shouldn't the governor go to places and present on this train that

508
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:56,519
he wants why shouldn't we go and present on these things before we take a massive history defining

509
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:04,460
vote on this item and allocate hundreds of millions of dollars of the public's money. It seems

510
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:09,400
like you don't want that to happen or you would have put time for it in the schedule and I'm

511
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:16,420
curious whether I'm reading that correctly thanks. Yeah I would say that throughout this whole process

512
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:25,639
we are doing significant public engagement. I know I personally do a lot of presentations to a lot

513
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:33,880
of different community members so presenting to city councils along the corridor, the general public.

514
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:40,480
So there is inherently baked into the project, a lot of community engagement. It's just not

515
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,380
a numerated in these slides. These slides were more of an overview of what the project is

516
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:51,340
but I would also say that you know clearly the public has voted in fast tracks in O4. They voted

517
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:57,380
when they elected their representatives in the general assembly that passed these bills

518
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:05,039
and there is inherent built into this community engagement that we just did not to the slides but

519
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:11,599
we certainly can give you a report on all of the public engagement to date. It's actually a pretty

520
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:17,480
long section in the March 1st report on all the community engagement that happened and

521
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,360
lead up to the March 1st report. I would anticipate we would have a similar one in the June report.

522
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:29,719
Yeah and actually there was one in the 30 September as well. So all the reports that we've put out

523
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:38,119
and the one that we is coming contain lists of who we've talked to and generally speaking in what

524
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:45,980
any of these. Secretary. Just very quickly. I mean I'm a pretty engaged guy in Denver, in

525
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:52,679
Central Denver. Have you guys done any presentations, public presentations in my district? Have you

526
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:58,699
done any kind of you know when we've done big changes when we talked about BRT we do big roadhouse

527
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:05,699
presentations. We bring the public in you know it's in the news it's on our website. I read the post

528
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:10,239
practically every day. Most of my friends do. I go on Reddit on a regular basis. I have

529
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,820
and you guys on there. I haven't seen literally any big public events about this project explaining

530
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:21,179
it to people. I've seen one article about hey this is coming the trains coming sooner than you expected

531
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:26,400
it would. That's all anybody in my district knows about this at this point and I'll just be honest.

532
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:33,159
I don't see myself even if I like the project. I don't see myself voting for it unless I think that

533
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:40,340
you guys your boss has done the work necessary to sell this to the public and to sell this to

534
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:45,039
the people who are here now, not necessarily the people who are here when I wasn't legally able to

535
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:58,239
drink. Thanks. Thank you, Secretary. Thank you, thank you both for all your work and all the team.

536
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:05,320
I agree with director music. This is the way to get the service done and the starter service.

537
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:12,079
I have a couple of questions. We mentioned that 42 million would be coming from the state.

538
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:22,319
How does that come? Is the 230 money come out of CTE and how much is that and the CTIO

539
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:30,199
then put in is that a total of several different contributions from those different groups?

540
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:37,840
Yeah, that is a total of several different contributions and so I think it would be a mixture of CTIO

541
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:45,059
investing in the projects that the construction projects that they would invest in finance and

542
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:52,440
probably oversee the execution of same thing for CTE and then the you know in the March 1st report

543
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:58,719
we weren't sure if the Chrissy Grant projects would get done because they were under a review

544
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:03,340
of the new administration that has since been greenlighted by the new administration and so

545
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:10,559
that would probably be a new contribution that would be reflected in the mixture of contributions

546
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:19,760
and those money came from the governor's IHA cash fund to match the federal funds.

547
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:28,940
Thanks. And just one other comment which is that I think this happened in one of the statues

548
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:41,019
161 161 yeah but I think that joint service talking about being Northwest rail is confusing

549
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:47,480
and maybe it's better to maybe the line which is important that it's service on the Northwest

550
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:57,780
corridor to sort of pull apart. Northwest rail was defined in you know fast tracks project

551
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:05,119
and so it's just a thought and maybe something we can we can talk about after we see the

552
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:10,239
IGA and all of that thank you very much. They ended up something there you look like you were

553
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:16,500
going to respond. I was just going to say that the statues is Northwest fixed guide way.

554
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,380
Thank you director guys here. Dr. Risha.

555
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:38,579
Thank you Mr. Chair. So as usual director Katlyn got to a question before I did and I just wanted

556
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:47,199
to offer that I had up until this moment always assumed that Dr. Cog would need to be involved

557
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:54,980
because of just a plain language reading of statues. So I would also add that if we need to clarify

558
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:09,320
that we should do that as soon as possible which would be next session. But I also I feel like I

559
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:19,880
showed the you and my colleagues that just honesty that my district, that's tracks is not something

560
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:27,239
I hear about in my district. Nor is this project. I've been on the board for two and a half years

561
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:34,460
and I think I have been asked about it less than ten times and half of them were from reporters

562
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:44,060
to be to be honest. And so I have seen concern that proponents of the project aren't doing

563
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:53,980
the necessary work in my district which is very active in local matters to get there by end.

564
01:08:56,409 --> 01:09:06,609
And even if we move forward without FRPR having statutory authority to tax because it was

565
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:11,229
granted by the voters or you know we have some sort of alternative method.

566
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:19,729
At the end of the day we are going to be held responsible by the larger public and it's really

567
01:09:19,729 --> 01:09:25,189
crucial to ensure that we have their buy-in. So the feedback I gave was anecdotal. That's just my

568
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:39,569
experience. But I would I would feel irresponsible if I if I didn't put that out there because

569
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:46,729
it really does worry me that we might be getting married without a pre-nap or we're moving too

570
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:56,590
but we don't have public buy-in. So just like in other parts of RTD where the fact that

571
01:09:56,590 --> 01:10:06,210
these projects were not finished creates distrust. We have to remember that not all parts of the

572
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:14,869
district or the greater region share that sentiment and we just need to be careful and how we

573
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:19,029
move forward because at the end of the day no matter what happens in this board room or at the

574
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:25,989
state level or the executive level we are ultimately going to respond to the taxpayers.

575
01:10:30,569 --> 01:10:35,710
I would like to see this project and all rail projects get built out.

576
01:10:36,789 --> 01:10:46,430
I don't like cars and I don't like concrete jungles. I have concerns about the fiscal

577
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:52,810
aspect that I think first vice-gero-key some don't much more eloquently than I could.

578
01:10:54,949 --> 01:11:02,189
But I would like to think it's possible. So I'm looking for a reason to say yes and I just need a

579
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:10,409
little bit more to get there and that's a bit painful to say in a public meeting with my colleagues

580
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:19,449
but at this juncture it doesn't do any of us any good if we are not fourth right in where we are.

581
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:25,489
So thank you for letting me speak in that concludes my comments.

582
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:38,829
I have to second first vice-gero-key there's absolutely no way I would vote for this if we're

583
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:42,609
going to just completely empty out whatever it receives to be the big piggy bank the vice account.

584
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:49,170
That $19 million is not just for rail as has been reported and reported and re-reported

585
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:53,750
incorrectly there were caveats with that money for how it was to be used in conjunction with the

586
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:58,250
fast tracks plans and I think that we need to go back to the legislation and look at that.

587
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:04,510
Also the vice-er account was created after the 0.04% sales and use tax was collected and there are

588
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:11,029
additional money that are in there that are also not directly linked to that legislation and so

589
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:15,149
untangling that could be a big mess but also we need to be responsible with it as is our

590
01:12:15,149 --> 01:12:22,409
fiduciary duty. It does support service services along the northwest corridor not just the

591
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:29,550
fixed rail but also other other bus services and connections that were part of the anticipated

592
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:35,930
cost of moving people around and it supports the maintenance and the transit asset management

593
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:39,949
along that rail and so one thing that I have not heard come out of these conversations that

594
01:12:39,949 --> 01:12:45,409
is going to be it's going to keep me on the no-site until I understand it in terms of an

595
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:51,250
IGA is how we are going to plan the transit asset management piece of this how are we going to

596
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:57,430
do maintenance and repair work because the cost of a shiny new thing is one thing but maintaining

597
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:03,369
it to continue good usage and safety for the public is a completely different matter and we have

598
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:08,210
just spent the last two summers I'm going to include the current one we're walking into now

599
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:15,210
doing exactly that work because it was forgotten for more than 20 years and it cannot happen

600
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:21,050
with this project so if money is not set aside or anticipated with all the glory of putting a

601
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:26,989
brand new shiny train on a track to get people moving and continue to maintain that asset

602
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:34,470
by all members of the IGA absolutely not there's no way we can continue forward with the conversation

603
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:38,550
it's not even worth having so if that money is not accounted for somewhere in the finance

604
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:43,109
planning of doing this there's no way we would do it and why do I say that because safety has to

605
01:13:43,109 --> 01:13:48,470
come first human lives are at risk and a danger so as you spoke to the positive train control

606
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:53,970
and all of the other necessary infrastructure to do this maintenance of these tracks and these

607
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:59,329
conveyances are going to be equally important and should not be put to the side in a rush

608
01:13:59,329 --> 01:14:04,149
to get a train on a track that's not how we do things and that's not how we should do things

609
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:13,409
in my opinion so that's one part sorry my comment the other thing is we I have a big concern about

610
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:18,350
cannibalizing our regular service when the language that you put on the screen earlier says we will

611
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:25,010
I believe it will strive to implement the joint service plan that will not render

612
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:33,489
infisible the existing operations of RTD from or from or the future plans for FRPRD

613
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:39,909
we are running an active transit agency we have services going we collect the sales and use tax

614
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:45,989
of a total of 1% point 1% but it's divided in how we use it with funds being restricted to

615
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:51,930
certain aspects of it that is where we have to consider how we are going to as a body put money

616
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:57,489
into this and where it's going to come from but the backstop question is super important because

617
01:14:57,489 --> 01:15:04,430
the backstop if it falls to us to fix the matters that are overrun on finances can literally cut

618
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:10,069
bus service jobs and take away the things that we are currently providing and that would not be fair

619
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:17,310
for a three round trip a day service to one particular area of the region because it doesn't

620
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:24,829
take into consideration everybody's need to move around our entire region that's all I have thank you

621
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,310
thank you director Bruce Mong director Hwork

622
01:15:30,349 --> 01:15:39,329
I have a few questions in thoughts but the first question is you reference 83 million for the first

623
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:45,949
year operations 32 for operations maintenance 51 in debt service with that 51 million in mine what

624
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:50,910
is the amount of debt I just if you could remind me what the amount of debt that you anticipate taking on

625
01:15:53,249 --> 01:16:00,470
so the March 1st report is that study so it's looking at how much would it cost in current

626
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:09,489
borrowing to finance the full 885 and that's where you get a debt payment number of 51 million dollars

627
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:18,189
annually to finance the full 885 in regards to director Guzman's comments I think it's also

628
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:25,449
important to remember in the March 1st report that when you look at the full horizon of the project

629
01:16:25,449 --> 01:16:32,050
there is baked into the underlying cost assumption the state of good repair and safety on going

630
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:39,050
cost and so you probably don't remember the bars from the last presentation but it's in there

631
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:44,189
in those outer years when you have to start replacing and doing the state of good repair work

632
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:48,970
and what was important about the March 1st report is really looking at not just

633
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:55,010
is there enough existing revenue today but is there enough existing revenue to through 2050

634
01:16:55,629 --> 01:17:02,310
and so the report that Ernst and Young Creed at for us was to look at all the revenue sources

635
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:08,430
and to look at their growth trajectory to make sure that they also track with the growth trajectory

636
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:15,350
the state of good repair and escalating cost for the service and so in that March 1st report that you all

637
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:24,069
got it did do that work and you know where I showed you today that the daily rental car fee grows from

638
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:32,990
$57 million in 2026 and grows to $110 million in 2050 a similar number was in the March 1st

639
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:40,050
presentation to you all of looking at your current revenue at $900 million annually but that is

640
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:48,310
projected to grow to over $2 billion in 25 years for what RTD is currently projecting to collect

641
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:55,729
in sales tax so that mapping of the escalating cost instead of good repair against the available

642
01:17:55,729 --> 01:18:01,750
revenue sources was cornerstone to the work in the March 1st report. Thank you director

643
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:10,649
Nickleson. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. So I have a couple of questions that the first one and

644
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:17,670
I promise slightly more fun question than my last one. When we talk about three trains a day

645
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:22,789
what kind of hours are we talking about here because I've heard lots of different sort of

646
01:18:22,789 --> 01:18:28,510
understandings of like what could I use this for and you know if you're running a train back

647
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:34,710
from Denver to Boulder at 5 p.m. You know you can use that for a meeting in the middle of the

648
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,590
day you can use that for 6 p.m. or 630. You can use that for commuting you can't use that to go to a

649
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:45,409
nuggets game for example and so maybe you can help me think about and help the public

650
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:52,970
what kinds of travel is this going to serve and what kinds of stuff because again it's only three

651
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:58,010
trains a day is it going to be outside of and also are we talking about three trains a day five

652
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:03,090
seven days a week or only five days a week am I going to be able to take this down to pride for

653
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:09,189
example if we were running and do that or is it would it only be running weekday service thanks and

654
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:16,510
then I'll have I have follow-ups so. Sure. I don't know the schedule that was a part of the RTC

655
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:21,289
modeling off the top of my head but we can certainly pull that and have that a part of the June

656
01:19:22,269 --> 01:19:31,050
presentation if you so desire but it was for seven days a week and it did a just for weekend patterns

657
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:36,329
versus weekday I just don't know the exact times off the top of my head.

658
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:42,189
Appreciate it yeah that would be super helpful because when when I've gotten to it questions about this

659
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:45,850
my constituents have asked what am I going to be able to use it for if I'm in Denver one of my

660
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:51,489
able to able to do the same thing of a Boulder second question so we got a fairly

661
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:59,649
sobering I think is the right word presentation from our asset management team at our training

662
01:19:59,649 --> 01:20:03,930
I'm a relatively new director so we get a bunch of different meetings where they explain

663
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:12,630
different stuff to us and part of that training was over just how freaking expensive it is to manage

664
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:18,789
something like a fixed rail asset over the course of multiple decades and how you really have to

665
01:20:18,789 --> 01:20:23,710
think about these things not in terms of what it's going to cost for five years or ten years but

666
01:20:24,269 --> 01:20:31,109
2030 and then to replace all of it when we get there and hilariously enough in an article I think

667
01:20:31,109 --> 01:20:37,630
about sound transit to later that day I came across this wonderful quote but from Willie Brown

668
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:42,810
who is the former speaker of the California State Assembly where I grew up in the former mayor of

669
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:48,689
San Francisco in a candid admission about the political world operates Willie Brown the former

670
01:20:48,689 --> 01:20:53,489
mayor of San Francisco once dismissed the cost overruns on a transportation hub intended for the bullet

671
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:59,470
train in the world of civic projects the first budget is really just a down payment he wrote in

672
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:05,529
a guest newspaper column in 2013 if people knew the real costs from the start nothing would ever get

673
01:21:06,409 --> 01:21:12,550
the idea is to get going start digging a hole and make it so big there's no alternative to coming

674
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:18,750
up with the money to fill it in isn't that what joint service starter service kind of is

675
01:21:19,869 --> 01:21:27,949
thank you I'm I'm asking that as a question I mean no because we have a cost estimate through

676
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:34,510
2050 that was showed to you in the first presentation and map the revenue sources to the

677
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:42,390
project cost so I certainly wouldn't characterize it that way I'll just ask one quick follow up

678
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:50,170
is that's okay given the significant routine cost overruns as director of keyvaluded to that for

679
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:56,850
example high-speed railing California has undergone where the project has turned out to be

680
01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:02,430
billions more expensive than it initially cost given that we see this in public projects

681
01:22:03,369 --> 01:22:08,630
everywhere what makes you confident as someone who has worked on these things and in building

682
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:13,770
government for a long time what makes you confident that you're right this time when so often

683
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:21,369
other people get this raw I think the projects that we are looking at from a rail perspective is

684
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:26,630
very different than i-speed railing I don't even think it's like an apple to a pineapple because

685
01:22:27,929 --> 01:22:33,770
yeah it's it's not at the same species really because what we are talking about is

686
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:41,609
utilizing underutilized current infrastructure in the state of Colorado and what we have seen is an

687
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:46,529
opportunity that exists right now that even is different than when fast-track's passed in 04

688
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:51,949
when fast-track's passed in 04 there was a lot more free operations on this line than exists today

689
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:58,869
VNSF has shifted a lot of their freight operations to the grilly sub and out ease and that is

690
01:22:58,869 --> 01:23:04,189
created this opportunity to utilize an existing infrastructure asset for a new purpose

691
01:23:04,989 --> 01:23:10,489
as we're in 04 it was in more conflict with their freight operations than it is today same thing

692
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:17,210
with mountain rail we have an opportunity to use an existing asset that is underutilized because of

693
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:23,329
coal plant closures in Craig and Hayden has created this capacity on the line the lines in good

694
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:29,630
shape it's active today still moving coal but it's about to be inactive for half of the segment

695
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:37,590
when those coal plants close in 29 and so it's really taking a some cost from an infrastructure

696
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:43,649
perspective and repurposing it for a future need is how I would see these projects and I think

697
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:48,489
what's different about the way we've approached this and that we've had success with at least

698
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:53,170
unimphasific in the mountain rail access agreement is having an enumerated

699
01:23:53,970 --> 01:24:00,010
infrastructure list that corresponds with the actual daily round trips so the way that access

700
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:05,850
agreement reads is for these daily round trips three of all here's the actual infrastructure

701
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:13,029
that is needed to empower that on this timeline and certainly if that infrastructure list is priced

702
01:24:13,029 --> 01:24:18,750
out 20 years from now the escalation cost is going to be different but we have plans to do those

703
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:25,989
infrastructure projects this calendar year so we believe our cost estimates are good I don't think

704
01:24:25,989 --> 01:24:31,810
anything is ever bullet proof but I think that the benefit to the state of Colorado that we would

705
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:39,850
get from these projects of taking cars off the road and driving better land use decisions where

706
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:46,770
we have housing in fill to get to a smart growth strategy for the state of Colorado is worthy of the

707
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:54,189
cause and I think we have paved a much different way than what California has done and certainly

708
01:24:54,189 --> 01:25:00,369
I think we are all students of having watched what California has done and paved a different

709
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:06,470
way forward in Colorado that has as much certainty around it as you possibly can for a big

710
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:13,770
infrastructure project. Thank you. I'm going to go to Director Pagulari I saw his hand and I'll come back to you,

711
01:25:13,789 --> 01:25:19,510
Secretary. Thank you, Chair and thank you, guests for your presentation. I appreciate it.

712
01:25:20,489 --> 01:25:25,409
I think I just want to start out by saying the front range needs rail needs passenger rail service.

713
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:29,710
We have a growing population people moving here and bringing their cars we have increased

714
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:35,510
poor air quality there's a lot of reasons why we need rail and there's so many reasons that in

715
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:42,689
2003 the people said we need rail and they asked for it and time and time again people have asked for

716
01:25:42,689 --> 01:25:48,250
it over and over again and a legislator even this year said once again we need rail

717
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:52,569
RCD you have to build the rail that you promised to build back from the voters said you had to

718
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:58,949
build rail so I'd like to keep to our commitment towards at least doing what we can to finish fast tracks

719
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:05,729
because we need rail but I do have a little bit of a few concerns and I think I'll just highlight one concern

720
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:11,590
and a question first and then a concern I guess they're tied together but

721
01:26:12,889 --> 01:26:20,289
three strong trips per day is starter service it's useful transit for some but not as many as 10

722
01:26:20,289 --> 01:26:26,649
round trips or 12 I'd really like to see the movement towards double tracking so we can get those

723
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:32,050
higher frequencies and make this a really useful transit service for the people along the

724
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:37,869
front range of the front range district but with what we're building and what we're committing

725
01:26:37,869 --> 01:26:43,149
what this IGA first of all is just allowing something to go forward so we can get more information

726
01:26:43,149 --> 01:26:50,170
we're not committing any funds yet so I do hope you support the IGA but in the IGA I would like to see

727
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:55,130
some type of assurance that we can continue on the path towards that those 10 12

728
01:26:55,130 --> 01:27:02,149
front trips per day or double tracking and if it's possible the legislators already given FRPRD

729
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:07,430
and then revenue for collecting revenue I don't really see in the future the state giving

730
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:13,189
a couple billion dollars to build double tracked furniture in passenger rail but the people could

731
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:18,250
choose to do it so I would like I guess my question then it's not a lead a sorry but the leading

732
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:27,430
question is if it would be possible to do put some assurances in that would require this new entity

733
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:33,930
with IGA to pursue expanded service and not just stop at three trains for the thank you

734
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:43,010
thanks yeah and I think that's important feedback as to what the board would like in the IGA

735
01:27:44,109 --> 01:27:51,869
and so we can certainly take that back thank you thank you director all right any further comments

736
01:27:51,869 --> 01:27:58,890
questions secretary and then director grismoor thank you two very quick things so first off I just want

737
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:07,329
to make an important point I want this train I actually really really want this train I am one of

738
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:12,930
a handful of people on the board who doesn't have a car getting to bolder getting to long

739
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:17,329
amount this would be and I live like 10 minutes from union station this would be a massive

740
01:28:17,329 --> 01:28:24,210
improvement in my quality of life getting up to getting up the northwest and for exactly the reason

741
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:31,130
that you alluded to this coffeeman this is an opportunity to build a ton of new housing in a place

742
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:35,909
that badly needs it make it easier for people to get to Denver there are lots of reasons in principle

743
01:28:35,909 --> 01:28:42,770
to like this project the same way that I like the idea of having a summer home in Bali or a

744
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:50,029
winter home the question is can I afford it and can I make it can I make it work can I can does the

745
01:28:50,029 --> 01:28:55,850
access of me flying out there you know so really it just comes down to I'm putting you through the

746
01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:02,609
paces on this I'm running the traps I'm making this as difficult as I am because as someone who's

747
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:11,229
been involved in government since I was 18 I am terrified genuinely freaked out for you know

748
01:29:11,229 --> 01:29:18,810
have had mild panic attacks over this decision because I don't want to turn 50 or 55 or 60

749
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:25,649
and look back and say wow I signed on to a gigantic money pit on the other hand I don't want to

750
01:29:25,649 --> 01:29:31,750
look back and say wow I missed out on signing on to one of the best expansions of passenger rail

751
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:37,949
that we were ever going to have so it doesn't come from a place of disliking the project it

752
01:29:37,949 --> 01:29:44,390
comes from place of gigantic amounts of fear over the significance of this decision

753
01:29:45,229 --> 01:29:50,130
yeah I appreciate that I think it's really well found it given the history of this project and the

754
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:56,949
way we've grown as a metro area and the needs that we have in a metro area for more transit in rail

755
01:29:56,949 --> 01:30:02,869
and the constraints that we have around revenue as a state and how we can gain new revenue as a state so

756
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:10,810
I think all of that thoughtful approach is warranted which is partly why you know the step that we are

757
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:18,130
concentrating now is can we all agree on how we would make joint decisions to then go negotiate with

758
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:25,989
BNSF come back to the governing boards with the result of that and say is this ROI worth it

759
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:32,949
and that would come after a successful negotiation that would enumerate the infrastructure

760
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:40,949
that has to correspond with the access agreement for daily round trips and at that juncture I think

761
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:45,750
you would have a big decision to be made and we would have a lot more information on we have

762
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:52,069
verified the infrastructure list with BNSF we have you know the engineers price that out

763
01:30:53,029 --> 01:31:00,550
and then we have a financial model on how it would work right so you know does it make sense for

764
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:09,510
CTIO who has bonding capacity to finance all of PTC that would be enumerated in the finance plan

765
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:18,170
like how which piece of which puzzle would look at the finance plan based off of that infrastructure

766
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:26,270
list obviously RTT would need to look at just infrastructure costs within the RTT region not outside of it so

767
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:31,970
you know I think we're you know attempting to eat an elephant we have to do it chunk by chunk here

768
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:38,130
and it's really getting to a place where we all agree on how we're going to operate together to

769
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:45,050
collaborate to get to an access agreement and then once we have an access agreement how do we

770
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:50,550
create a finance plan based off of that agreement and then you all will have a big decision to be made

771
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:57,989
on the ROI of that investment we just can't get there without having those negotiations first.

772
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:05,069
Thank you based on the sake of time I'm going to have a have treasure banker and then director

773
01:32:05,069 --> 01:32:12,369
who's mom that's our final two. Thank you you know one of the things we haven't really talked about

774
01:32:12,369 --> 01:32:18,770
and I was hoping that we could get to it in our executive session but time is going by fast.

775
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:21,829
Well we can extend also in sort of board meeting what you think.

776
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:28,409
I've been trying to meet with as many of our board directors as possible and I'm hoping to meet with

777
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:34,590
everybody. I've been working I think you all know I've been working on these numbers for a long time

778
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:40,050
but last year the state legislature gave us two new revenue sources. So when we're talking about

779
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:47,949
oh my this project looks first of all the cost estimates we're getting right now are very reasonable

780
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:55,569
much less than what they were even a couple of years ago but we now have some new revenue sources out there

781
01:32:55,569 --> 01:33:01,510
and actually I was hoping Lisa wasn't going to hear me do something some of this but if you go in

782
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:06,609
and you take a look at the two new bills that were passed last year and the different pots of money that

783
01:33:06,609 --> 01:33:14,510
they put the money in we have or the state has a hundred and seventy four million dollars a year of new money

784
01:33:15,269 --> 01:33:23,550
that we need to ask for and write a grant for. So if you're talking about our TD money this could be our

785
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:31,890
TD money sorry Lisa but this is where we need to talk with the state we need to do some negotiation

786
01:33:32,549 --> 01:33:39,510
and when we're talking about how it's going to hurt our budget this is all new this is all new money

787
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:46,289
a hundred and seventy four million dollars the state legislature gave us last year or transit now

788
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:54,970
is it all our TD no probably not a chunk of it could be a big chunk of that could be and this is where

789
01:33:55,649 --> 01:34:03,310
I was hoping as a board that we could talk about this because again it's we can debate Pfizer and we

790
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:11,789
well we should and there's a lot of things that we can talk about with Pfizer but there's so much

791
01:34:11,789 --> 01:34:19,329
new money on the table there's so much opportunity and we've got some great partners here to

792
01:34:19,329 --> 01:34:26,970
make it happen and so if we do go into special session you know go ahead and pass out my last

793
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:34,789
Excel spreadsheet here I keep making tweaks to it and I will continue to do it but I guess I just

794
01:34:34,789 --> 01:34:43,550
didn't want the board to think that it's going to be coming mostly or coming out of our base budget

795
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:49,829
because it doesn't have to it could come out of the new money that the state legislature has opened

796
01:34:49,829 --> 01:34:56,890
up for us so thank you. Can I say one thing on that is it's also not just the last two bills that

797
01:34:56,890 --> 01:35:02,210
passed and actually if you go back and you look at Senate bill two sixty the past in 2021

798
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:11,729
one of the things that we created and that was the new new delivery fee and the delivery fee was

799
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:18,010
created in order to help public agencies that need to reflate to low to zero emissions and it

800
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:23,109
created around sixty million dollars in the first five years so it's that twenty nine cents that shows

801
01:35:23,109 --> 01:35:30,409
up on your Amazon bill every time you get Amazon and that you know we would love to partner

802
01:35:30,409 --> 01:35:38,489
with RTD on their refleeting strategy. Obviously refleeting for air quality improvements is a big

803
01:35:38,489 --> 01:35:43,850
priority for us and so it's not just on these rail projects do we want to be a collaborative funding

804
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:49,670
partner it's really on all of the needs the RTD has as we try to reach our mutual goals around

805
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:56,310
expanding transit rail service for the metro area and so not just the rail projects is important

806
01:35:56,310 --> 01:36:01,529
for you to hear me say there's all sorts of money that we have created to partner with RTD on

807
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:07,609
that we want to partner with RTD on and really think about how we maximize public financing tools

808
01:36:07,609 --> 01:36:12,449
that we have at the state in order to get to our broader vision of a smart growth strategy

809
01:36:12,449 --> 01:36:20,470
for the state of Colorado. Thank you Dr. Grisman. Thank you Mr. Chair. I also want to see this project

810
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:26,689
done I voted for it when it was first in front of me on a ballot when I was early voting as a young child

811
01:36:26,689 --> 01:36:37,569
right like that's be real okay. Well yeah okay I built it feels a long time ago now so I get the

812
01:36:37,569 --> 01:36:44,229
frustration of all of my long monsters who have been emailing me lovingly about trying to

813
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:48,409
approve something that we're actually not making a decision on right now but I do understand the

814
01:36:48,409 --> 01:36:53,569
frustration and consternation and I don't want to be burnt in FG and long-month by anybody okay

815
01:36:53,569 --> 01:36:58,630
I represent Denver and my concern as a director needs to be to my sub-district first and then to the

816
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:06,050
benefit of the entire region. I appreciate the outreach for partnership from the state that's the first time

817
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:11,810
I've heard it given to us that way and explain to us that way and I would like to do that partnership

818
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:17,630
as well but I am hesitant to reach my handout in return whenever time I turn around I'm attacked

819
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:23,609
or the board is attacked with the agency is attacked by the state and so from me to the administration

820
01:37:23,609 --> 01:37:28,989
of our state right now I would really appreciate it if you guys would work with us so that we can

821
01:37:28,989 --> 01:37:34,050
have a better relationship because right now I am one's bitten in Toy Shai which puts me in a defensive

822
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:41,829
mode over my agency as is my fiduciary duty of loyalty. My question though is for our missing partner

823
01:37:41,829 --> 01:37:46,890
who is not I believe represented here but when is FRP or D gonna get their taxing situation

824
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:51,689
in order and go to the voters because we can do a lot within the regional transportation district

825
01:37:51,689 --> 01:37:58,069
geography beyond that I wouldn't vote to commit any money outside of it and I don't believe we are

826
01:37:58,069 --> 01:38:02,810
legally allowed to do so there was some change in the law but I still didn't understand whether that

827
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:08,489
allowed us to do that or not and so just a final question that can come back later in the report next

828
01:38:08,489 --> 01:38:14,949
month what's going on with our partner that is absent at this point because their funding has come from

829
01:38:14,949 --> 01:38:21,729
the state and not from their own resources. Thanks. Yeah it's a great question and it's partly why

830
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:27,890
we have kind of jumped into the parade to start trying to figure out how to create this collaborative

831
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:33,270
approach to funding these projects and and again why I think it's important for you to hear me say

832
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:39,170
it's not just about funding Northwest Rail's commitment to the voters but it's about completion

833
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:44,369
of all the unfinished fast tracks projects because we have pulled multiple times front range

834
01:38:44,369 --> 01:38:50,010
passenger rail and it is not currently viable at the ballot because of the voters skepticism

835
01:38:50,529 --> 01:38:56,729
that we all collectively could be trusted with a new revenue source to do a rail project because

836
01:38:56,729 --> 01:39:03,350
of the hangover of fast tracks and so you know it's a big barrier to going back to the voters

837
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:12,010
and asking for increased resources is that they don't have an answer to this outstanding problem

838
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:19,229
and so I think it's incumbent on everyone who is trying to provide the best transit service

839
01:39:19,229 --> 01:39:25,909
and expanded service for Colorado to try to see how we problem solve around that because it's not

840
01:39:25,909 --> 01:39:32,770
just a RPR that is suffering from it. It will be the case if our TDD needs to go back to the voters

841
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:39,470
for new transit money it will be the case if there's new RTAs in the metro area that would like to

842
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:46,529
stand up service is that this is a big barrier to voters approving any additional resources.

843
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:52,109
Thank you. Director Risha.

844
01:39:54,869 --> 01:40:01,829
Thank you Mr. Chair. I might ask Perkdup when I heard polling and I have not seen the polling

845
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:06,590
that was just referenced and so I was wondering if if that's something that's available or could

846
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:12,489
be shared. I think that would be helpful for the board. Thank you. Thank you.

847
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:18,550
Sure. I'm happy to share the slide deck that I did to Colorado rails meeting a couple of

848
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:23,149
weekends ago that has some of those pertinent slides in it. Excellent.

849
01:40:24,489 --> 01:40:29,789
Well, Mr. Barrett, Miss Kaufman. Do you want to greatly appreciate you for your time. Thank

850
01:40:29,789 --> 01:40:36,250
you, Directors for comments and questions. We're looking forward to our June report and hopefully

851
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:43,170
the feedback and questions that were presented this evening will be helpful going forward.

852
01:40:43,369 --> 01:40:44,890
So I want to thank you both. Thank you.

853
01:40:50,729 --> 01:40:55,449
All right. In a moment the board will meet an executive session regarding a proposed

854
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:59,529
intergovernmental agreement related to joint service for the Northwest Rail corridor.

855
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:06,430
I'd like to amend the emotion to move into executive session to state that the special board

856
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:11,390
meeting will be deemed adjourned after it adjourns into the executive session. For public

857
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:16,250
transparency this means that once the board moves into executive session the main meeting will be

858
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:22,250
adjourned for anyone who might be in the room or remote. The regular scheduled board meeting will

859
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:32,710
occur after this meeting with the anticipated start time of I'm going to say 630 it might be a

860
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:39,090
little bit longer but anticipated start time of 630. So please note that we'll be back then.

861
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:43,789
I'll now entertain emotion to move into executive session to discuss the following.

862
01:41:43,789 --> 01:41:52,430
So to 24-6-4-424-E for determining positions relative to matter that may be subject to

863
01:41:52,430 --> 01:42:00,449
notifications, developing strategy, strategy for negotiations and instructing negotiators and 24-6-424-B

864
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:05,229
for legal advice regarding proposed intergovernmental agreement and joint service for the Northwest

865
01:42:05,229 --> 01:42:07,069
Rail corridor. Do I have a mover?

31	3260	there is just a very manual aspect of the program.
3802	12185	And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.
14431	15053	Thank you.
16838	17439	Thank you.
17459	19782	And thank you for a very clear presentation.
19862	23608	Although I have one question of clarification.
23968	26712	You talk about mirroring the existing service area.
27994	43015	One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that I don't think that the customers were restricted to the three quarter mile within a fixed route.
43720	45682	Would that change with this?
45702	50527	Any of these proposals or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?
51508	60578	As the pro the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the three quarter of a mile boundary that exists today for our accessory customers.
64122	64683	Okay, that.
67306	70629	That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.
70669	71230	Thank you.
73471	74532	Secretary Nicholson.
76575	77977	Thank you very much.
78377	85406	I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.
87469	92916	We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.
93997	96981	There are commuter routes and I
97079	105540	would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.
105600	112036	So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.
112076	113620	Otherwise, Peggy has like
114292	118021	two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.
118041	121168	There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.
122150	129347	I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of
130002	139064	not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County, when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.
139866	149308	The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.
150190	155503	I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in

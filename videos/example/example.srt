1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,260
[SPEAKER_01]: there is just a very manual aspect of the program.

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:12,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

4
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:17,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

5
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:19,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for a very clear presentation.

6
00:00:19,862 --> 00:00:23,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have one question of clarification.

7
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:26,712
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about mirroring the existing service area.

8
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:43,015
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that I don't think that the customers were restricted to the three quarter mile within a fixed route.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that change with this?

10
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:50,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of these proposals or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?

11
00:00:51,508 --> 00:01:00,578
[SPEAKER_01]: As the pro the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the three quarter of a mile boundary that exists today for our accessory customers.

12
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:04,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that.

13
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:10,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.

14
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:11,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

15
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Secretary Nicholson.

16
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:17,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

17
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:25,406
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.

18
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,916
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.

19
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:36,981
[SPEAKER_00]: There are commuter routes and I

20
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:45,540
[SPEAKER_00]: would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.

22
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, Peggy has like

23
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:58,021
[SPEAKER_00]: two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.

24
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,168
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.

25
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:09,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of

26
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:19,064
[SPEAKER_00]: not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County, when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.

27
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:29,308
[SPEAKER_00]: The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.

28
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in

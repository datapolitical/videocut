WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:03.260
[SPEAKER_01]: there is just a very manual aspect of the program.

00:03.802 --> 00:12.185
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.053
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

00:16.838 --> 00:17.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

00:17.459 --> 00:19.782
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for a very clear presentation.

00:19.862 --> 00:23.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have one question of clarification.

00:23.968 --> 00:26.712
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about mirroring the existing service area.

00:27.994 --> 00:43.015
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that I don't think that the customers were restricted to the three quarter mile within a fixed route.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that change with this?

00:45.702 --> 00:50.527
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of these proposals or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?

00:51.508 --> 01:00.578
[SPEAKER_01]: As the pro the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the three quarter of a mile boundary that exists today for our accessory customers.

01:04.122 --> 01:04.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that.

01:07.306 --> 01:10.629
[SPEAKER_02]: That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.

01:10.669 --> 01:11.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

01:13.471 --> 01:14.532
[SPEAKER_00]: Secretary Nicholson.

01:16.575 --> 01:17.977
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

01:18.377 --> 01:25.406
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.

01:27.469 --> 01:32.916
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.

01:33.997 --> 01:36.981
[SPEAKER_00]: There are commuter routes and I

01:37.079 --> 01:45.540
[SPEAKER_00]: would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.

01:45.600 --> 01:52.036
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.

01:52.076 --> 01:53.620
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, Peggy has like

01:54.292 --> 01:58.021
[SPEAKER_00]: two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.

01:58.041 --> 02:01.168
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.

02:02.150 --> 02:09.347
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of

02:10.002 --> 02:19.064
[SPEAKER_00]: not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County, when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.

02:19.866 --> 02:29.308
[SPEAKER_00]: The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.

02:30.190 --> 02:35.503
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in

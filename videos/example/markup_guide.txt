[0.03-3.26] SPEAKER_01: there is just a very manual aspect of the program.
[3.8-12.19] SPEAKER_01: And so while we're always looking at things to improve, I do think there would still be some responsibility that would live with the customer.
[14.43-15.05] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
[16.84-17.44] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
[17.46-19.78] SPEAKER_02: And thank you for a very clear presentation.
[19.86-23.61] SPEAKER_02: Although I have one question of clarification.
[23.97-26.71] SPEAKER_02: You talk about mirroring the existing service area.
[27.99-43.02] SPEAKER_02: One of the things that appealed to me about this service was that I don't think that the customers were restricted to the three quarter mile within a fixed route.
[43.72-45.68] SPEAKER_02: Would that change with this?
[45.7-50.53] SPEAKER_02: Any of these proposals or would it still be over the entire RTD service area?
[51.51-60.58] SPEAKER_01: As the pro the proposals are presented, we are proposing mirroring the three quarter of a mile boundary that exists today for our accessory customers.
[64.12-64.68] SPEAKER_02: Okay, that.
[67.31-70.63] SPEAKER_02: That presents some problems for me, but we can talk about that later.
[70.67-71.23] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
[73.47-74.53] SPEAKER_00: Secretary Nicholson.
[76.58-77.98] SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much.
[78.38-85.41] SPEAKER_00: I think I first want to echo and perhaps be a little bit more direct about what Director Catlin said.
[87.47-92.92] SPEAKER_00: We have bus routes in this system that don't qualify for the ADA service, but they're bus routes anyway.
[94.0-96.98] SPEAKER_00: There are commuter routes and I
[97.08-105.54] SPEAKER_00: would not vote personally for a change that would cut off the people who live within three quarters of a mile of those routes.
[105.6-112.04] SPEAKER_00: So at least for me, you guys want to get this through, you're going to need to change that because it's just a matter of basic equity.
[112.08-113.62] SPEAKER_00: Otherwise, Peggy has like
[114.29-118.02] SPEAKER_00: two places in our district that get service and that's just not reasonable.
[118.04-121.17] SPEAKER_00: There are a lot of older folks that live up in those areas.
[122.15-129.35] SPEAKER_00: I think the second issue that I have with what's being proposed is that the needs of
[130.0-139.06] SPEAKER_00: not call it rural, but mountainous Jefferson County, when it comes to AOD are very different than the needs of central Denver.
[139.87-149.31] SPEAKER_00: The trips I can get to most places that I need to go, in terms of grocery stores, medical, et cetera, in a $15 Uber.
[150.19-155.5] SPEAKER_00: I don't think there's anywhere that you can get to for 15 bucks in

77208	79251	However, the public can still offer comments.
79471	82594	Excuse me, does not have a section for public comment this afternoon.
82775	84797	However, the public can still offer comments.
85047	100626	The email or by participating in person or remotely during the regular scheduled meeting, which will be happening later this evening, either at 530 or potentially a little bit later, depending how long our special board meeting happens this afternoon.
101922	102263	All right.
102803	110775	So we have our external entities report and this external entities report will be coming from the joint rail service update for today's special board meeting.
110916	119809	We have just the one and I, and today's special guest is going to be Diane Barrett, special advisor to the governor for joint rail service.
120330	126279	Before I ask Miss Barrett to begin, I would want to offer the floor to GM CEO Johnson for some opening remarks.
127000	128402	Miss Johnson, the floor is yours.
130306	131588	Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
131608	135573	Good afternoon to all board members assembled and those members of the public.
136594	144424	Before we get started, just for a point of clarification, I do know that Lisa Kaufman is present as well, Senior Advisor to the Governor, who will be part of the presentation this afternoon.
144884	150391	I also like to acknowledge Michelle Merch Hutchinson, our Deputy General Counsel, who is sitting in today as General Counsel.
150792	158862	And then more specifically, we have in the audience our Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Mackey, who all formally introduced during the course of the public board meeting,
158842	185119	But for the matter at hand today as it relates to the progress relative to joint service and working with five other entities aside from, of course, ourselves with RTD and coming forward with options relative to bringing passenger rail service to the front range more specifically along the northwest corridor, we have been involved in meetings and working diligently and our colleagues from
185099	187802	the state are here to provide an overview.
188423	198694	With that as a backdrop, there'll be an opportunity whereby this body will go into executive session and we can have a more in-depth discussion pertinent to next steps.
198714	200816	So with that, Mr. Chair, I would ask Ms.
200856	201397	Barrett and Ms.
201457	209665	Kaufman to join us at the U-shaped table for their presentation this afternoon.
209806	210246	Thank you.
235235	235716	Great, Ms.
235756	236296	Barrett and Ms.
236316	237578	Kaufman, thank you for joining us.
237838	238499	The floor is yours.
239981	240782	Thank you very much.
242123	245727	Thank you, General Manager Johnson, for that introduction.
246969	252395	This is my fourth appearance, I believe, with you folks.
253336	256500	So I hope that you're not getting bored with us.
257003	265480	Lisa's going to start us off and we'll go through an overview of where we are and what we've been doing.
266162	274158	And then we'll have a quick overview of the IGA, which you've all been looking at and thinking about for a while.
274819	278607	And then that'll be it.
280493	282436	and questions.
282797	283378	Thanks, Diane.
284399	292873	So I'll get an overview on where we've been to date and what the overall timeline for the project is.
292993	296038	So some background is
297436	301244	SB 184 was signed into law May of 2024.
301885	318820	And in this new law, it created a new congestion fee of $3 a day on daily rental cars, which is estimated to bring in a new $57 million in FY26 before growing to over $110 million by 2050.
318800	334782	And in that law, it directed RTD front-range passenger rail and CDOT to collaborate to deliver on starter service for inner city passenger rail from Denver to Fort Collins by January, 2029.
334963	345297	It allowed the entities to contemplate three different ways to govern this collaborative to deliver passenger rail.
345277	352487	through either an IGA or a new Colorado Rail Authority or an altogether new legal authority.
352507	363302	And what the principles kind of rallied around early on was the concept of an IGA given that all the existing entities had the legal authority they needed to
363282	367508	govern the service and enter into the service through an IGA.
367528	381049	I would say that some previous board members from RTD during the process of this legislation were advocates for the new Colorado Rail Authority as a potential solution.
381369	390283	And that idea still has some merit, but the legislation did not create an appropriation to do a proper study on that concept.
390343	391585	So early on,
391565	402745	That concept was really only given a cursory look as it's a complicated endeavor that would have needed in appropriation to do a full analysis on that concept.
403346	409036	So it's just worth noting it's not that the principles decided that concept was without merit.
409056	415868	It just was something that would have needed far more resources to really explore that as a viable governance option.
418362	426431	Also in last year's legislative session, SP 230 pass, which is a new production fee on oil and gas extraction.
426471	433298	This law is forecasted in its first full year to bring in around $110 million.
434820	444690	The lion share beneficiary will likely be RTD as 70% of it is to go out to local transit agencies for increasing
444670	447857	service and ridership.
448879	461785	That is to go out formulaically 70% of it and then there is a 20% set aside for passenger rail that calls out prioritization for completion of the Northwest Rail and the end line.
465443	470392	This is a project overview for the work around joint service.
471013	477545	So as I just went through, May 2024, SB 184 and SB 230 was signed into law.
478687	483776	In August of 2024, the principles of joint service met.
484016	489426	So general managers from RTD, FRPRD,
489406	505879	director Lou and the governor and decided to bring on the ever-talented Diane Barrett to help lead this project and lead the interagency coordination, you know, part of the reason why
505859	528089	the principles decided to bring on Diane is that one of the most successful collaboratives that the state of Colorado has seen was the renovation and revitalization of Union Station, which required a lot of coordination among many different public entities to come together to come up with the creative financing mechanism to get that done.
528109	532255	And Diane led that project for then Mayor Hickenlooper as the first chief
532235	544202	project officer and so we're very blessed for her to come out of retirement to come lead this and do it again because it is a herculean effort to coordinate this many public entities with their own.
544570	548936	policies, bylaws, and enabling legislation.
549216	563336	And so there really is truly no one better to do this work than Diane, which then led to the March 1st report that had an initial cost estimate in review of available revenue streams and review of governance models.
563777	574071	And so we'll review a little bit of what the March 1st report said, but succinctly it said that there is enough existing resources
574051	578821	And that an IGA is the preferred governance model to deliver joint service.
579983	590946	We have since spent the time since March 1st refining the study and looking at updating the cost estimates based off of the feedback from the March 1st report.
591297	601226	based off of additional feedback from BNSF, and drafting the IGA and doing workshops like we are here today with the governing boards.
601767	610155	So the drafting of the IGA has been led by Diane, but also the general councils from RTD, FRPRD, and the attorney general's office.
611076	617421	And we have now done workshops, including today with all the governing boards.
617662	619043	We expect that
619023	633808	feedback from all of the workshops and the ongoing drafting will continue until about mid June in which we hope to be able to circulate a final draft in mid June for board adoptions this summer in June and July.
638564	661348	So this is a project timeline moving forward and kind of gets at the heart of what is the IGA about, but final steps as I said is to circulate a final draft of the IGA in June and then start operating under the governance of the IGA to speak with one voice in negotiations with BNSF.
661328	675766	with the hope of getting an access agreement with BNSF and be able to then have a finance model based off of the actual cost, based off of the actual infrastructure list negotiated with BNSF.
676487	687100	And that at that point, we would then be asking for boards to adopt financial plans based off of the actual negotiations with BNSF.
687080	701384	and that that would then kick off kind of the procurement for operator and executing of financing any NEPAs that are needed, construction and safety testing with the commencement of service in January, 2029.
701565	712463	One thing I would say about this is I was just the state's chief negotiator for the Union Pacific Access Agreement for Mountain Rail.
712882	721980	which was a good learning experience to understand how those documents answer a lot of the questions that I'm sure you all have on.
722534	727338	How is the infrastructure cost associated with this determined?
727558	728639	What's the timeline?
728699	729680	Who does the work?
729740	733284	How is it going to proceed?
733344	739029	And so that access agreement is foundational to any project for passenger rail.
739869	751900	And what we have heard loud and clear from BNSF is that the need for joint service is because right now absent having an IGA
751880	756330	This says we're going to deliver passenger rail on the northern sub collaboratively.
756370	770462	There is multiple different public agencies that are planning passenger rail projects on the northern sub that they own from from Denver Union Station to Fort Collins and that if those projects were to proceed in a silo.
770780	779613	That adds a level of complexity and conflict with freight operations that would have a cost estimate impact to all projects.
780675	799183	So to put that more succinctly, if Front Range Passenger Rail were to price out their project right now, BNSF would assume the infrastructure needs for Northwest Rail in addition to Front Range Passenger Rail, which would balloon the cost for Front Range Passenger Rail.
799535	802519	as there are multiple passenger rail systems planned.
803020	829035	And so the interagency agreement is designed to really say that the public agencies are going to work together to get one access agreement and have one operator to create that efficiencies for both the taxpayer and fee payers that would be funding the service, but also to reduce any conflict with freight operations, both from a safety perspective, but also from a
829252	830674	freight business perspective.
831255	835700	And so the goal of the IGA is to say this is how we will work together.
835760	851421	Here's the core principles of the collaborative and be able to go speak with one voice in those negotiations with BNSF so that we can get the most cost efficient passenger rail system on the northern front range.
855106	859191	That I think I turn it over to Diane to go over key takeaways from the March 1st report.
864132	864773	Thank you, Lisa.
867998	879137	From the March 1st report, or by the time of the March 1st report, we had learned that there are enough existing resources
879472	892347	from the concession impact fee and the production fee in SB 184 and SB 230 and RTD sales tax to cover the cost of three daily round trips.
893008	897273	Remember that we were asked to look at three and five round trips.
899055	904622	Any appropriation made by any of the parties, i.e.
904662	905563	the agencies,
905965	912692	is subject to policy and decision, budget decisions of the governing boards.
912712	915775	Something for you all specifically to keep in mind.
918417	928187	General Manager Johnson will be coming to you for your prior approval before any action is taken.
929948	935854	Three daily round trips is estimated to cost $83 million in the first year of operations.
936070	943817	32 million of that is O&M plus 51 million in debt service.
943837	950524	We will be updating those numbers, which are the same numbers you saw the last two times I was here, I believe.
951385	954207	We'll be updating those in the next coming weeks.
954568	964137	And in our June presentation to you, we will have very interesting new numbers to show you.
966293	979196	If the state contributes $42 million annually from 230 and 184 numbers, there is a gap of $41 million to be filled by RTD.
982903	989415	The peak rail study that you folks did at great costs recently,
989665	994192	And by the way, we are using data from that report constantly.
994652	1000020	It's been a tremendous boon to joint service to have that study in place.
1000220	1001763	So you should be proud of that.
1002984	1013800	Anyway, three trains from Denver to only to Longmont is said to be 52 to $56 million annually for you by yourselves.
1015518	1031687	So 41 million is significantly less than that, and the service would be connecting twice the amount of population that would be going to Fort Collins rather than just to Longmont.
1031707	1040462	Nearly all of the infrastructure investments for the joint service that we're planning would benefit the eventual front-range passenger rail.
1042889	1062750	Further study is needed to define the service, negotiate an access agreement with BNSF, develop an internet agency agreement, and importantly, a financial plan that will work.
1062770	1065713	Why did we decide to do an intergovernmental agreement?
1066193	1072440	The remaining choice, you heard from Lisa earlier, was really
1072825	1076490	establishing a new entity, a new public entity.
1077771	1079994	That's what we did in Denver Union Station.
1080074	1083739	And we did it there for various reasons.
1085661	1088405	It was kind of a first shot out of the box.
1088945	1091008	And we did it.
1091308	1091569	Ms.
1091609	1094032	Catlin sat on our original board.
1094092	1101381	So we did feel that after the fact,
1101715	1103838	probably could have done it with an IGA.
1105720	1107422	It was a big complication.
1108884	1123042	But we decided in this instance that the agencies were familiar enough with each other that we could probably do this with an intergovernmental agreement, less expense, less time.
1124023	1131452	And we think that we will have a binding agreement that can be to everybody's benefit.
1136714	1147946	So we decided that we would have the collaboration that we need and be able to establish a governance process.
1150369	1154013	We didn't really need a lot more than that to get started.
1154614	1157397	So remember what we're doing is a starter service.
1159039	1164865	So the IGA creates a joint service executive oversight committee, JSEOC.
1165537	1167439	that acts on behalf of the group.
1170121	1175305	And remember that the group is the executives of each of the agencies.
1175325	1180449	So the group is General Manager Johnson.
1181230	1183072	It's hard not to say Deborah, sorry.
1184213	1189157	And our president, Bouquet.
1189197	1195442	Sure.
1196570	1203918	Actually, the executives are the voting body, though.
1203958	1204419	I'm sorry.
1204739	1207863	I'm thinking of our principles meetings in which you attend.
1208804	1212308	And so does the board chair of FRPRD.
1213289	1225783	But the voting members of the JSEOC are General Manager Johnson, Interim General Manager Chrissy Bright at FRPRD,
1225814	1238269	the executive of CTIO, the executive of CTE, and Shoshana Liu, or her delegate, and the governor, or his delegate, which is Lisa.
1241633	1250003	The JSEOC becomes the single entity that BNSF has been asking for all along.
1251265	1255450	He wants one neck to choke, I guess.
1255615	1256976	You can think about that.
1259059	1264504	The IGA does not supersede or impact the authority of any body.
1264684	1267888	So all of the boards act just as they always have.
1268348	1278138	You will continue to have the control that you want and need in order to fulfill your obligations fiduciarily and otherwise.
1280801	1285386	The boards will make all decisions regarding appropriations, budgeting,
1285636	1296653	funding unless those decisions have been expressly dedicated by the individual governing body to someone, for instance, your general manager.
1300379	1310715	It is expected that the JSEOC will make the decisions that they make by a measure of 50% plus one.
1312012	1317500	which, so you don't have to do the arithmetic, is a vote of four to prevail.
1321465	1340652	Upon an adoption of the financial plan, and this is at the end of, at the conclusion of a successful negotiation with BNSF, when we have learned what the real costs are of this project, and we have learned how big your financial
1341172	1345378	contributions will be, and that financial plan will be adopted.
1345919	1367069	And after that, all voting will be majority, just a majority vote, unless and until one person or more than one choose to ask for a weighted vote.
1367650	1370554	This is not a sure thing, but today,
1370838	1377768	We are still carrying a weighted vote opportunity after the adoption of the financial plan.
1379010	1383937	If one of the members asks for a weighted vote, that will happen.
1383957	1389485	And the weighting is as of the contributions of the parties.
1390847	1399579	And contributions, of course, will be carefully, carefully defined and is still a very open
1399964	1401406	definition in the documents.
1406894	1419271	So sorry, thank you, Lisa.
1419331	1428604	The JSEOC will steer the negotiations with BNSF will be responsible for soliciting an operator for the passenger rail service.
1429242	1435309	And they will be laying the foundation for the future expansion of the Front Range Passenger Rail District.
1436250	1450046	The JSEOC will strive to implement the joint service project in such a way that it will not render infeasible the existing operations of RTD or the future plans for the Front Range Passenger Rail District.
1450727	1452229	That sounds very legal.
1452918	1455221	and a little bit hard to operate with.
1455462	1475470	So we're looking at that language and trying hard to come up with a language that will assure that the front-range passenger rail is not impeded in the future by what we're doing with our project, with the small starter project that we're working on today.
1475510	1481018	The IGA also provides a process for transfer
1482078	1490028	of interests, assets, and obligations of one of the parties to others or to outsiders as well.
1491329	1507929	This is a process that, again, is still under discussion and redrafting to try to make it a fair way to transfer if such transfer is wanted.
1510392	1512034	It actually is important
1512419	1525739	In order to assure that in the event of a need to break up the partnership, we have an orderly process in place that will help that happen.
1527301	1541042	There are many instances of large groups of participants who end up not being able to make work, and it's best to have a process in place in the original agreement if possible.
1543756	1553147	So our timeline in May, just barely, we managed to get the workshops all done with parties.
1554188	1566963	In June, we'll do another RTD board update and that one will entail some specificity about dollars and cents that we don't have quite yet.
1567664	1572970	And certainly it will lead us on the pathway to negotiations with BNSF
1573270	1581942	which obviously have to occur and conclude before we will know what the financial picture really is and adopt a financial plan for the project.
1583204	1589453	June and July, the boards begin voting and approving the IGA.
1589993	1600428	So in June, the CTIO, the CTE and the Transportation Commission will all have their opportunity to approve the IGA.
1601149	1602771	In June, the FRPRD
1603105	1606308	will have their opportunity to approve the IGA.
1606669	1610392	And then in July, you folks will have your opportunity to do the same.
1611674	1612635	You get to be last.
1615878	1621604	Through the winter, all the boards will work to adopt the financial plan.
1622344	1629772	Again, the negotiations with BNSF are critical and key here, and those have to be ongoing.
1630492	1633095	And we hope that during the winter,
1633683	1643454	all the boards will be able to adopt a financial plan that's based on the successful access agreement and construction agreements that we've achieved with BNSF.
1644696	1652264	The summer of next year, the JSEOC will conduct procurement for rolling stock and for the operator.
1652304	1659593	And then in January of 2029, joint service train begins.
1660934	1662576	That's, you know,
1663045	1665668	tomorrow in the right in the train world.
1666989	1669612	So optimistic, aggressive.
1670893	1671094	Yes.
1672035	1672795	All opposed.
1673536	1677260	Just real quick as a correction, Miss Barrett, it says winner of 2026 on there.
1677440	1682125	I believe it is winner of 2025 all boards to adopt financial plan.
1684448	1684748	Yes.
1686110	1689653	Could expand the year 26th in January.
1689754	1690875	Okay.
1690895	1691095	Thank you.
1694197	1695939	But hopefully, before that.
1695959	1698563	Thank you, Chairman Burkay.
1699884	1702288	So in the June board update, what will I do?
1703249	1713402	Just another boring turnout, but we'll have sent out the finalized IGA draft on all board workshops.
1715284	1719049	The new cost estimate by HNTB will be presented.
1719470	1720872	It's very interesting.
1721132	1723495	We have looked in all
1723660	1727705	the couch covers, and we have found many pennies.
1728365	1731849	So we're going to be showing you some new numbers.
1733491	1737316	There'll be a new financial scenario based on those new cost estimates.
1738457	1748449	And this time we'll include Fairbox collections because we will have ridership scenarios by that time for you, which I'm sure will be very interested to all of you.
1749049	1752233	The ridership model is completed and we'll be able to present it to you.
1752905	1761377	And then we'll have an operations report that will provide analyses financially and operationally to date.
1764381	1769188	So I believe that that's it for our report.
1769609	1773775	And we'd be pleased to take your question.
1773795	1774195	Excellent.
1774275	1777280	Well, thank you both for coming in and joining us again.
1777320	1781005	We greatly appreciate it and greatly appreciate your guys' time.
1781238	1786150	Um, so now I'm going to leave it up to the board if they have any questions for the two of you.
1786652	1787855	So.
1787875	1789699	Are there any, uh, directors who have questions?
1791303	1792767	Uh, uh, treasure banker.
1796054	1798136	Well, first of all, thank you for coming again.
1800179	1809149	You've been doing Yeoman's work here and providing leadership on this project, which is extremely valuable and appreciated.
1809169	1813314	I do have a couple of questions.
1813414	1814215	Actually, I've got many.
1814395	1815396	I'll keep it short though.
1817578	1824226	When you talk about a weighted vote for this joint operating agreement, could you give me an example?
1824326	1825167	How would that work?
1828032	1837742	Well, Lisa will chip in afterwards.
1837762	1851435	A weighted vote would give more weight to a vote by a party that has contributed more than another party.
1852116	1857381	So the definition of contributions is being heavily debated.
1857732	1870572	among the council guided by their principles, of course, and there are lots of different ideas about how to do that.
1871714	1874458	For instance, we had in one draft
1874860	1896025	the specifics of the peak rail study as having been an expenditure that RTD would get credited with because it was huge amount of money, I think, $8 million or something like that, as you all know better than I do, and the BNSF study.
1896426	1903534	So wanting to make sure that that was included in contributions and
1903818	1906942	It was suggested, I think, from your council.
1907483	1918078	And we were talking about it behind the scenes, and we said, well, you know, we don't want everybody putting in every example of every time they spent money and so forth.
1918138	1926571	And so we'll just say by example, we won't say by example, we'll just say, here's the definition of what a contribution is.
1927372	1933200	It became clear to us that we specifically wanted to delineate
1933754	1942382	the peak study because, A, it was unique among other studies and expanditures that people have made.
1942442	1958397	But we still don't want to enumerate every single expenditure, but we're going to put that one in specifically because it was large and it was important throughout our studies and will continue to be.
1959198	1963542	So contributions is a financial contribution
1963927	1973176	that, again, the definition will be further refined as we talk more.
1973196	1974938	Mr. Chair, if I could continue.
1975319	1985229	Then how would you, something to think about, you don't have to answer it right now, but there very well may be one-time contributions that are made, as well as annual contributions that are made.
1985809	1991335	So, however, that is calculated, hopefully, that is taken into consideration.
1991872	2008176	Well, the amounts, total and integral, would be heavily a part of the amount itself is a very important part of the analysis.
2009137	2013123	And then one more question, then, if you don't mind, Mr. Chairman.
2013143	2014185	Yeah, Treasurer.
2014205	2017069	A total contribution
2018905	2028386	Director Banker, a total contribution would be even if you were paying it over time, the total contribution would be what you would be.
2029088	2034720	So if there was a bond then you would calculate the 30-year payment of a bond?
2034886	2040775	as well as one time deposit shall we say at the beginning of the project.
2040795	2041095	Yes.
2041115	2041416	Okay.
2041576	2041997	Interesting.
2042477	2046023	You had mentioned that you're talking between three and five trips a day.
2046063	2051150	How are you, where are we in the potential of five trips?
2054675	2056438	I'm going to ask Lisa to take that one.
2057633	2063538	Yeah, so I think there was an updated cost estimate that looked at the five round trips.
2063919	2073768	And I think that it's really kind of on the bubble if there is enough existing resources at this point to pursue five round trips.
2073868	2077591	And so we've really been focusing on the three daily round trips.
2078051	2087640	It's also been, you know, an active dialogue with BNSF and they certainly would prefer that any inter-esency agreement
2087620	2102710	be prioritizing starting off at two to three round trips with the expectation that you would increase frequency as new resources became available and as the service was successful and operating on their line.
2102690	2106998	with the existing infrastructure dictated in the access agreement.
2107599	2113911	And so it's not envisioned that you would end with that amount of frequency, but that that's where your starting point is.
2114092	2123770	And as you might know, FRPRD is currently doing open houses and workshops on their alternative analysis.
2123750	2132503	And part of the alternative analysis for Front Range Passenger Rail is a benchmark study of all inner city passenger rail services in the country.
2132543	2137170	And what they looked at was where do they start and where do they kind of top out.
2137410	2141016	And what you find is a lot start with two to three round trips.
2141476	2149268	And then the kind of high level is, you know, between 12 and 16 round trips for inner city passenger rail.
2149535	2173534	And so that is kind of the range in which we would expect to try to reach eventually with ridership demand being built up and with added capacity on the line to accommodate new frequency is certainly all the states hope that front range passenger rail eventually goes to the ballot and is successful so that we can increase frequency with new resources that they bring to the table.
2175893	2176475	Thank you, Treasurer.
2177638	2186945	Prior to recognizing First Vice Chair O'Keefe, I do want to make note that at round 340, Director of Music and Director Roosia did join us online.
2187186	2187487	Thank you.
2187728	2188570	First Vice Chair O'Keefe.
2189630	2194976	Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I will note that Director Buzyk put his hand up as soon as he got on the call.
2195156	2197158	He didn't even know we were debating at this time.
2200542	2201984	Just like the talk.
2202064	2202785	Or something.
2204386	2207510	So good to see you, Diane, Ms.
2207550	2208311	Barrett.
2209572	2218422	You know what they call going to the same body four times and not getting what they call the body that you go to four times and don't get a yes, parole board.
2218739	2221722	So you're coming to the parole board.
2223363	2231891	So a couple things that actually the previous question when we think of it, is there a minimum contribution?
2232772	2238297	So if an entity doesn't give any money, or do they get no vote when you go to a waiting vote?
2245163	2245444	OK.
2246124	2246685	Oh, I see.
2246705	2246805	Yeah.
2249097	2250401	I'm not generally quiet.
2250562	2250842	So.
2251284	2253049	So could you repeat that real quick?
2253130	2257403	Explain, explain how that would work.
2258783	2259224	I'm sorry.
2259404	2260145	How would that work?
2260265	2274168	So if you, if you're prorating, if you're prorating out based on contribution, but there are entities that don't give anything, do you give them, do they get a minimum like 10% vote or what's the idea on the weighting?
2274448	2278735	And it, it, it will matter more in construction than.
2278756	2279557	Right.
2279577	2284605	So I mean, I'm particularly interested in if we're going to wait, waiting it correctly.
2285362	2297093	Well, and that's why we're struggling with the language of both the definition of contributions and with how the actual weighted works.
2297574	2303459	So there is no thought of taking away a vote.
2303479	2306623	So each of the six has a vote.
2306643	2314390	And for most actions that will be taken, everybody's vote will
2314673	2315514	will be the same.
2316335	2333361	After the adoption of the finance plan and when we're actually, you know, creating a project that has a cost and a budget and is sticking with all of that, then most votes will be one vote one person.
2334723	2342014	But if we have to go to a weighted vote, the amount of
2344070	2350199	votes will increase by the contribution levels.
2350520	2352703	Can I maybe jump in with an example of this?
2352723	2360414	So I think the current way that IJ has contemplated it is the bodies would govern with 50% plus one.
2360434	2367505	And that would be, you know, the governing rules through negotiations with BNSF to get to an access agreement.
2367785	2372372	Then a finance plan would come out of the access agreement based off of
2372774	2377460	actually having an infrastructure project list and more solid numbers.
2378121	2385050	An instance in where you might want a weighted vote is, you know, say the service is in operation for three years.
2385711	2396144	And we think that it's worth having a discussion on adding a siding because it might improve performance and, you know, being on time performance.
2396444	2402292	You would presume that the entities would then vote through 50% plus one.
2402272	2409343	But somebody could ask for a weighted vote on that decision based off of contributions.
2409423	2415012	It's designed to give an added layer of protection for the entities that are contributing large amounts.
2415593	2425528	But of course, there's another layer of protection for the agencies that are contributing to the service because all of those appropriations still have to be appropriated by
2425778	2434774	the originating board and nobody could be forced by the interagency agreement to appropriate any money for the service.
2435315	2441386	And so it's just an added layer of protection for the entities that have the most equity into the service.
2442388	2449761	But I think that in practice what we expect to see is that the majority rule would be how decisions are made.
2450045	2450967	I would hope so.
2451047	2455396	But if you need to go to a weighted vote, things aren't going well.
2455516	2459303	So I think you may want to war game out how that would work.
2459364	2462610	And so just a couple of things.
2463131	2464594	Can we get a copy of the IGA?
2467561	2470324	I've asked just about everybody.
2470344	2472066	I almost asked a guy out on the street.
2472127	2473108	I might have it.
2474029	2486524	So I looked at general manager Johnson, but my understanding was that the general councils for each agency was sharing with their governing boards to protect client privilege.
2487145	2493973	So I don't know where that maybe got lost in translation, but
2493953	2501660	That's how we've done it, at least in the executive branch, where each Attorney General assigned to each agency has shared it with those boards.
2501680	2502201	That's perfect.
2502241	2503502	She just gave me the answer.
2504283	2506465	She didn't even have to leer at me.
2508887	2517295	So the only other things, and I think this is important to at least start talking about in the context of the IGA.
2517315	2521058	I understand the IGA is not designed to set a budget request.
2521038	2528586	But I do think it should set parameters that under no circumstances a board would support.
2528646	2534713	So we have to decide voting ourselves what is something we would not accept.
2534733	2538317	And I'll give you two examples that I will specifically ask for.
2538357	2543603	First, who's the backstop if it goes over?
2544528	2555702	If, and I know it'll shock people for me to think that a rail project might be over budget, but just in case we found one that does, who pays?
2555902	2557645	And at what percentage?
2558086	2563898	And I think that's really important going into negotiations with BNSF because that's going to be your biggest expenditure.
2563918	2570311	And they need to, people should know their negotiating position before they go in with BNSF.
2570411	2572535	And I think that helps the negotiators.
2572656	2575902	It's also helpful that the board say, look,
2575882	2585153	under no circumstances and with a backstop, we will give you the amount of money in the agreement and no more, or we will give you more and this is what our percentage looks like.
2585233	2586815	I think that's really, really important.
2587376	2597509	The second thing is, and this is like a cut and dry issue for me, under no circumstances can all the FISA money go to this project.
2597529	2604437	There are several unfinished projects in fast tracks and there are a lot of disappointed voters.
2604417	2610626	And I'm not saying it has to be counted out percentage-wise to the penny.
2610666	2617076	There certainly could be greater weighting to this project because it actually has a greater chance of going forward.
2617637	2631538	But under no circumstances would I vote for anything that takes the vast preponderance of the FISA money because I probably wouldn't make it back across the Douglas County line alive.
2631518	2639146	So that's just, I think those parameters that we can start to stake out for you before we vote would be really helpful.
2639607	2642610	So the negotiators aren't left in a tough position.
2642870	2644252	Sorry, Mr. Chair.
2644272	2646054	Can I react to that?
2646274	2654923	So the goal would be that the access agreement would have an infrastructure list that corresponds with, you know, the daily round trips, right?
2654983	2661070	So it might be that for instance, if you want it five daily round trips,
2661320	2663925	that that would require seven new sightings.
2664546	2674624	And then what the finance plan would then say is here are the sightings that are needed in order to accommodate the five daily round trips.
2675185	2677729	Here are the ones that are in the RTD region.
2677889	2679292	Here are the ones that are out.
2680173	2684982	And then that finance plan would be what came back, you know, next winter.
2685232	2709045	to say here's kind of the pieces of who's going to finance what and then to your point then if any one project goes over what does that look like and how do you handle any overtures but it would be what our anticipation based off of the current cost estimates right is if we're negotiating for two or three daily round trips with them is that there is
2709025	2712409	that infrastructure cost associated with it.
2712529	2719558	We have some ideas of what those are based off of the RTC modeling that was done ahead of the March 1st report.
2719618	2725685	And the RTC model is based off of the business data provided under an NDA from BNSF.
2725705	2729210	So it's a very informed cost estimate.
2729350	2735337	What is coming back to you in June is since then we've gotten
2735317	2740224	We've passed review at the FRA under the new administration for the Chrissy grant.
2740304	2745711	So we know that those costs are going to be covered now through that Chrissy grant.
2745731	2748575	So those kind of refinements is coming back.
2749336	2759890	But really that finance plan has to be based off of the actual agreement with BNSF for the actual projects and then understanding how that each one of those gets financed is what we anticipate.
2760629	2762876	I appreciate all that.
2762896	2763658	That really helps.
2764621	2773407	I guess the challenge is there's a finite amount that we would chip in, and I don't know what that is yet.
2774011	2776874	that would be the only money coming from this body.
2776894	2793733	I don't think that there's, I mean, I could almost get an informal vote right now that we would enter an agreement where we did not know what our obligation was and did not know who was responsible when we exceeded that original budget.
2794233	2800120	It might be us, that's fine, but we need to delineate who's what and
2800690	2805986	the railroad negotiation will be murkier than we want this.
2807852	2808012	Ms.
2808032	2813890	Barrett and I have done one railroad negotiation before and everything is
2814359	2821336	tied together in some sort of safety plan, they rarely will say, this siding is the responsibility of this customer.
2821937	2830959	It's all, they're very good at creating a mismatch of requirements and costs.
2830979	2832402	In fact, there are experts at it.
2833765	2850745	Yeah, I would say that our hope is that it's enumerated in the agreement and in the mountain rail access agreement that we just completed on May 1 it is all enumerated for the project by segment and which phase that you run does it trigger the need for that infrastructure.
2850725	2855633	So I think our hope is that we would be able to accomplish that same sort of format that we just did.
2855653	2872699	I would say on your other feedback on finished fast tracks projects, I mean, I think that it's hopefully clear to all, if not maybe worth stating that certainly we would like to partner to finish all of them and to bring state resources to partner to finish all of them.
2873050	2889253	It is called out in Senate Bill SB 230 that the rail set aside is for both Northwest Rail and the online and I think that the hope is that we can get some clarity on where the communities are on the
2889689	2896658	Southwest extension and the five points project to understand how the state could also partner on those.
2897739	2912617	So it's probably worth me stating that on the mic is that the state wants to partner to finish all on finished fast tracks projects as we see this out there as a threat to voter confidence for us to get to where we want to go on our climate goals.
2914259	2915421	Thank you first finance chair Keith.
2916402	2917283	Director music.
2919946	2920547	Thank you very much.
2920647	2922009	And again, thank you to Ms.
2922029	2923131	Coppin and Ms.
2923151	2927237	Barrett for once again, coming in and giving us an update.
2927438	2929301	I've got one question and two comments.
2929361	2938114	And my first, the question has to do with SB 230 and that set aside, that 20% set aside for Northwest Rail and the end line.
2938134	2947489	And I just don't remember, does the legislation determine the proportion that those lines share that 20% or not?
2948650	2950292	Anybody can answer that that might know.
2950893	2951573	It does not.
2952094	2957661	Um, it just calls out prioritizing that, uh, 20% set aside for those two projects.
2958121	2976042	And so in the first report, what we did was for just, um, the exercise of trying to identify, is there enough on allocated resources to cover the cost was to just assume a 50 50 split, but that is, um, a decision that the clean transit enterprise board needs to make.
2977726	2980230	Okay, so that's the entity that would make that decision.
2983355	2990026	Okay, yeah, I just would not want to see the end line swept away to put all the money into this project.
2990066	2995594	So the other comments, and it's been touched on, and I have more things, but we'll bring this up in executive session.
2995635	2997077	I think it's more appropriate for that.
2997097	3004729	But the access agreement of BNSF, are you going to negotiate
3005266	3014535	the cost of increased frequency, because I can see them saying, listen, when you guys are ready to go to nine or 10 or 12 trips a day, come on back and we'll talk.
3015496	3016617	And then, then they've got you.
3016637	3027248	So hopefully we can get some incremental increase amounts or prices or cost worked into that access agreement, because I can see that coming back to bite us if we don't.
3027809	3031172	And last but not least, I mentioned all along,
3031523	3039610	You know, we did that peak service rail study and the per rider subsidy.
3039843	3041725	number scary.
3042346	3049534	So hopefully now I've heard allusion to basically doubling the population that this line can serve.
3049574	3052257	And hopefully with that, we'll bring that number down.
3052277	3061268	I'm still hoping to see an update on ridership projections on this whole line and what that does to the per rider subsidy.
3061448	3062329	And that's all I have for now.
3062349	3063630	But I'm looking forward to it.
3064171	3064692	I said it once.
3064732	3065252	I said it again.
3065292	3067515	This is the only way we're getting rail up there.
3067535	3068296	And I hope we do it.
3068636	3069377	So thanks a lot.
3070218	3070599	Thank you.
3070619	3072102	Thank you director.
3073003	3093542	One thing I would just react to of the overall cost per rider and you know this is an unfortunate fact for this line but the single biggest infrastructure cost for this line is to add positive train control from Westminster to Fort Collins and this is a basic safety system that you would hope
3093944	3109623	was on an existing freight line that is moving all sorts of petrochemicals and hazardous on freight through our northern suburbs today, but it's not mandated for them to move those freight products today.
3109663	3113008	It's only mandated when you add passenger rail onto the line.
3113648	3123040	And so when you look at the cost, a lot of it is driven by the need for positive train control, which is a significant improvement to safety for those communities
3123340	3127245	that I would love to see today, but it's regulated at the federal level.
3127305	3129067	We can't regulate it at the state level.
3129668	3151575	It is a big part of the Chrissy Grant is extending positive train control up to Broomfield, and it's a service, I think, to safety to all of us to invest in getting positive train control on this line for freight operations, which is why we were able to successfully partner with BNSF to get that Chrissy Grant, and the way that that worked
3151994	3165237	was we took the engineering work and the study done through the peak rail study and we were able to utilize that engineering work in order to put in a Chrissy grant that was, you know, close to shovel ready.
3165297	3175555	So it was a great return on your investment for peak rail that we were able to secure over $90 million investment that is a safety feature that is needed today.
3176007	3177949	whether or not we ever put a passenger on it.
3178009	3190302	So it's a little bit of a misnomer when you look at the cost that we're kind of bearing the full cost of needing a basic safety feature that we should all want to have on there today for freight operations.
3192043	3192424	Thank you.
3193685	3194266	Director Catlin.
3196948	3197389	Thank you.
3198050	3201373	And I have, I have a lot of questions.
3203412	3209719	But I met five years ago, along with our engineering staff down in Fort Worth with the BNSF.
3210420	3217548	And at that time, to Director O'Keefe's point, with the railroads, it's a moving target.
3218590	3223716	And have they reviewed these costs independently?
3223756	3225758	That's question number one.
3227324	3229206	So they've seen our presentation.
3229247	3239120	Um, they haven't done a verification process, but they also, um, agree directionally with where we've been on our costs.
3239981	3254580	Um, I think that they would say is, you know, through negotiations, if we were willing to agree with a lower frequency for starting, that the cost could actually probably go further down than where we are today, but that is for negotiations with them.
3255472	3257395	And you brought up a good point.
3257495	3268732	I just know that when we were talking about the peak rail study, we had to pay the railroad for them to do the cost estimate.
3268972	3274301	And so I just wanted the board to be aware of that.
3275943	3283234	The next thing, when you talk about increased frequencies, and I remember that was a sticking point during those preliminary discussions,
3283636	3284658	there has to be a ceiling.
3284978	3289826	I mean, they're beyond which their operations couldn't support additional frequencies.
3290306	3293431	And has that been discussed or called out?
3296856	3304408	I think that there's a ceiling before you get to having to double track significant mileage is maybe what you're asking.
3304448	3312040	And I think this is included in the full build out for front range passenger rails alternative analysis that kind of goes through
3312020	3320133	Based off of the RTC modeling done for them, when you trigger additional sidings or double tracking, need it.
3320314	3325061	So that is in the service development plan for Front Range Passenger Rail.
3325723	3334517	And it's based off of BNSF's business data, both for operations today and their forecasted operations for the future.
3334497	3359744	So this was something that was a new process really came out of, you know, kind of the missteps of California high speed rail of not really having this modeling done on the front end and also not having the business case for rail operations done on the front end and really just waiting for a NEPA process before you get to any of those processes.
3359844	3362867	So when IHA passed, they created this new
3363202	3371616	process for these service development plans that is a federal document that goes through each step of this that Front Range passenger rail is currently doing.
3372037	3375983	And we're actually the first rail project in the country that is this far ahead with it.
3376103	3386661	And so there was a period of time where we were stalled a little bit because we were the first to enter into NDAs with the class one railroads to get their business data in
3386962	3394775	to inform our RTC modeling, and that is now we have the the NDAs done.
3394815	3405814	The RTC modeling is undergoing for all of those increased frequencies, and the RTC model then tells you what all of the infrastructure improvements are based off of those frequencies.
3406705	3407146	Well, good.
3407306	3411254	Um, I want to say that they're usually pretty stingy with their data.
3411314	3413478	So could be well for, for getting that.
3413759	3414240	Pick a while.
3414881	3417867	You brought something else up and that's the NEPA process.
3418668	3424680	And pardon me, I'm dusting off the cobwebs from years ago, but, um, there's a,
3425234	3434022	a process for approving fixed rail in through the doctor called process, I think it's called Senate bill 208.
3435183	3435644	Is that right?
3436044	3437145	I don't know.
3437165	3438887	Yes, okay.
3438907	3443011	And are we going to be needing to go through that process.
3445834	3451579	For this as well, even though the project limits extend beyond the doctor called region.
3453365	3457113	You know, it's a good question that I don't have a complete resolution on.
3457133	3466091	We've had conversations with Dr. Cog leadership on this and they aren't clear either if this project would be subject to it.
3466211	3471762	I believe Northwest Rail has already been approved by them and is there underlying.
3471742	3500128	as part of fast tracks it was right and so it's unclear because this is you know a slight modification and it extends beyond their borders um so it is an outstanding question i have into the attorney general's office on it and you know maybe we need some cleanup legislation to clarify that too it's unclear just needs some clarity on it i think yep um and i i had one more thought that i guess it can wait
3501155	3503880	lost my train of thought on that one.
3503900	3504561	Pardon the pun.
3504901	3506724	But thank you all for your hard work.
3507105	3511032	I'm sure we'll have more questions as time goes on, but I appreciate it.
3511472	3511813	Thank you.
3512935	3513997	Thank you, Director Katelyn.
3514297	3515720	I have three directors in the queue.
3515980	3518404	I have Secretary Nicholson next.
3520105	3522267	Thank you very much, Chair Bouquet.
3522727	3528833	I actually have a question for staff before I ask questions of our lovely guests.
3529373	3544086	And the first, the question is, I know there's a provision either in the RTD Act or in our bylaws that requires a super majority of the board to approve any new rail projects is my understanding.
3544407	3548070	So would this require the,
3548050	3555338	eventual agreement, would that require 10 votes from us or would it only require eight votes from us?
3558883	3559083	Ms.
3559423	3559744	Johnson.
3560124	3560264	Yes.
3560304	3562387	Thank you very much, Secretary Nicholson for the question.
3562407	3565931	I believe General Counsel Snyder issued an opinion on that previously.
3566351	3568193	And so we will recirculate that document.
3568414	3568774	Thank you.
3570796	3570937	Okay.
3570997	3571738	Appreciate that.
3573299	3577264	The second, so now switching over to our wonderful guests.
3577565	3578747	I have two questions.
3578787	3596552	The first one, given that this service doesn't happen without RTD's substantial financial contribution, why shouldn't we get a veto over any JSEOC decision if you eventually need to get our approval and our money to make this happen?
3600127	3612229	Well, I think you essentially do because it still has to originate from you appropriating monies or entering into any contract that RTD would enter into.
3612580	3640849	what the Joint Executive Committee would do would be kind of the day-to-day manager of the negotiations with BNSF or any day-to-day management of a selected operator, but any major decision that impacted the ability to actually implement the project would still have to be decided upon by the RTD Board.
3642500	3642761	Thanks.
3642781	3660536	Yeah, to be clear, I was talking about a veto by our person on the JSEOC over a decision by the JSEOC, because again, without our 40 million a year or whatever it ends up being, the train doesn't happen was essentially my question.
3660596	3661919	And I guess I'll just leave that out there.
3662260	3663883	Second question.
3665146	3665868	Forgive me for this.
3666450	3671546	There's an internet meme about a relationship between a man and a woman in a relationship about to be intimate.
3671586	3676641	And the caption reads, aren't you forgetting someone with a picture of Jesus off to the side?
3676823	3698427	I mentioned this because reading over the timeline, there's a lot of mentions of RTD and CTIO and the governor, but it seems like there's no time built in after the finalization of the financial plan to go to the public and ask the voters and talk to the voters and present to the voters about what we're doing, what it costs, and why we should do it in the first place.
3698778	3704486	So my question to you is basically why shouldn't we bake in time to do a real road show of this project?
3704846	3709913	Why shouldn't the governor go to places and present on this train that he wants?
3709994	3724093	Why shouldn't we go and present on these things before we take a massive history defining vote on this item and allocate hundreds of millions of dollars of the public's money?
3724073	3728999	It seems like you don't want that to happen, or you would have put time for it in the schedule.
3729019	3731009	And I'm curious whether I'm reading that correctly.
3731049	3731974	Thanks.
3733844	3739256	Yeah, I would say that throughout this whole process, we are doing significant public engagement.
3739276	3748275	I know I personally do, you know, a lot of presentations to a lot of different community members.
3748396	3754148	So presenting to city councils along the corridor, the general public,
3754128	3759578	Um, so there is inherently baked into the project a lot of community engagement.
3759758	3762283	It's just not enumerated in these slides.
3762363	3765308	These slides were more of an overview of what the project is.
3765809	3770798	But I would also say that, you know, clearly the public has voted in fast tracks in 04.
3770938	3777570	They voted when they elected their representatives in the General Assembly that passed these bills.
3777550	3790805	Um, and, um, there is inherent built into this community engagement that we just didn't add to the slides, but we certainly can give you, um, a report on all of the public engagement to date.
3790845	3799134	It's actually a pretty long section in the March 1st report on all of the community engagement that happened in the lead up to the March 1st report.
3799815	3802478	I would anticipate we would have a similar one in the June report.
3802818	3803038	Yeah.
3803338	3806562	And actually there was one in the 30 September as well.
3806980	3820602	Um, so all the reports that we've put out and the one that we would is coming, uh, contain lists of who we've talked to, um, and generally speaking in, in what venues secretary.
3821813	3826900	Just very quickly, I mean, I'm a pretty engaged guy in Denver, in central Denver.
3827421	3832489	Have you guys done any presentations, public presentations in my district?
3832509	3844446	Have you done any kind of, you know, when we've done big changes, when we've talked about BRT, we do big roadhouse presentations, we bring the public in, you know, it's in the news, it's on our website.
3844426	3846870	I read the post practically every day.
3846931	3847912	Most of my friends do.
3848293	3849736	I go on Reddit on a regular basis.
3849756	3850557	I answer questions there.
3850577	3851739	I haven't seen you guys on there.
3852220	3857330	I haven't seen literally any big public events about this project, explaining it to people.
3857350	3859794	I've seen one article about, hey, this is coming.
3859834	3861637	The train's coming sooner than you expected it would.
3862058	3864122	That's all anybody in my district
3864102	3885411	knows about this at this point and I'll just be honest I don't see myself even if I like the project I don't see myself voting for it unless I think that You guys your boss has done the work necessary to sell this to the public and to sell this to the people who are here now Not necessarily the people who are here when I wasn't legally able to drink.
3885852	3892000	Thanks Thank You secretary Dr. Geisinger
3893228	3898235	Thank you and thank you both for all your work and and all the team.
3898896	3900999	I agree with director music.
3901019	3905304	This is the way to get the service done and the starter service.
3906085	3907848	I have a couple of questions.
3908929	3913195	You mentioned that 42 million will be coming from the state.
3913647	3915571	How does that come?
3915852	3919040	Is the 230 money come out of CTE?
3919080	3921345	And how much is that?
3921445	3929985	And the CTIO then put in, I mean, is that a total of several different contributions from those different groups?
3930337	3934303	Yeah, that is a total of several different contributions.
3934423	3948683	And so I think it would be a mixture of CTIO investing in the projects that the construction projects that they would invest in finance and probably oversee the execution of same thing for CTE.
3948663	3962917	And then the, you know, in the March 1st report, we weren't sure if the Chrissy Grant projects would get done because they were under review of the new administration that has since been green lighted by the new administration.
3962997	3970905	And so that would probably be a new contribution that would be reflected in the mixture of contributions.
3971326	3977792	And those monies came from the governor's IHA cash fund.
3978093	3979696	to match the federal funds.
3980778	3981379	Good, thanks.
3982140	3989753	And just one other comment, which is that I think this happened in one of the statues, 161.
3989853	3991556	It's 161, yeah.
3992518	4000371	But I think that joint service talking about being Northwest Rail is
4000351	4001132	confusing.
4001573	4011389	And maybe it's better to maybe the language is important that it's service on the Northwest Corridor to sort of pull apart.
4011569	4017839	Northwest Rail was defined in, you know, Fast Tracks Project.
4018680	4026713	And so it's just a thought and maybe something we can we can talk about after we see the IGA and all of that.
4026811	4027572	Thank you very much.
4027993	4029234	Diane, did you have something there?
4029615	4030937	You look like you were going to respond.
4031037	4036184	I was just going to say that the statute uses Northwest Fixed Guideway.
4038888	4040089	Thank you, Director Geisinger.
4040850	4047359	Director Isha.
4047680	4048981	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
4050363	4055350	So as usual, Director Catlin got to a question before I did.
4055903	4071078	And I just wanted to offer that I had, up until this moment, always assumed that Dr. Cog would need to be involved because of just a plain language reading of statute.
4071258	4080187	So I would also add that if we need to clarify that, we should do that as soon as practical, which would be next session.
4081849	4084071	But I,
4087426	4101205	I also I feel like I owe the you and my colleagues that just honesty that my district fast tracks is not something I hear about in my district.
4103208	4104369	Nor is this project.
4105050	4107293	I've been on the board for two and a half years.
4108555	4116606	And I think I have been asked about it less than 10 times and half of them are from reporters to be to be honest.
4118307	4134064	And so I have some concern that proponents of the project aren't doing the necessary work in my district, which is very active in local matters to get their buy-in.
4135586	4141632	And even if we move forward without...
4142101	4151251	FRPR having statutory authority to tax because it was granted by the voters or, you know, we have some sort of alternative method.
4153714	4158620	At the end of the day, we are going to be held responsible by the larger public.
4159040	4161924	And it's really crucial to ensure that we have their buy-in.
4162765	4164266	So the feedback I gave was anecdotal.
4164647	4166969	That's just my experience.
4167870	4171855	But I would feel
4173623	4189006	irresponsible if I didn't put that out there because it really does worry me that we might be getting married without a prenup or we're moving too quickly but we don't have public buy-in.
4190968	4194113	So just like in other parts of
4194667	4200594	RTD where the fact that these projects were not finished creates distrust.
4201515	4211427	We have to remember that not all parts of the district or the greater region share that sentiment.
4212429	4220218	And we just need to be careful in how we move forward because at the end of the day, no matter what happens in this boardroom or at the state level,
4220350	4226076	or the executive level, we are ultimately going to respond to the taxpayers.
4229580	4235566	I would like to see this project and all rail projects get built out.
4237348	4240952	I don't like cars and I don't like concrete jungles.
4242154	4249041	I have concerns about the fiscal aspect that I think
4249662	4252746	First Vice-Gerald Keith summed up much more eloquently than I could.
4255470	4257352	But I would like to think it's possible.
4258033	4260456	So I'm looking for a reason to say yes.
4261397	4263420	And I just need a little bit more to get there.
4264301	4271431	And that's a bit painful to say in a public meeting with my colleagues.
4271771	4279281	But at this juncture, it doesn't do any of us any good if we are not forthright in where we are.
4279531	4287039	So, thank you for letting me speak and that concludes my comments.
4287059	4288000	Thank you, Director Riesha.
4288821	4289982	I have Director Guzman next.
4291324	4292065	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
4293426	4296470	I have to second First Vice Chair O'Keefe.
4296770	4302656	There's absolutely no way I would vote for this if we're going to just completely empty out what everybody perceives to be the big piggy bank, the FICE account.
4303137	4305960	That 190 million is not just for rail.
4306244	4309909	as has been purported and reported and re-reported incorrectly.
4310090	4314877	There were caveats with that money for how it was to be used in conjunction with the fast-tracks plans.
4315358	4317941	And I think that we need to go back to the legislation and look at that.
4317982	4323830	Also, the FISA account was created after the .04% sales and use tax was collected.
4324231	4328337	And there are additional monies that are in there that are also not
4328570	4336062	directly linked to that legislation and so untangling that could be a big mess but also we need to be responsible with it as is our fiduciary duty.
4337104	4351827	It does support services along the northwest corridor, not just the fixed rail but also other bus services and connections that were part of the anticipated cost of moving people around.
4351908	4357134	And it supports the maintenance and the transit asset management along that rail.
4357194	4370371	And so one thing that I have not heard come out of these conversations that is going to be, it's going to keep me on the no side until I understand it in terms of an IGA, is how we are going to plan the transit asset management piece of this.
4370451	4372814	How are we going to do maintenance and repair work?
4372934	4376498	Because the cost of a shiny new thing is one thing.
4376596	4382403	but maintaining it to continue good usage and safety for the public is a completely different matter.
4382883	4392454	And we have just spent the last two summers, I'm gonna include the current one we're walking into now, doing exactly that work because it was forgotten for more than 20 years.
4393816	4396459	And it cannot happen with this project.
4396939	4404848	So if money is not set aside or anticipated with all the glory of putting a brand new shiny train on a track to get people moving,
4405030	4409234	and continue to maintain that asset by all members of the IGA?
4410455	4412296	Absolutely not.
4412316	4414618	There's no way we can continue forward with the conversation.
4414678	4415579	It's not even worth having.
4416280	4420824	So if that money is not accounted for somewhere in the finance planning of doing this, there's no way we would do it.
4421184	4421965	And why do I say that?
4422005	4423666	Because safety has to come first.
4423746	4425388	Human lives are at risk and at danger.
4425448	4434075	So as you spoke to the positive trend control and all of the other necessary infrastructure to do this, maintenance of these tracks and these
4434376	4446828	Conveyances are going to be equally important and should not be put to the side in a rush to get a train on a track That's not how we do things and that's not how we should do things in my opinion So that's one part.
4447649	4460822	Sorry my comment The other thing is we I have a big concern about cannibalizing our regular service when the language that you put on the screen earlier says we will I believe it was will strive
4461494	4473489	to implement the joint service plan that will not render infeasible the existing operations of RTD from or for, from or the future plans for FRPRD.
4474591	4476934	We are running an active transit agency.
4477154	4487027	We have services going, we collect a sales and use tax of a total of 1%, 0.1%, but it's divided in how we use it with funds being restricted to certain aspects of it.
4487548	4491012	That is where we have to consider how we are going to as a body
4491430	4494073	put money into this and where it's going to come from.
4494874	4508852	But the backstop question is super important because the backstop, if it falls to us to fix the matters that are overrun on finances, can literally cut bus service jobs and take away the things that we are currently providing.
4508872	4521268	And that would not be fair for a three round trip a day service to one particular area of the region because it doesn't take into consideration everybody's need to move around our entire region.
4523476	4524397	That's all I have.
4524417	4524938	Thank you.
4525859	4527180	Thank you, Director Guzman.
4528822	4529383	Director Harwick.
4531225	4543439	I have a few questions and thoughts, but the first question is, you referenced 83 million for the first year of operations, 32 for operations maintenance, 51 in debt service.
4543900	4547203	With that 51 million in mind, what is the amount of debt?
4547223	4551188	I just, if you could remind me, what's the amount of debt that you anticipate taking on?
4553665	4557231	So the March 1st report is that study.
4557332	4564545	So it's looking at how much would it cost in current borrowing to finance the full A85.
4564825	4572940	And that's where you get a debt payment number of $51 million annually to finance the full A85.
4572920	4593274	In regards to Director Guzman's comments, I think it's also important to remember in the March 1st report that when you look at the full horizon of the project, there is baked into the underlying cost assumption, the state of good repair and safety ongoing cost.
4593558	4604198	And so you probably don't remember the bars from the last presentation, but it's in there in those outer years when you have to start replacing and doing the state of good repair work.
4604719	4615600	And what was important about the March 1st report is really looking at not just is there enough existing revenue today, but is there enough existing revenue through 2050?
4615580	4632341	And so the report that Ernst and Young created for us was to look at all of the revenue sources and to look at their growth trajectory to make sure that they also track with the growth trajectory of the state of good repair and escalating costs for the service.
4632862	4638008	And so in that March 1st report that you all got, it did do that work.
4638309	4641773	And where I showed you today that
4642090	4649298	The daily rental car fee grows from $57 million in 2026 and grows to $110 million in 2050.
4650359	4669279	A similar number was in the March 1 presentation to you all of looking at your current revenue at $900 million annually, but that is projected to grow to over $2 billion in 25 years for what RTD is currently projecting to collect and sales tax.
4669613	4679735	So that mapping of the escalating cost in state of good repair against the available revenue sources was cornerstone to the work in the March 1st report.
4681218	4681860	Thank you, Director.
4683082	4686109	Director Nicholson.
4686129	4686490	Thank you.
4687071	4687592	Excuse me.
4687612	4687993	Thank you.
4688260	4693752	So I have a couple of questions that the first one and I promise slightly more fun question than my, my last one.
4695256	4706421	What, when we talk about three trains a day, what kind of hours are we talking about here, because I've heard lots of different sort of understandings of like a what what could I use this for.
4706401	4714997	And if you're running a train back from Denver to Boulder at 5pm, you can use that for a meeting in the middle of the day.
4715057	4717181	You can use that for 6pm or 630.
4717421	4718363	You can use that for commuting.
4718584	4721148	You can't use that to go to a Nuggets game, for example.
4721850	4725777	And so maybe you can help me think about and help the public.
4725757	4735829	What kinds of travel is this gonna serve and what kinds of stuff, because again, it's only three trains a day, is it gonna be outside of?
4735850	4740535	And also, are we talking about three trains a day, seven days a week, or only five days a week?
4740555	4748405	Am I gonna be able to take this down to Pride, for example, if we're running and do that, or would it only be running a weekday service?
4748625	4750768	Thanks, and then I'll have follow-ups, so.
4751491	4764914	Sure, I don't know the schedule that was a part of the RTC modeling off the top of my head, but we can certainly pull that and have that a part of the June presentation if you so desire.
4765494	4772626	But it was for seven days a week and it did adjust for weekend patterns versus weekday.
4773187	4776553	I just don't know the exact times off the top of my head.
4777833	4778274	Appreciate it.
4778294	4787902	Yeah, that would be super helpful because my when I've gotten good questions about this my constituents have asked, what am I going to be able to use it for if I'm in Denver what am I able to be able to do the same thing up in Boulder.
4789085	4789707	Second question.
4790669	4791572	So we got a fairly.
4792345	4799675	sobering, I think is the right word, presentation from our asset management team at our training.
4799815	4804882	I'm a relatively new director, so we get a bunch of different meetings where they explain different stuff to us.
4805743	4820563	And part of that training was over just how freaking expensive it is to manage something like a fixed rail asset over the course of multiple decades and how you really have to think about these things
4820543	4828055	not in terms of what it's going to cost for five years or 10 years, but 20, 30, and then to replace all of it when we get there.
4828155	4843159	And hilariously enough, in an article I think about sound transit too later that day, I came across this wonderful quote from Willie Brown, who is the former speaker of the California State Assembly where I grew up and the former mayor of
4843612	4853786	In a candid admission of how the political world operates, Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco, once dismissed the cost overruns on a transportation hub intended for the bullet train.
4854367	4858572	In the world of civic projects, the first budget is really just a down payment.
4858873	4864320	He wrote in a guest newspaper column in 2013, if people knew the real costs from the start,
4864300	4866042	Nothing would ever get approved.
4866442	4874311	The idea is to get going, start digging a hole and make it so big, there's no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in.
4875032	4878455	Isn't that what joint service, starter service kind of is?
4878516	4880618	Thank you.
4881138	4882360	I'm asking that as a question.
4884983	4893632	I mean, no, because we have a cost estimate through 2050 that was showed to you in the first presentation and map the revenue sources to
4893967	4899835	the projected cost, so I certainly wouldn't characterize it that way.
4900676	4903901	I'll just ask one quick follow-up, is that okay?
4903921	4923788	Given the significant routine cost overruns, as Director O'Keeffe alluded to, that, for example, high-speed rail in California has undergone, where the project has turned out to be billions more expensive than it initially cost, given that we see this in public projects everywhere,
4924072	4929863	What makes you confident as someone who has worked on these things and been in government for a long time?
4930283	4936915	What makes you confident that you're right this time when so often other people get this wrong?
4936935	4943107	I think that the projects that we are looking at from a rail perspective is very different than high speed rail.
4943127	4946653	I mean, I don't even think it's like an apple to a pineapple because
4947089	4958805	Yeah, it's not at the same species really because what we are talking about is utilizing underutilized current infrastructure in the state of Colorado.
4959166	4968439	And what we have seen is an opportunity that exists right now that even is different than when fast tracks passed in 04, when fast tracks passed in 04,
4968419	4971809	There was a lot more freight operations on this line than exists today.
4971869	4978007	BNSF has shifted a lot of their freight operations to the Greeley sub and out east.
4978325	4984214	And that is created this opportunity to utilize an existing infrastructure asset for a new purpose.
4984935	4989702	Um, as we're an afford was in more conflict with their freight operations than it is today.
4990163	4991465	Same thing with mountain rail.
4992086	5003844	Um, we have an opportunity to use an existing asset that is underutilized because of the coal plant closures in Craig and Hayden has created, uh, this capacity on the line, the lines in good shape.
5004125	5006408	It's active today still moving coal.
5006641	5012054	But it's about to be inactive for half of the segment when those coal plants close in 29.
5012094	5020735	And so it's really taking a sunk cost from an infrastructure perspective and repurposing it for a future need.
5021103	5022905	is how I would see these projects.
5023286	5038425	And I think what's different about the way we've approached this and that we've had success with, with at least Union Pacific and the mountain rail access agreement is having an enumerated infrastructure list that corresponds with the actual daily round trips.
5038546	5049760	So the way that access agreement reads is for these daily round trips, three of them, here's the actual infrastructure that is needed to empower that on this timeline.
5050043	5057033	And certainly, if that infrastructure list is priced out 20 years from now, the escalation cost is going to be different.
5057114	5061300	But we have plans to do those infrastructure projects this calendar year.
5061320	5065206	So we believe our cost estimates are good.
5065626	5068391	I don't think anything is ever bulletproof.
5068411	5077384	But I think that the benefit to the state of Colorado that we would get from these projects of taking cars off the road and
5077550	5087746	driving better land use decisions where we have housing in fill to get to a smart growth strategy for the state of Colorado is worthy of the cause.
5088187	5092874	And I think we have paved a much different way than what California has done.
5092894	5102089	And certainly I think we are all students of having watched what California has done and paved a different way forward in Colorado.
5102407	5108164	that has as much certainty around it as you possibly can for a big public infrastructure project.
5109427	5109788	Thank you.
5110609	5112091	I'm going to go to Director Paculari.
5112172	5114175	I saw his hand and I'll come back to you, Secretary.
5114876	5115497	Thank you, Chair.
5115838	5117961	Thank you, Des, for your presentation.
5118001	5119584	Appreciate it.
5120586	5125394	I think I just want to start out by saying the front range needs rail, needs passenger rail service.
5125614	5129080	We have a growing population, people moving here and bringing their cars.
5129120	5130983	We have increased poor air quality.
5131524	5133527	There's a lot of reasons why we need rail.
5134098	5138904	And there's so many reasons that in 2003, the people said we need rail, and they asked for it.
5139665	5143730	And time and time again, people have asked for it over and over again.
5143750	5148075	And the legislator, even this year, said once again, we need rail.
5149097	5153322	RCD, you have to build the rail that you promised to build back from the voters, said you had to build rail.
5153642	5159970	So I'd like to keep to our commitment towards at least doing what we can to finish fast tracks.
5159950	5168597	Because we need rail, but I do have a little bit of a few concerns and I think I'll just highlight one concern and a question first and then a concern.
5170222	5171867	I guess they're tied together, but.
5172488	5175813	three round trips per day is starter service.
5176534	5181401	It's useful transit for some, but not as many as 10 round trips or 12.
5182202	5193899	I'd really like to see the movement towards double tracking so we can get those higher frequencies and make this a really useful transit service for the people along the front range and in the front range district.
5195301	5195762	But
5195742	5203412	With what we're building and what we're committing, this IGA, first of all, is just allowing something to go forward so we can get more information.
5203492	5204974	We're not committing any funds yet.
5205434	5207237	So I do hope you support the IGA.
5208438	5217109	But in the IGA, I would like to see some type of assurance that we can continue on the path towards those 10, 12 round trips per day or double tracking.
5217089	5224322	And if it's possible, the legislators already given FRPRD and then revenue for collecting revenue.
5224362	5235402	I don't really see in the future the state giving us a couple of million dollars to build double tracked front range messenger rail, but the people could choose to do it so I would like.
5235382	5253387	I guess my question then to not lead, sorry, but the leading question is if it would be possible to do, put some assurances in that would require this new entity with IGA to pursue expanded service and not just stop at three trains for day.
5253688	5254048	Thank you.
5256610	5257632	Thanks, yeah.
5257652	5263180	And I think that's important feedback as to what the board would like in the IGA.
5264041	5266265	And so we could certainly take that back.
5267767	5268128	Thank you.
5269129	5269790	Thank you, Director.
5270812	5271012	All right.
5271072	5272414	Any further comments, questions?
5273355	5274738	Secretary and then Director Guzman.
5275899	5276280	Thank you.
5276961	5277862	Two very quick things.
5277882	5281588	So first off, I just want to make an important point.
5282193	5283074	I want this train.
5283495	5286498	I actually really, really want this train.
5286638	5293246	I am one of a handful of people on the board who doesn't have a car getting to Boulder, getting to Longmont.
5293306	5296050	This would be, and I live like 10 minutes from Union Station.
5296150	5302317	This would be a massive improvement in my quality of life, getting up to, getting up the Northwest.
5302958	5306542	And for exactly the reason that you alluded to, Ms.
5306582	5312149	Kaufman, this is an opportunity to build a ton of new housing in a place that badly needs it.
5312129	5313892	make it easier for people to get to Denver.
5313912	5317738	There are lots of reasons in principle to like this project.
5317798	5323246	The same way that I like the idea of having a summer home in Bali or a winter home.
5323667	5326291	The question is, can I afford it?
5327192	5328935	And can I make it work?
5329876	5331599	Does the access of me flying out there?
5332220	5336647	So really, it just comes down to I'm putting you through the paces on this.
5336887	5337788	I'm running the traps.
5338329	5340212	I'm making this as difficult as I am.
5340547	5347296	Because as someone who's been involved in government since I was 18, I am terrified.
5348297	5360192	Genuinely freaked out, you know, have had mild panic attacks over this decision because I don't want to turn 50 or 55 or 60 and look back.
5360408	5363493	and say, wow, I signed on to a gigantic money pit.
5363994	5373729	On the other hand, I don't want to look back and say, wow, I missed out on signing on to one of the best expansions of passenger rail that we were ever going to have.
5374110	5377556	So it doesn't come from a place of disliking the project.
5377936	5384627	It comes from a place of gigantic amounts of fear over the significance of this decision.
5385586	5386507	I appreciate that.
5386527	5402705	I think it's really well-founded given the history of this project and the way we've grown as a metro area and the needs that we have in a metro area for more transit and rail and the constraints that we have around revenue as a state and how we can gain new revenue as a state.
5402766	5408472	So I think all of that thoughtful approach is warranted, which is partly why
5408789	5423592	You know, the step that we are contemplating now is can we all agree on how we would make joint decisions to then go negotiate with BNSF, come back to the governing boards with the result of that and say,
5423875	5426561	is this ROI worth it?
5426842	5439591	And that would come after a successful negotiation that would enumerate the infrastructures that has to correspond with the access agreement for daily round trips.
5439611	5442778	And at that juncture, I think you would have a big decision to be made.
5443113	5451823	And we would have a lot more information on, we have verified the infrastructure list with BNSF, we have, you know, the engineers priced that out.
5452624	5457810	And then we have a financial model on how it would work, right?
5457910	5466640	So, you know, does it make sense for CTIO who has bonding capacity to finance all of PTC?
5467025	5480123	that would be enumerated in the finance plan, like how, which piece of which puzzle would look at the finance plan based off of that infrastructure list, obviously RTD.
5480457	5485944	um, would need to look at just infrastructure costs within the RTD region, not outside of it.
5486064	5489789	So, you know, I think we're, you know, attempting to eat an elephant.
5489889	5491992	We have to do it chunk by chunk here.
5492313	5501665	And it's really getting to a place where we all agree on how we're going to operate together to collaborate, to get to an access agreement.
5501925	5507933	And then once we have an access agreement, how do we create a finance plan based off of that agreement?
5508200	5512750	and then you all will have a big decision to be made on the ROI of that investment.
5513812	5517761	We just can't get there without having those negotiations first.
5519686	5520066	Thank you.
5520748	5526681	Based on the sake of time, I'm going to have Treasurer Banker and then Director Guzman as our final two.
5528112	5529655	Thank you.
5530196	5538733	You know, one of the things we haven't really talked about, and I was hoping that we could get to it in our executive session, but time is going by fast.
5539275	5543944	We can extend also and start our board meeting late too.
5543924	5548933	I've been trying to meet with as many of our board directors as possible and I'm hoping to meet with everybody.
5549775	5551358	I've been working.
5551859	5554544	I think you all know I've been working on these numbers for a long time.
5555125	5558331	But last year, the state legislature gave us two new revenue sources.
5558811	5560735	So when we're talking about.
5560715	5572186	Oh my, this project looks, first of all, cost estimates we're getting right now are very reasonable, much less than what they were even a couple of years ago.
5573107	5575189	But we now have some new revenue sources out there.
5575749	5587701	And actually, I was hoping Lisa wasn't going to hear me do some of this, but if you go in and you take a look at the two new bills that were passed last year and the different pots of money that they put the money in,
5588238	5594569	we have, or the state has, $174 million a year of new money.
5595646	5599770	that we need to ask for and write a grant for.
5600370	5604254	So if you're talking about RTD money, this could be RTD money.
5604854	5605575	Sorry, Lisa.
5606396	5609979	But this is where we need to talk with the state.
5610659	5612261	We need to do some negotiation.
5613102	5617786	And when we're talking about how it's going to hurt our budget, this is all new.
5617826	5619447	This is all new money.
5619467	5624792	$174 million the state legislature gave us last year
5625093	5626114	for transit.
5626134	5627155	Now is it all RTD?
5627536	5628637	No, probably not.
5629318	5630399	It could chunk if it could be.
5631640	5633202	A big chunk of it could be.
5634043	5644215	And this is where I was hoping as a board that we could talk about this because again, we can debate FISA and we will and we should.
5645276	5648179	And there's a lot of things that we can talk about with FISA.
5650962	5653345	But there's so much new money on the table.
5654472	5659998	There's so much opportunity and we've got some great partners here to make it happen.
5660638	5668866	And so if we do go into special session, you know, go ahead and pass out my last Excel spreadsheet here.
5669707	5673051	I keep making tweaks to it and I will continue to do it.
5673791	5680378	But I guess I just didn't want the board to think that it's going to be coming mostly or
5681928	5685392	coming out of our base budget because it doesn't have to.
5686093	5690378	It could come out of the new money that the state legislature has opened up for us.
5690819	5691740	So thank you.
5692020	5692581	Hey, Treasurer.
5692701	5697307	Can I say one thing on that is it's also not just the last two bills that passed.
5697367	5709842	And actually, if you go back and you look at Senate bill 260 that passed in 2021, one of the things that we created in that was the new delivery fee.
5709822	5717357	And the delivery fee was created in order to help public agencies that need to refleet to low to zero emissions.
5717818	5721266	And it created around $60 million in the first five years.
5721346	5727358	So it's that 29 cents that shows up on your Amazon bill every time you get Amazon.
5727338	5733285	And that, you know, we would love to partner with RTD on their refleeting strategy.
5733846	5739513	Obviously, refleeting for air quality improvements is a big priority for us.
5740033	5742076	And so it's not just on these rail projects.
5742136	5744379	Do we want to be a collaborative funding partner?
5744439	5752549	It's really on all of the needs that RTD has as we try to reach our mutual goals around expanding transit and rail service for the metro area.
5753069	5753650	And so
5753849	5773883	not just the rail projects is important for you to hear me say there's all sorts of money that we have created to partner with RTD on that we want to partner with RTD on and really think about how we maximize public financing tools that we have at the state in order to get to our broader vision of a smart growth strategy for the state of Colorado.
5775128	5775509	Thank you.
5776050	5776672	Director Griezmann.
5777334	5778096	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
5778978	5780903	I also want to see this project get done.
5781023	5787299	I voted for it when it was first in front of me on a ballot, when I was early voting as a young child, right?
5787640	5790808	Like, let's be real, okay?
5793067	5793768	Well, yeah.
5793788	5794068	OK.
5794488	5796711	It feels a long time ago now.
5797031	5807341	So I get the frustration of all of my long monsters who have been emailing me lovingly about trying to approve something that we're actually not making a decision on right now.
5807442	5809624	But I do understand the frustration and consternation.
5809644	5813067	And I don't want to be burnt in effigy and longmont by anybody.
5813388	5813688	OK.
5813968	5820795	I represent Denver and my concern as a director needs to be to my sub district first and then to the benefit of the entire region.
5821501	5825232	I appreciate the outreach for partnership from the state.
5825292	5830127	That's the first time I've heard it given to us that way and explained to us that way.
5830448	5832374	And I would like to do that partnership as well.
5832915	5835443	But I am hesitant to reach my handout in return.
5835727	5840953	When every time I turn around, I'm attacked or the board is attacked or the agency is attacked by the state.
5841113	5858393	And so from me to the administration of our state right now, I would really appreciate it if you guys would work with us so that we can have a better relationship because right now I am once bitten and twice shy, which puts me in a defensive mode over my agency as is my fiduciary duty of loyalty.
5858845	5868260	Um, my question though is for our missing partner who is not, I believe, represented here, but when is FRPRD gonna get their taxing situation in order and go to the voters?
5868360	5872667	Because we can do a lot within the regional transportation district geography.
5873348	5876874	Beyond that, I wouldn't vote to commit any money outside of it.
5877074	5879418	And I don't believe we are legally allowed to do so.
5879638	5884085	There was some change in the law, but I still didn't understand whether that allowed us to do that or not.
5884185	5884566	And so,
5885153	5888804	Just a final question that can come back later in the report next month.
5889907	5897089	What's going on with our partner that is absent at this point because their funding has come from the state and not from their own resources?
5898072	5898353	Thanks.
5899109	5900371	Yeah, it's a great question.
5900491	5910363	And it's partly why we have kind of jumped into the fray to start trying to figure out how to create this collaborative approach to funding these projects.
5910443	5922417	And, and again, why I think it's important for you to hear me say it's not just about funding Northwest Rails commitment to the voters, but it's about completion of all the on finish fast tracks projects because
5922397	5938255	We have pulled multiple times front range passenger rail and it is not currently viable at the ballot because of the voters skepticism that they we all collectively could be trusted with a new revenue source to do a rail project because of the hangover of fast tracks.
5938815	5952150	And so, you know, it's a big barrier to going back to the voters and asking for increased resources is that they don't have an answer to this outstanding problem.
5952434	5968391	And so I think it's incumbent on everyone who is trying to provide the best transit service and expanded service for Colorado to try to see how we problem solve around that because it's not just FRPR that is suffering from it.
5968851	5974837	It will be the case if RTD needs to go back to the voters for new transit money.
5974858	5977260	It will be the case if there's new RTAs
5977527	5986560	in the metro area that would like to stand up service is that this is a big barrier to voters approving any additional resources.
5989745	5990105	Thank you.
5991547	5992228	Director Russia.
5994852	5996194	Thank you, Mr. Chair.
5996782	6007056	I, my ears perked up when I heard polling and I have not seen the polling that was just referenced and so I was wondering if, if that's something that's available or could be shared.
6008437	6009959	I think that would be helpful for the board.
6009999	6011061	Thank you.
6012342	6013844	Thank you.
6013864	6014205	Sure.
6014225	6021895	I'm happy to share the slide deck that I did to Colorado rails meeting a couple of weekends ago that has some of those pertinent slides in it.
6024406	6029194	Well, Miss Barrett, Miss Kaufman, do you want to greatly appreciate you for your time.
6029214	6032339	Thank you directors for comments and questions.
6032800	6043117	We're looking forward to our June report and hopefully the feedback and questions that were presented this evening will be helpful going forward.
6043357	6044359	So I want to thank you both.
6044619	6044980	Thank you.
6051136	6059591	Alright, in a moment, the board will meet an executive session regarding a proposed intergovernmental agreement related to joint service for the Northwest rail corridor.
6060452	6070410	I'd like to amend the emotion to move into executive session to state that the special board meeting will be during deemed adjourned after adjourns into the executive session.
6070998	6079048	For public transparency, this means that once the board moves into executive session, the main meeting will be adjourned for anyone who might be in the room or remote.
6079729	6095710	The regular scheduled board meeting will occur after this meeting with the anticipated start time of, I'm going to say 6.30, it might be a little bit longer, but anticipated start time of 6.30.
6096591	6098794	So please know that we'll be back then.
6099483	6103808	I'll now entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following.
6104388	6126292	So 24-6-402-4E for determining positions relative to the matter that may be subject to negotiations, developing strategy for negotiations and instructing negotiators, and 24-6-402-4B for legal advice regarding proposed intergovernment agreement and joint service for the Northwest Rail Corridor.
6126532	6129135	Do I have a mover?
6129453	6130835	Nicholson, do I have a second?
6131556	6131937	Second.
6133219	6135263	I'm gonna go with Dr. Pagulari, thank you.
6138388	6141473	All right, for all those who are expected to attend, would you please stay seated?
6141513	6142254	Yes.
6144037	6145860	Oh, excuse me, are there any no votes?
6148164	6153132	Seeing none, that'll pass 14, zero, and one absent.
6154293	6157956	All right, for those expected 10, would you please stay seated?
6158177	6162987	And for everyone else, would you please vacate the room at this time and take all your belongings with you?
